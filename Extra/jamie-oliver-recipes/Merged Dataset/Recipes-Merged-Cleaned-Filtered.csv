Put the tins to one side and allow to cool. To make the pastry, score the vanilla pod lengthways (if using), and scape out the seeds (keep the pod for making vanilla sugar). Cream the butter, icing sugar and a small pinch of sea salt together, then rub in the flour. Add the vanilla seeds, finely grate in the lemon zest and add the egg yolks - you can do all this by hand or in a food processor. When the mixture looks like coarse breadcrumbs, add the cold milk (or use water). Pat and gently work the mixture together until you have a ball of dough, then flour it lightly and roll into a large sausage shape - don't work the pastry too much otherwise it will become elastic and chewy, not flaky and short as you want it to be. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and place in the fridge to rest for at least 1 hour. Remove it from the fridge, slice it up and line a 28cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Push the slices together, then tidy up the sides by trimming off any excess. Place the tart mould into the freezer for 1 hour.

Place the apples on top and pour any remaining juices over. Bake at the bottom of the oven for 40 minutes, to give you a crisp base and bubbling toffee over the apples. Serve with yoghurt or vanilla ice cream. Beautiful!"

Press the oysters into the filling, and drizzle over any juices. Finely grate over the Parmesan, then, starting with one of the shortest edges, roll up the pork, patting on and compacting the stuffing as you go. Tie six pieces of string along the rolled meat to secure it, with the seam underneath, then season well and drizzle with oil, rubbing it all over the skin - this will help you get delicious crackling. Put the pork into a large roasting tray and place in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and crackled. Meanwhile, halve the apples and carrots, then peel and quarter the onions. Remove the pork from the oven and carefully place the apples and veg underneath the pork in the tray, then return to the oven and reduce the temperature to 180°C/350°F/gas 4.

I'm told Rhys makes a mean toad-in-the-hole, and I hope they enjoy this version for years to come. In Yorkshire, I learned how real Yorkshire folk approach making a great Yorkie. They aren't into making their batter the night before, instead they focus on getting plenty of air into the batter and achieving a hot consistent temperature in the oven. I truly love this great classic and have only ever had one issue with it: quite often, you end up with half a sausage (the toad) poking out of the Yorkshire (the hole). The bit sticking out is crispy and golden - good times - but the other half of the sausage, inside the batter, is soft, anaemic and boiled - bad times. So in the spirit of family-style sharing and creating a dish that makes everyone go â€˜Oooh!' I'm separating out the elements so you end up with amazing crispy sausages, a tray of giant Yorkshire to tear up and a wonderful onion and apple gravy. Heaven. Whisk the eggs, flour, milk and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then pour into a jug. Preheat the oven to full whack (about 240°C/475°F/gas 9). Cut your onions into 1cm thick slices, and do the same with the apples - removing the core. Put a large pan on a medium heat. Add the butter, a lug of olive oil, the onions and the apples. Pick in the leaves from 2 sprigs of rosemary. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden. Remove the sauce from the heat once soft, season, and add the honey and a splash of water, if needed. Put the sausages into a sturdy roasting tray (roughly 30 x 40cm), toss with a little olive oil and cook in the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden. Transfer the cooked sausages to a pretty ovenproof dish and toss with half the apple and onion sauce. Cover with tin foil. Remove any excess fat from the roasting tray, replace with a good lug of olive oil and place on a medium heat. Add the remaining rosemary leaves and after 30 seconds, pour in the batter, then put straight into the middle of the oven with the sausages on the shelf underneath. Cook for around 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pudding is fluffy, golden and puffing up at the sides. Whatever you do, do not open the oven door. Put the pan of apples and onions back on a high heat and stir in the flour. Be brave; let it get really golden before adding the cider, stock and a couple of really good splashes of Worcestershire sauce. Let it boil and bubble away until thickened to your liking. Get your guests to the table, with their knives and forks in their hands. Put the bubbling gravy on a board in the middle of the table. Remove and uncover your sizzling sausages, then slide your Yorkshire pudding on to a nice board. This lovely dish definitely needs balancing, so serve with something green and fresh, like runner beans, greens, salad or dressed chard."

You could make your own pasta if you have a machine - it's a fun activity for everyone to get involved in. Fill a large saucepan with water, add a big pinch of sea salt and bring it to the boil. Peel the vegetables into ribbons with a speed peeler. Set aside. Break the eggs into a big mixing bowl, add the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che and Parmesan cheese, and finely grate in the lemon zest. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper, then mix well. Cook the pasta in the large pan of boiling water according to the packet directions. Heat a glug of oil in a large pan. Chop and add the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes, until crisp. Setting aside a cupful of water, drain the pasta. Off the heat, add the pasta to the pancetta, pick in most of the mint, then add the veg ribbons, egg mixture and a splash of pasta water. Stir it all together, then add more pasta water if you think it needs it. Dish it up, then top each bowl with the remaining mint leaves and an extra grating of Parmesan."

Gradually add 125ml of cold water, continuously mixing until it comes together to form a rough dough, adding a splash more water, if needed. Bring it together with your hands, wrap in clingfilm and place in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Snap off and discard the woody ends from the asparagus, then slice the stalks into 1cm chunks, reserving the tips.

Instead of putting a lid on, put a large bowl on top but don't let it touch the water. Put the butter, a pinch of salt and pepper and the juice of 1 lemon into the bowl. This is going to sound cheffy, but it's simple, so bear with me ... Tear off 8 sheets of good- quality cling film, each roughly 40cm square. Get yourself 4 teacups or small bowls and rub the rims with olive oil. Place a double layer of cling film on top of each one and carefully push it in so that it snugly lines the cups. Use your finger to lightly oil the inside - this will help your egg come out easily at the end. Put a tiny pinch of salt, pepper and chilli flakes into each cup then pick the celery and tarragon leaves and divide them between the cups too - try to help these flavours to spread up the sides, if you can. Carefully crack the egg into the cling film, then gently push the yolk down so the egg white surrounds it (without it breaking). Bring the cling film up into a bundle, then tie it in a knot and try to squeeze the knot down so it creates a perfect pouch and seals it (imagine a goldfish in a fairground plastic bag). Once the water is boiling, remove the bowl (the butter should be melted now) and place your eggs in the water along with the asparagus. It takes between 5 and 6 minutes at a gentle simmer for a large egg. Place the bowl or a lid back on top and after 3 or 4 minutes remove the asparagus to the bowl of lemony butter and quickly toss. Meanwhile, arrange 2 pieces of smoked salmon on each plate. Pull out one of your eggs after 5 minutes and have a little feel (it should have a similar texture to fresh mozzarella). If it still seems undercooked, pop it back in for another minute or so. Neatly divide the asparagus between your plates. Cut off the cling film knots with a pair of scissors, peel away the rest, then carefully lift the eggs with a tablespoon and serve them right on top of your asparagus. If youâ€˜ve done a good job, not only will you have perfect poached eggs, but the herbs and seasonings will have cooked into the egg and become one, like a stained glass window, which is really cute. Poke a knife into the egg to let the yolk run, and serve with wedges of lemon on the side."

Season your beautiful fish fillets with the rosemary, finely grated lemon zest (no bitter white pith, please) and pepper - you don't need to use salt because we're going to wrap the fish in the lovely salty smoked bacon. Lay your rashers of bacon or pancetta on a board and one by one run the flat of a knife along them to thin them and widen them out. Lay 3 rashers together, slightly overlapping, put a fish fillet on top and wrap the rashers around it. Lightly heat a large ovenproof frying pan, add a splash of olive oil and lay your fish, prettiest side facing up, in the pan. Fry for a minute, then place the pan in your preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish, until the bacon is crisp and golden. While the fish is cooking, you can make your simple lemon mayonnaise. I do this by mixing quality low-fat mayonnaise with the juice of half a lemon and pepper. You want to add enough lemon juice to make the flavour slightly too zingy. This is because, when you eat it with the asparagus and the fish, it will lessen slightly in intensity. And don't worry if the mayo looks a little thinner than usual when you've added the lemon juice - think of it as more delicate. The asparagus is a great accompaniment because, like the fish, it also loves bacon. You can either boil or steam it; either way it's light and a nice contrast to the meatiness of the fish. When cooked, toss it in the juices that come out of the fish. Simply serve the fish next to a nice pile of asparagus, drizzled with the lemon-spiked mayonnaise. And if you're feeling very hungry, serve with some steaming-hot new potatoes."

Put the soup back on the heat, stir in the asparagus tips, bring back to the boil and simmer for a few more minutes, or until the tips have softened. Just before I'm ready to serve the soup, I get a wide casserole-type pan on the heat with 8 to 10cm of boiling water. Using really fresh eggs, I very quickly crack all 10 into the water. Don't worry about poaching so many at the same time. They don't have to look perfect. A couple of minutes and they'll be done, as you want them to be a bit runny. Toast your ciabatta slices.

Rub the goat's cheese with a little olive oil and cook on a hot griddle on both sides until nicely coloured. Remove and put to one side. Bash up the garlic and lemon thyme in a pestle and mortar (or use a metal bowl and the end of a rolling pin). Add a couple of splashes of olive oil, stir, and rub the mixture all over the pork escalopes. Season the pork then put the escalopes, one by one, between 2 large pieces of cling film and hit them with something heavy and flat until they're about 0.5cm thick. This will make them really tender. Do this to all 4 escalopes. Check that your griddle pan is hot, and chargrill your asparagus, then your courgettes, on both sides. Mark them nicely to give a bit of flavour and character to them. Put them into a salad bowl with the vinegar, 8 tablespoons of olive oil and half the fresh mint. Using the griddle pan again, chargrill your pork escalopes on both sides until nicely marked - about 4 minutes. Tear each escalope in half and scatter these into the salad bowl with the rest of the mint (for a lovely fresh burst of flavour) and the crumbled goat's cheese.

Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a large heavy-bottomed pan on a medium-high heat. Add 3 heaped tablespoons of the curry paste (save the rest for another day) and a splash of coconut milk, then fry for 30 seconds, or until smelling fantastic, stirring continuously. Stir in the chicken, then, after 5 minutes, pour in the remaining coconut milk and bring to the boil, stirring regularly. Tear in the kaffir lime leaves and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir the palm sugar into the pan and have a taste; the curry should be slightly sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Add the fish sauce and taste again - it should taste well rounded, salty with an underlying sweetness. Quarter the aubergines and add to the pan to cook for 2 to 3 minutes (regular aubergines will take quite a bit longer, so cook until tender), then turn off the heat. Pick and stir in most of the Thai basil, then drain the chilli and sprinkle over with the remaining Thai basil and coriander. Delicious served with jasmine rice."

To me, steamed aubergine sounds horrible but, believe me, this recipe is fantastic. Aubergines are usually fried or roasted, which makes them soak up loads of oil, but steaming means they go really soft and tender so that they're lighter to eat - which means you can eat a lot more! All round the world there are so many different varieties of aubergines - long, round, purple, green - so keep your eyes peeled and try cooking them all. Put some water in a pan and bring it to the boil. Slice the aubergines in half lengthways and place them in your steamer with the cut side facing up. Steam them for about 10 minutes - to check whether they're ready, simply squeeze the sides gently and if they're silky soft then they're done. Remove them from the steamer, place them in a colander and leave to cool. Now make your dressing by mixing all the ingredients together. When the aubergines are warm this is the perfect time to flavour them. Cut them up into rough 2.5cm dice, then dress them and toss.

She inspired me to think of grilling as a really exciting way to prepare vegetables. Wash all your vegetables. Heat the barbecue or a griddle pan, put your whole peppers on it, and get them really black on all sides. While still hot, put them in a bowl, cover with cling film and leave to cool. Slice your courgettes lengthways about 0.5cm thick and do the same with your fennel, reserving the herby tops. Grill the courgette and fennel together on the griddle pan for about a minute on each side or until nicely charred. You don't want them too black or too raw. Transfer to a clean tea towel in one layer, making sure they don't sit on top of each other, otherwise they will steam and go soggy. Cut the aubergine across into slices 1cm inch thick. Every now and again you get an aubergine that is really seedy â€” if this happens, it will be bitter and no good, so throw it away and get yourself another one. Chargrill the aubergine slices, turning them 4 times until nicely marked, then transfer to the tea towel. Boil the baby leeks in salted water until they're just cooked. Then drain, rub with a little olive oil, and chargrill them quickly until lightly marked. Peel the peppers but don't hold them under the tap as all the sweet fantastic flavour will go down the drain. Carefully rub off the black skin, then remove the stalk and pips and tear the peppers up into large strips. Now put all the vegetables into a large bowl. Take about a quarter of your basil leaves and bash them in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of seasoning until you have a smooth pulp. Add about 8 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar, to taste. Pour this over the vegetables and toss quickly so that everything gets coated in the lovely basil oil, then throw in the remaining whole basil leaves. Slice the garlic really thinly to give you a delicate flavour and add to the bowl with the fennel tops. Mix everything together, and serve on a large plate at room temperature. Great with any grilled fish or meat, or as part of an antipasti plate with some toasted bruschetta and some fresh buffalo mozzarella."

Add the tomato flesh or tinned tomatoes to the onion pan, give the mixture a good stir, then put a lid on and simmer slowly for 15 minutes, or until thickened and reduced. Grill the aubergines on both sides until lightly charred - you'll need to work in batches. Season the tomato sauce carefully with sea salt, black pepper and a tiny swig of wine vinegar, then pick in the basil. You can leave the sauce chunky or you can purée it. Spoon a layer of tomato sauce into a 15cm x 25cm baking dish, then add a fine scattering of Parmesan, followed by a single layer of aubergines.

Pour the chutney into a small bowl and chill in the fridge while you make your fritters. Place the gram flour, spices and mango powder in a large bowl and whisk in 150ml to 180ml of cold water until it forms a thin batter. Cut the aubergines into 3mm rounds. In a deep saucepan, pour in sunflower oil to a depth of at least 2.5cm and bring it to 180°C over a medium heat - test this with a thermometer, or drop in a cube of bread and when it bubbles immediately the oil is ready. Using metal tongs, dip each aubergine slice in the batter, shake off the excess, then slide it into the hot oil. Do this in batches and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp. Carefully remove from the oil and leave to drain on kitchen paper, seasoning with sea salt while still hot.

(Try to remove as much of the flesh as possible, but a little left in the shell is fine). You'll now have four empty avocado skin halves. Using a clean pastry brush, brush the inside of the avocado shells with a layer of melted chocolate until evenly covered. Transfer to a tray and place in the fridge for 10 minutes until set. Repeat this process two more times, until you've applied three layers of chocolate. Return the tray to the fridge for half an hour, or until set completely. Meanwhile, place the pan and bowl back on a low-medium heat, snap in the remaining dark chocolate and leave to melt. Once melted, add the chocolate to the food processor with the cocoa powder, vanilla bean paste, maple syrup, coconut cream and a pinch of salt, and pulse for a few seconds to combine. Scrape down the sides with a spatula, then pulse again, until smooth. Scrape into a bowl, cover and leave in the fridge until needed (but no longer than 2 hours). Once the chocolate shells are set, gently peel the avocado skins away from the shells and discard. Heat a tablespoon in a jug of boiling water for a few seconds. Now it's time to get a bit creative with your presentation: using the hot spoon, roll up 1 tablespoon of the chocolate mousse for each serving plate (you will end up with about half of the chocolate mixture leftover, please see tip below). Press the chocolate shells onto the mousse, filling each with a little fruit (I used halved strawberries and blueberries, orange segments and a couple of amarena cherries).

Peel and finely chop the onion, then place into a small bowl with the lime zest and juice. Toss together and leave to one side for 5 to 10 minutes. Finely chop the prawns and mix together with the crabmeat and aji amarillo paste, seasoning well. Mix in the onions, leaving behind the excess juice. Line up 3 bowls - one with flour, one with beaten eggs and one with breadcrumbs. Place a scoop of mashed potato in your hand and roll into a ball (roughly 4cm in diameter). Press a hole in the middle with your thumb, about 2cm deep, and spoon in some prawn and crab mixture. Close the hole as gently as you can to conceal the filling, then repeat until you've used up all the mash and filling - you should end up with around 15 croquettes. Roll each croquette in the flour, dip it into the egg (letting the excess drip off), then coat in breadcrumbs. Pour the vegetable oil into a large pan and gently heat to 180°C (a cube of bread dropped into the oil will turn brown within 1 minute). Gently lower the croquettes into the oil with a slotted spoon and fry for around 4 minutes, or until golden and crisp - you'll need to do this in batches. Drain the cooked croquettes on kitchen paper, then serve hot on a plate smeared with the guacamole."

Remove the chicken from the fridge and leave to come up to room temperature. Pick the thyme leaves and bash in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, then rub all over the chicken with a lug of olive oil. Halve the lemon, peel and bash the garlic bulb, then stuff inside the chicken cavity. Place the bird in a snug-fitting roasting tray and pop in the hot oven for around 1 hour 30 minutes, or until cooked through. To check, insert a knife into the thickest part of the thigh - if the juices run clear and the meat pulls away from the bone, you know it's done. Meanwhile, place the flour and a pinch of salt in a large bowl, then gradually add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 150ml of cold water, stirring continuously until the mixture comes together to form a rough dough. Transfer to a flour-dusted surface and knead for around 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic, then shape into a long sausage shape, roughly 45cm in length. Slice the dough into 16 equal-sized pieces, roll into balls, then set aside for later. To make the salsa, preheat a griddle pan over a high heat. Prick the chillies all over with a small sharp knife, remove and discard the papery skin from the tomatillos, then place on the griddle. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until blackened all over, turning occasionally. Trim the spring onions and peel the clove of garlic. Pick the mint leaves into a food processor and add the chillies, tomatillos, spring onions, garlic and the remaining salsa ingredients with a couple of generous pinches of salt, then whiz until smooth. Once cooked, allow the chicken to cool slightly, then strip away the flesh, shredding it as you go (wear rubber gloves if it's too hot). On a flour-dusted surface, roll the dough balls into circles, roughly the thickness of a playing card. Preheat a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat, then add the tortillas (you'll need to do this in batches) and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly golden, turning halfway. Wrap the tortillas in tin foil to keep warm as you go. Meanwhile, shred the lettuce, quarter the cherry tomatoes, then halve and destone the avocados. Pick the mint and coriander leaves. To assemble the tacos, pop some shredded chicken onto the middle of a tortilla, top with some lettuce, herbs, a few tomatoes and a sprinkling of mixed seeds. Scoop over the avocado flesh, crumble a little feta on top and finish with a drizzle of salsa. Roll up and tuck in."

This fantastic Moroccan-style salad combines roast carrots with avocados - and because they have the same texture in your mouth, I thought I'd add the chargrilled flavour and crunch of toasted ciabatta to round things off. With spices, seeds, yoghurt and a delicious citrus dressing, you've got a winner. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Parboil your carrots in boiling, salted water for 10 minutes, until they are very nearly cooked, then drain and put them into a roasting tray. You should flavour them while they're steaming hot, so while the carrots are cooking get a pestle and mortar and smash up the cumin seeds, chillies, salt and pepper. Add the garlic and thyme leaves and smash up again until you have a kind of paste. The idea here is to build up the flavours. Add enough extra virgin olive oil to generously cover the paste, and a good swig of vinegar. This will be like a marinade, a rub and a dressing all in one! Stir together, then pour over the carrots in the tray, coating them well. Add the orange and lemon halves, cut-side down. These will roast along with the carrots, and their juice can be used as the basis of the dressing. Place in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden.  
While the carrots are roasting, halve and peel your avocados, discarding the stones, then cut them into wedges lengthways and place in a big bowl. Remove the carrots from the oven and add them to the avocados. Carefully, using some tongs, squeeze the roasted orange and lemon juice into a bowl and add the same amount of extra virgin olive oil and a little swig of red wine vinegar. Season, and pour this dressing over the carrots and avocados. Mix together, have a taste and correct the seasoning. Call your gang round the table while you toast or griddle your ciabatta slices. Tear the toasted bread into little pieces and add to the dressed carrot and avocado. Mix together, toss in the salad leaves and cress and transfer to a big platter or divide between individual plates. Spoon over a nice dollop of yoghurt, sprinkle over your toasted seeds and drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil."

Place your wire rack in the tin, so it sits about halfway down, or bend some chicken wire to fit. Carefully pierce the lid of the tin five or six times with a screwdriver. Most salmon fillets come around the same size and thickness, so their cooking times are similar. Sprinkle the salmon fillets with salt and rub with a drizzle of olive oil. Then lay them skin side down on top of the wire (this acts like a grill rack) and put the lid on the tin. Place it on the hob, over a medium heat, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. After a couple of minutes it will start to smoke a bit. While the fish is cooking, mix all the salsa ingredients together - you can go as light or as heavy on the chillies as you like. When the fish is ready, turn the heat off and leave it to sit for 3 minutes before opening the tin. This will allow any residual smoke and heat to penetrate the fish. Lift the salmon fillets out and place on to individual serving plates. Spoon over some chilli salsa and sprinkle with your whole coriander leaves.

Trim, wash and roughly chop the leeks, quarter the unpeeled onions, then add to the tray and roast for 45 minutes, or until golden brown.

Keep aside to reheat at the last minute. When you're ready, remove the beef from the fridge and leave to come up to room temperature. Turn the oven up to full whack (240°C/475°F/gas 9). Score the beef fat in a criss-cross fashion, then rub with 1 tablespoon of oil. In a blender, blitz the peppercorns, 1 tablespoon of salt and the rosemary leaves to a fine dust, then sprinkle and pat all over the beef. Place a large roasting tray on a medium-high heat, carefully sear the beef on all sides, then transfer to the oven. Immediately reduce the temperature to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 and roast for 50 minutes - this will give you medium-rare (cook for a little longer, if you prefer) - then remove to a board.

Quickly but carefully pour the batter into the wells - each should be between half and three-quarters full. Immediately return to the oven and bake for 25 minutes, or until they have quadrupled in volume, are deep golden all over and sound hollow when tapped.

Squeeze out the air then spend a few minutes massaging all the flavours into the meat. Put in the fridge for a few hours or overnight. About 1Â½ hours before you're ready to cook, remove the beef from the fridge and place in a cool corner of the kitchen to come up slowly to room temperature. Preheat your barbecue. Put a few knobs of chilled butter into a bowl of cold water and take those outside with you when you're ready to cook. This next bit is going to be down to you and your intuition. What works for me every time is taking the fillet out of the bag, quickly patting it with kitchen paper then rolling it in olive oil and putting it on the hottest part of the barbecue to give it colour. Rub it with a chilled knob of butter as you cook it for about 8 to 10 minutes, turning every minute.
Once it looks good, move the fillet to a cooler part of the barbecue to finish cooking to your liking. Another 4 to 5 minutes, turning every minute, should give you medium-done meat. If you like it medium rare, cook it for less, or more for well done. It's better to err on the side of under-done. That way, the worst-case scenario is that you take the fillet off, slice into it and find that it's under-cooked, then have to put it back. When you're happy, put it on a platter, rub it again with butter so it really shines, then drizzle over more Worcestershire sauce, extra virgin olive oil, and thyme and rosemary flowers, if you have them. Let the meat rest for a few minutes, before slicing at the table. Season from a height then quickly rub the slices in the juices before you let everyone grab some."

Add all the minced meat, using a wooden spoon to break it up as you go. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for at least 10 minutes, or until all the liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally. Place the coarse grater attachment in your food processor (or you could use a box grater instead) and grate the Cheddar, then tip into a bowl. Replace the grater with the regular blade.

Once the ragÃ¹ is ready, preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Season the ragÃ¹ to taste, then transfer half into freezer bags, portioning up as appropriate for your family. Allow to cool to room temperature, then pop in the freezer for another day. It's a good idea to freeze them flat so that you can reheat them quickly and easily. It's also a good idea to label and date them to avoid a game of freezer roulette in a few weeks' time!, To build your lasagne, spoon a quarter of the ragÃ¹ into a large deep ovenproof dish (roughly 25cm by 30cm) and spread it out evenly. Spoon over a quarter of the white sauce, then snap over some lasagne sheets, making sure they completely cover the sauce in one layer. Repeat this 3 times, finishing with a layer of white sauce. Sprinkle over the remaining cheese and bake the lasagne in the oven for 45 minutes or until golden and bubbling. Remove the lasagne from the oven and leave to sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

Around 1 hour before you start, soak 32 wooden skewers in plenty of cold water. Very finely slice the beef, flatten slightly with the flat side of your knife, then place on a plate. Cover and place in the fridge until needed. To make the marinade, bash the uda pods in a pestle and mortar. Remove and discard the seeds, then place the pods into a liquidiser with the peanuts and spices. Crumble in the stock cube, then blitz for 5 to 10 minutes to a rough powder, stopping and stirring the mixture from time to time. Transfer the ground spices to a large bowl.

Turn the beef in the marinade until well coated, then thread 4 to 5 slices onto each soaked skewer. Place on a tray, cover and pop in the fridge to marinate for around 3 hours. To make the salad, finely slice the tomatoes, then trim and finely shred the cabbage. Peel and finely slice the onion, then finely slice the cucumber. Place into a large bowl with a squeeze of lemon juice, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Preheat a large griddle pan over a medium-high heat. Drizzle the skewers with a little olive oil, then place on the griddle for 1 to 2 minutes, or until beautifully gnarly and golden, turning regularly (you'll need to do this in batches). Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil, then serve with the salad and extra lemon wedges for squeezing over.

Remove from the heat to cool, then finely grate and stir in the Parmesan. Now it's time to assemble your pasta. Following the instructions for making the pasta dough, roll out your dough to 1mm thick, then make your ravioli about 7cm square. I work with a quarter of the pasta at a time to give more control.

Place them on a semolina-dusted tray as you go. Freeze the remaining Bolognese (you'll have roughly half left) for a rainy day, or make a double batch of pasta and freeze as ravioli - you can cook them from frozen in the sauce.

Place a pan on a medium heat, add a lug of oil and the garlic and chilli, and fry for a few minutes, or until very lightly golden.

Place a drip tray inside the middle of the barbecue. Cover with the lid and allow to heat up like an outdoor oven - you want a temperature of around 160°C/320°F. To make your sauce, combine the BBQ sauce and ketchup with a few drops each of Tabasco and chilli sauce, then set aside. Finely dice the onion, pepper and carrot, then put into a large bowl with all the mince, the garlic, bay, Worcestershire sauce, breadcrumbs, salt and pepper. Beat the eggs and add to the mixture, then use your hands to scrunch and mix it all together. Grate in half the cheese (if using), and scrunch to combine. Remove the mixture to a clean work surface and shape into a rectangular loaf (roughly 25cm in length). Using the handle of a wooden spoon, make four diagonal indents (roughly 1cm deep) into the top of the loaf at 3cm intervals, then pour over half the sauce.

Carefully remove the hot tray from the oven and drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then add the butter, rosemary sprigs and garlic, followed by the potatoes. Gently toss to coat, then season with sea salt and roast for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until beautifully golden and crisp. Meanwhile, put your chosen flavoured vinegar ingredients into a small water spritzer and set aside. Make a herb brush by tying the woody herbs to the end of a wooden spoon with string. Put a large ovenproof frying pan on a high heat to get nice and hot. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, season the steak well and add to the pan, fat side down. Leave for a few minutes so the fat renders out. Now sear for around 8 minutes, or until browned all over, turning and basting with the herb brush every minute or so. Transfer the pan to the oven for 15 minutes for medium, or until cooked to your liking, turning halfway. Move the steak to a board, drizzle with the pan juices and leave to rest. A few minutes before the roast potatoes are ready, spritz them with the flavoured vinegar - not too much, you want it to be subtle. Return them to the oven for 30 seconds, then lightly squash them with a fish slice. Spritz again and return to the oven for a final few minutes. Slice up the steak and sprinkle with a little salt. Mix a splash of extra virgin olive oil into the resting juices, then drizzle over the steak. Serve with the vinegary roasties.

To reflect that vibe, I've made this warming, Bloody Mary-spiked beef, which you can leave to tick away for hours while you get on with your day. Served with creamy horseradish mash, this is exactly the fare you'll want when you return home from a cold stroll outdoors. Preheat the oven to 130°C/250°F/gas Â½.

Season the brisket all over with salt and pepper, then add to the hot pan with a splash of olive oil and cook for about 10 minutes, or until gnarly and browned all over. Meanwhile, trim and chop the celery into 5cm chunks, reserving the yellow leaves for later, then peel and quarter the onions. Add the chopped veg to the pan, reduce the heat to low and cook gently for 5 to 10 minutes, or until slightly softened. Combine all of the Bloody Mary ingredients in a large jug, then pour into the pan with 250ml cold water and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Make a bouquet garni by tying the thyme, rosemary and bay together with string, then add to the pan and bring everything to the boil. Take the pan off the heat and cover with a cartouche - this is basically a scrunched-up piece of greaseproof paper that you place directly on the surface of the food. Cover the pan with tin foil and cook in the oven for 5 to 6 hours, or until the beef is tender and falling apart. When there's about 30 minutes to go, peel and slice the potatoes into 2.5cm chunks. Add to a large pan of cold salted water, place over a high heat and bring to the boil, then cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Meanwhile, if using, remove and wash the outer green leaves of the cabbage, then roll them up like a cigar and finely slice. Add the sliced cabbage or curly kale to a pan of boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender, then drain. Drain the potatoes in a colander and leave to steam dry, then return to the pan and mash well with the butter and horseradish. Season to taste, and add a little more horseradish if it needs it. Divide between plates and spoon over the greens, then pull the beef apart with two forks, pile on top and finely grate over a little fresh horseradish.

Although fairly tasty, I wasn't sure it would be the most popular recipe to include in this book, so I made up my own cowboy meatball dish instead. These monster meatballs are so delicious: they're stuffed with cheese and smothered in a rich chilli sauce. I hereby dedicate these balls to all the bulls in the Wild West losing theirs!, Preheat your oven to full whack. Put a large pan on a medium heat and add a good lug of olive oil. Add the 2 diced onions and fry for 10 minutes or until softened, then remove from the heat and leave to cool completely. Put your minced meat into a bowl with the mustard, oregano, cumin, coriander, breadcrumbs, eggs, a good pinch of salt and pepper and the cooled onions. Use clean hands to really scrunch it all together well, then divide the mixture into 8 rounds. Pick each round up, one at a time, and roll into a cricket-sized ball. Stick your thumb deep into the ball to make a pocket, then stuff in a good pinch of grated cheese. Cup, pack and pat the meat around the cheese, using your hands to mould it back into a ball. You'll soon get the hang of it. Place the balls in a large oiled casserole dish or roasting tray, drizzle over a good lug of olive oil, then bang into the oven for 25 to 30 minutes until golden and sizzling. Meanwhile, crack on with your chilli sauce. Use kitchen paper to wipe out the pan you cooked your onions in, and put it back on a medium heat with a few lugs of olive oil. Add the onion, peppers, garlic, fresh chillies and paprika and fry gently for about 15 minutes. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, vinegar, molasses or sugar, mustard, coffee and tomatoes, and bring everything to the boil. Turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. It should be thick and delicious, but if you'd like it a bit thicker just turn the heat up and cook for a few more minutes. Remove the cooked meatballs from the oven when they're ready and spoon away as much of the fat from the pan as you can. Pour your chilli sauce over the top, and return the pan to the oven for 5 more minutes. Finely chop your parsley, sprinkle over, and serve with a spoonful of rice or mash and a lemony green salad. The cowboys I met could easily nail two of these in one sitting, but if you aren't going to be roping cattle all day I'd say one is probably plenty!"

Heat a few lugs of oil in your largest casserole pan on a low heat, add the cumin, paprika, oregano, bay and onions. Fry for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened. Deseed and chop half the fresh chillies. Slice up the rehydrated chillies and add them to the onion mixture along with the chopped fresh chilli, the cinnamon sticks, sliced garlic, a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper and a splash of the chilli-infused coffee.

Add the pieces of brisket and another good pinch of salt and pepper, cover with a lid and simmer for around 3 hours, stirring occasionally. After a few hours use 2 forks or a potato masher to break the meat up and pull it apart. Once you've done this, deseed, slice and add the peppers, then drain and add the beans. Leave to simmer with the lid off for 30 minutes, or until the meat is completely falling apart and delicious, stirring occasionally. Have a taste and season well - if you require a bit more heat (like I would), this is the time to deseed and chop the rest of the fresh chilli and stir it in. Dollop a big spoonful of soured cream over the chilli (if using), and serve straight from the pan, with fluffy rice, flatbreads or potatoes and a really nice fresh lemony green salad.

Put the shavings into iced or very cold water for about a minute - this gives you a lovely crispy texture but the downside is that you lose flavour, so be quick. As soon as the fennel starts to curl up, drain it in a colander, remove any ice cubes, spin it
really dry in a salad spinner and put to one side. Whip up the eggs with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Add a splash of water to the mixture as this will give you thin crÃªpe-like omelettes. Rub a little olive oil over the bottom of a 20cm non-stick frying pan and place it on the heat. Working quickly, pour in a little egg mixture and tilt the pan so it runs all round the bottom. In less than a minute your crÃªpe will be opaque and cooked through. Touch it lightly to test whether it's done. If it is, hold the pan at an angle and start to peel it away with a spatula. Be gentle and don't rush - if you mess the first one up, don't worry, you'll get the feel for it! When you've made your crÃªpes, stack them on a board and cover them with tin foil to keep them warm. Put the fennel and all the salad leaves into a bowl. Divide the bresaola between four plates and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil. Remove the tinfoil from the crÃªpes. Roll them up one at a time and slice them 1 to 2cm wide. Toss them gently with your fingers to unwind them. Add them to the bowl of fennel and salad leaves with the grated Parmesan. Dress with 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper and toss gently but thoroughly. Taste and balance with seasoning and a little extra lemon juice if need be. For a cool tweak, add a teaspoon of truffle oil. Sprinkle the reserved herby fennel tops over the salad.

Put a very large casserole-type pan (roughly 25cm in diameter) on a medium heat, add a good lug of olive oil, then add the allspice, pepper, ground cloves, a good pinch of salt, and grate in the nutmeg. Stir for a few minutes, until it's smelling fantastic, then tip in everything from the food processor and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until the veg are starting to soften. Cut the steak into roughly 2cm pieces and pulse in a food processor until it looks like mince. Add to the pan of veg, then do the same with the lamb or mutton and the heart. Get rid of any sinewy bits. Halve the kidneys, and quickly rinse them and the livers in a bowl of water. Drain, then pulse in the processor once or twice - don't purée them! Add to the pan, then cook and stir everything for about 15 minutes, or until the meat starts to colour. At this point, add the bay leaves and 500ml of stock or water, then cover with a lid and leave to blip away on a low heat for around 2 hours, stirring now and then to make sure it doesn't catch and adding a splash of water if needed. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. After 2 hours, spoon a few ladles of the haggis mixture (avoiding the bay leaves) into the clean food processor and blitz to a fairly smooth consistency. Stir this back in to add a lovely creaminess. Spread the pinhead oats on a baking tray and toast in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until golden. Stir into the haggis mixture, then add the remaining stock. Simmer with the lid off for about another 30 to 35 minutes. This is a great time to cook your neeps and tatties. Once the time is up, fish out the bay leaves and continue cooking until you've got a nice thick consistency. Turn the heat off, then correct the seasoning to push it to the point of perfection. Stir in the whisky, a few gratings of lemon and orange zest and the Worcestershire sauce. Taste and correct the flavours if needed, then put the lid on and leave until you're ready to serve - preferably with plenty of good friends and a dram or two of fine Scottish whisky. PS: Put the leftover haggis into an earthenware-type dish and top it off with neeps and tatties. It makes the most exciting sorta-shepherd's pie."

What's amazing for me is that thousands of miles away in Britain we were hunting deer for venison and stewing that with juniper too. I guess some combos are just brilliant, no matter where you live. Don't worry if you can't get venison, because stewing beef will also be delicious. Really nice served with some rice, beans, a jacket potato or flatbreads, or, if you're a bit more traditional, some nice steamed greens. A humble but delicious stew. Dust a chopping board with 2 tablespoons of flour and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and toss your chunks of meat through this mixture until well coated. Heat a large pan on a high heat, add a few lugs of olive oil and fry your meat for 3 minutes to brown it. Add your chopped onions, carrots, celery, crushed juniper berries, rosemary and the knob of butter. Add a few tablespoons of water, give everything a good stir, then pop the lid on the pan and let everything steam for 4 to 5 minutes so the flavours really mingle together. Take the lid off so your meat and veg start to fry, and stir every so often for 5 to 10 minutes. Chop your parsley stalks finely, and once the onions start to caramelize, add them to the pan with your remaining 2 tablespoons of flour and your crumbled stock cubes. Stir, and pour in enough water to cover the mixture by a couple of inches. Put the parsley leaves aside for later. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to medium low so that the stew is just simmering. Add your potatoes and slow cook for at least 2 hours with the lid slightly askew, or until the meat falls apart easily. Keep an eye on it as it cooks, and add splashes of water if you think it looks too dry. Put your chopped garlic in the middle of a chopping board. Add most of your parsley leaves with a teaspoon of sea salt and half a teaspoon of black pepper. Chop everything together so you get a kinda chunky paste. Add this to the stew and stir through. Chop the last of your parsley leaves and sprinkle over before serving."

Delicious served with an Everyday chopped green salad or some Brilliant broccoli. Jamie's top tips
â€¢ Look out for ground beef with around 10% fat - if buying turkey, try to buy the best quality you can afford. Don't buy poor-quality turkey mince. If your grocery store has a meat counter you can ask them to grind the meat for you.
â€¢ This can be made completely ahead of time and reheated just before serving. If you're reheating Sloppy Joes, add water a little bit at a time to loosen.
â€¢ If you want to give it a bit of a kick add some more chile powder or even a chopped fresh chile. Tips from the dietitian:
â€¢ Sloppy Joe is a real favorite, but for a healthier version, use lean ground turkey instead of beef - the leaner meat is better for the heart.
â€¢ Rinsing beans removes some of the salt but you can also look for low-sodium or no-salt-added beans."

Halve the squash and scoop out the seeds. Pick through them and save a small handful, discarding the rest and picking off all the fleshy pulp. Add them to a small pan with a lug of olive oil and fry until golden. Keep to one side. In a pestle and mortar, bash the fennel and coriander seeds and dried chilli flakes with 1 teaspoon of sea salt and a pinch of black pepper until fine. Cut the squash halves into wedges and add to a roasting tray. Tip over the spices, then scatter over the cinnamon. Crumble the chestnuts directly into the tray, then drizzle lightly with olive oil. Toss to coat. Roast in the oven to cook for 30 to 45 minutes, or until beautiful, golden, and soft when you pinch it. When the squash is done, sprinkle over a little salt from a height and carefully tip the golden seeds into the tray, leaving the oil behind in the pan. Pick the rosemary leaves onto a board with a good pinch of salt and pepper and finely chop it all together. Roll the beef about on the board until it's well coated in the rosemary. Return the pan of oil to a high heat, and once its screaming hot, add the beef. Sear it for 1 to 1Â½ minutes, so it browns, then turn it over and do the same on the other side. Remember you're just searing it to get a bit of colour on the outside, not cooking it - it should be blue in the middle. Meanwhile, make the dressing. Add the mustard, 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice to a bowl or mortar and mix well. Have a little taste and check the seasoning then put aside. With a really sharp knife, slice the beef up as thinly as you can without hacking it up or ruining it! Go thicker to do it nicely if you need to. Use the back of a knife to carefully flatten out each slice of beef, then transfer them to a large platter. Sprinkle with a little salt, as the seasoning won't have got through to the centre of the beef. Arrange the squash pieces over the top, then crumble over the roasted chestnuts and scatter over the seeds. Drizzle everything with a bit dressing (save any leftovers for another day), then lightly dress the salad leaves and pop these on the top. Take it to the table with a block of Parmesan for shaving over."

Carpaccio is usually served raw, but I'm searing the beef to give it a bit of colour. You'll be able to pick up these ingredients from most good supermarkets but if you can, get yourself down to a specialist Japanese store and pick up a sachet of authentic Japanese spices - use a tablespoon of that instead of the spice mix. Cut your beef fillet in half lengthways then roll each piece tightly in cling film. Pop in the fridge overnight to firm it up and make it easy to cut. The next day, cook your rice according to packet instructions. When you're ready to cook the beef put a large frying pan on a high heat. Put all of the spice mix ingredients in a pestle and mortar and lightly crush them. Unwrap the pieces of beef, sprinkle them with the crushed spices and pat them down to help them stick. Add a splash of groundnut oil to the pan and sear the beef for 1 minute, turning with tongs until golden on all sides - don't forget the ends! Transfer it to a board to rest for a few minutes. Meanwhile, mix the tahini, soy, vinegar, icing sugar, a squeeze of lime juice and 1 tablespoon of water in a bowl. Spoon the sticky rice onto a serving board and scatter with the seaweed, if using, and the toasted sesame seeds. Drizzle the sauce on the side. Slice the pieces of beef as finely as you can and lay the slices slightly overlapping on the board. Snip the cress on the side and serve with lime wedges for squeezing over."

If you prefer it medium-rare, take it out 5 to 10 minutes earlier. For well done, leave it in for another 10 to 15 minutes. If you're doing roast potatoes and veggies, this is the time to crack on with them - get them into the oven for the last 45 minutes of cooking. Baste the beef halfway through cooking and if the veg look dry, add a splash of water to the tray to stop them from burning. When the beef is cooked to your liking, take the tray out of the oven and transfer the beef to a board to rest for 15 minutes or so.

You're not adding anything to the meat so make sure you work it well to create lovely patty shapes. Ask your butcher to mince the steak for you or just pulse it a few times in a food processor. Put a pan on a high heat and add a lug of olive oil. Once hot, add the onion, turn the heat down to low and cook, stirring often, for 30 to 40 minutes, or until soft and sticky. To make the flavoured mayo, simply empty the mayo into a bowl and whisk with the gentleman's relish. Have a taste and add a squeeze or two of lemon juice. Put a griddle pan or large frying pan on a high heat to get nice and hot. Divide the minced steak into 4 portions, then pat and shape each portion into a burger patty, about 2cm thick. Drizzle the burgers with a little olive oil then add to the hot griddle or frying pan. Turn the heat down to medium and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until nicely charred. Sprinkle them with a pinch of salt and pepper, then turn them over and use the thyme as a brush to coat the burgers with a little mustard. Lay a slice of cheese on each burger so it starts to melt. Cook for another 6 to 8 minutes. These timings will give you blushing burgers, but cook yours for a little longer if you prefer. Meanwhile, put a large frying pan on a high heat and add your bacon. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Transfer it to a plate and carefully wipe the pan clean with a ball of kitchen paper. Toast the buns in the hot pan - you'll need to do this in 2 batches. Layer up the cheese burgers in the toasted buns with a dollop of flavoured mayo, the bacon and sticky onions.

Add the tomato purée, stout, flour and stock and stir until everything comes together to a simmer. Turn the heat down very low, pop the lid on and let it cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. When the hour is up, stir in the pearl barley. Put the lid back on and simmer for another hour, then remove the lid and simmer for a further 30 minutes, or until the meat shreds easily and the gravy is thick. Spoon away any oil from the top, then stir in the mustard and Worcestershire sauce and finely grate in the cheese. Season to taste. While the stew is ticking away, put the flour, suet and butter into a bowl with a good pinch of salt. Use your thumbs and forefingers to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles cornflake shapes. Lightly stir in 125ml of cold water, then use your hands to gently pat and push it together into a rough dough. Do not overwork it. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and put into the fridge until needed. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Discard the shin bone and ladle the hot meaty stew into the pie dish (24 x 30cm, and about 4cm deep, is about right). Beat the egg, then use a little to eggwash the edges of the pie dish, then dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour and roll out the pastry about 1cm thick and a little bit bigger than your pie dish. Carefully place on top of the pie, then trim off any overhanging pastry. Pinch and squash the edges of the pastry to the dish.

Bring to the boil, place a lid on top, then place in the oven until the meat is tender - sometimes this takes 3 hours, sometimes 4 - it depends on what cut of meat you're using and how fresh it is. The only way to test is to mash up a piece of meat and if it falls apart easily it's ready. Once cooked, turn the oven down to about 110°C/225°F/gas Â¼ and just hold it there until you're ready to eat. The best way to serve this is by ladling big spoonfuls into bowls, accompanied by a glass of French red wine and some really fresh, warmed bread. Finely grate the lemon zest, pick and finely chop the rosemary and peel and finely chop the garlic, then mix together and sprinkle over the stew before serving.

Obviously the better the beef the better the dish. So go for something with good marbling and a bit of integrity. It can be served on a sharing platter with different salads sprinkled on top. The truffle oil's optional, but the flavour is interesting, so give it a try because it's something new. This whole dish is impressive and damn tasty. OK, first things first - whack your oven on to its highest heat. For this dish we're going to cook the meat on the platter it will be served on, so ideally use one of those classic cheap old metal flats or trays. Or you can use regular serving plates instead, if you know they're heatproof. Rub them with extra virgin olive oil or truffle oil. And now you're going to prepare the meat. Work with one piece at a time, and put it on a 30cm piece of bin-liner with another piece on top. Using a rolling pin, evenly slap the meat until it's 4 times the width you started with, but a quarter of the thickness. Lay the meat on your tray, platter or plate right to the edges - you can let it hang over a tiny bit. Put your rosemary leaves into a sieve and run hot water over them to get the oils and flavours going. Put them into a little bowl, pour 3 or 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil on top and massage the leaves with your fingers to get more flavour out of them. Stir the garlic into the rosemary oil, then pat everything evenly all over the meat. The meat can be prepared to this point a few hours in advance, then cling-filmed and kept in the fridge. Now all you've got to do is get a little salad together. Tear your rocket and radicchio into a large bowl. Slice your mushrooms as thinly as possible and add them to the bowl. This dish is best put together really quickly at the last minute. All you need to do is put the meat in the preheated oven for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your oven). By the time you've dressed the salad, with a little extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper, and put your block of Parmesan on the table with a speed peeler for shaving pieces off it, you can take the meat out of the oven - it should be paler in colour now. The idea is not to cook the meat, it's simply to warm it through. Scatter the salad over and serve it straight away. Shave over some Parmesan and have a nice glass of wine with it.

Shape into four patties and refrigerate for half an hour or so to give them a chance to firm up slightly. When you're ready to cook the burgers, get a frying or griddle pan nice and hot.  Brush the pan with a little oil, season the burgers generously with salt and pepper, and cook them for 10 minutes, turning them carefully every minute or so, until they're nice and pink and juicy, or longer if you like them well done. Make sure they don't break up as you turn them. Meanwhile, roughly chop the lettuce, tomato and cucumber, mix together and set aside.

Fry for 10 minutes or until the onions have softened, then put to one side to cool completely. Blitz your crackers or bread (remove the crusts first) in a food processor until you get a fine consistency. Oil a clean baking tray and put aside. Put the cooled onions into a large bowl with the rest of the burger ingredients. Use clean hands to scrunch the mixture together really well, then divide into 6 equal balls for burgers and 18 equal balls for sliders. Wet your hands and roll the balls into burger-shaped patties about 2cm thick. Place your burgers or sliders on the oiled baking tray and pat with a little olive oil. Cover them with clingfilm and put the tray into the fridge for at least an hour, or until the patties firm up. This is a good time to make your spicy mayo, so put mayo, yoghurt, ketchup and smoked paprika into a bowl, squeeze in the lemon juice, mix well and put to one side. If using a frying pan or griddle pan, put it on a high heat now and let it get really hot. However you decide to cook your burgers, they'll want around 3 or 4 minutes per side - you may have to cook them in batches if your pan isn't big enough. When your burgers or sliders are nearly cooked on one side, add the rashers of bacon - whichever way you're cooking them - then flip the burgers and cook the bacon until golden and crisp. When the burgers are cooked to your liking and it's all looking really good, halve your burger buns and warm them through. Put the bacon on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain.

Finely chop the garlic, capers, gherkins, anchovies and herbs and put them into a bowl. Add the mustard and vinegar, then slowly stir in the olive oil until you achieve the right consistency. Balance the flavours with freshly ground black pepper, a bit of salt and maybe a little more vinegar. Tie up the stalk ends of your bunch of thyme, place the leafy ends in a pestle and mortar and give it a good bash. This will remove the tasty leaves and leave you with what looks like a miniature broom. Put this to one side. Add your garlic, anchovy fillet and lemon zest to the mortar. Bash to a paste and stir in your olive oil. Your fillet steaks should be about 2.5cm thick. Wrap a piece of bacon around each steak (this gives them a really good flavour) and secure loosely with a piece of string. Peel the mushroom skins off, which only takes a second and helps them absorb the marinade. Brush the steaks and mushrooms with some of your flavoured thyme oil, keeping the rest for the cooking. Try to become instinctive about cooking basic things like steaks and to understand heat, sizes and cuts of meat. Chefs test their meat by the way it looks and the resistance it gives when squeezed. Preheat your griddle pan or barbecue until really hot. I don't want to give you a specific time to cook them, as your steaks may be thicker or thinner than the ones I'm using. Whether using fillets or sirloins, I cook mine for roughly 3 or 4 minutes each side and let them rest for a couple of minutes to give me a medium-cooked steak - you can do them for a little more or less time to your preference. Season the meat on both sides and place on the griddle pan with your mushrooms. Turn every minute, and brush each time with your thyme oil brush. The mushrooms will be cooked after about 6 minutes and should be soft to the touch - cooking them this way means they don't go all soggy but they do have an intense meaty flavour. Once the beef is cooked to your liking, remove the string, divide the steaks between 4 warmed plates with your mushrooms, allow to rest for 2 minutes and put a big dollop of salsa verde over the top."

At this stage, remove the lid and check the consistency.

I like mine Italian-style, with the meat sliced a little more thickly. This makes it a bit more rustic and you can really taste the quality of the meat. I also like to sear the meat very quickly before slicing it up, as this gives you a contrasting encrusted edge of flavour. It's lovely with this marinated bean salad - you can simply use green beans, or a mixture of different ones. You don't need loads of meat for this, just a couple of slices per person, which should allow you to spend a little more on a good-quality piece of beef. Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Drop in the beans and cook for about 5 minutes. When perfectly done, drain them in a colander. To make the marinade, mix the chopped shallot or onion in a bowl with the herbs, mustard, vinegar and 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then add the hot cooked beans and toss. Put to one side to allow the beans to cool down and take on all the fantastic flavours. Place the beef fillet on a chopping board and season it all over with salt and pepper. Run the thyme sprigs under hot water for a few seconds - this will help to release their fragrant oils. Strip the leaves from the stalks and chop them up roughly. Sprinkle the thyme over the fillet, then roll the meat around the chopping board so that any excess seasoning and herbs stick to it. Get a heavy frying pan very hot and add a splash of oil, followed by the beef fillet. Fry for 1 minute only, turning it every few seconds to sear and encrust all the lovely flavourings on to it. Take the meat out of the frying pan and put it on to a plate to rest for a minute. (Once seared, you can serve straight away or you can keep the meat covered on a plate until needed. I prefer not to keep it in the fridge.), Slice the seared fillet with a sharp knife. Lay each slice on a board and flatten as much as you can by pressing down on them with the side of a chopping knife - it works a treat. Lay two or three slices out flat on each plate. Season again lightly and place a pile of beans on top, spooning over some of the marinade. Sprinkle over any leftover herb leaves and drizzle with some good extra virgin olive oil."

You do need to plan ahead, as the flavours need about two days to sink into the salmon properly, but it's worth the wait. You'll only spend about 20 minutes doing the actual curing, and you'll end up with a delicate pink gravadlax which tastes impressive. Although curing is easy, it is important to follow the measurements, so try to get a side of salmon as close as possible to the weight I've suggested here. 
For the first cure, blitz the beetroots, orange and lemon zest, and bashed juniper berries in a food processor until you get a fairly smooth paste. Transfer this to a bowl and stir in the rock salt and sugar. Pour in the gin and give it a good mix. Lay the side of salmon skin-side down on a large baking tray and slowly pour over the beetroot cure. Use a spatula to spread it all over the salmon flesh. Once it is all well covered, wrap the salmon in a double layer of greaseproof paper then wrap it tightly with cling film and place it in the fridge for 24 hours. The next day, take the salmon out of the fridge and carefully unwrap it so you can rinse off the cure. Either use 100ml of cold water or gin. Hold the salmon over a baking tray and pour a splash at a time over your salmon. Use a spoon to gently push the beetroot cure off the fish. By now it should have shared its wonderful flavours with the fish and turned it a really vibrant colour. Put the rinsed salmon to one side and run the tray under the tap. For the second cure, mix together the chopped herbs, grated horseradish and gin. Put the salmon back into the clean tray, skin-side down, and pack the herby cure onto the salmon using your hands. Make sure you cover all the flesh - you don't want any air getting to it. Wrap it again with a double layer of greaseproof paper, then a tight layer of cling film. Pop the salmon back in the fridge for another 24 hours. The next day your salmon will be perfectly cured and ready to eat. You don't need to rinse off that second cure - simply slice the salmon as finely as you can on an angle so you get gorgeous thin slices of gravadlax tinged with pink and topped with herbs. Pile these onto a plate and serve with a couple of slices of buttered brown bread, and some watercress and wedges of lemon."

Peel your beetroots then coarsely grate them into a bowl. Add the ginger, egg yolks, honey and olive oil in a bowl and add the seeds from 1 vanilla pod. Whisk together, then add the baking powder, polenta, orange zest and juice, salt, allspice, cinnamon and flour. In a separate bowl beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them into the beetroot mixture. Get yourself a 25cm cake tin or cheesecake mould. Rub with butter and dust with a little flour to stop the cake sticking. You could also line it with greaseproof paper to be really sure. Pour in the mixture then bake in the preheated oven for around 35 minutes until spongy.

The best advice I can give you is about flavouring them. A few smashed garlic cloves, a woody herb like rosemary, thyme, sage or bay, and a splash of vinegar, or squeezed lemon or orange juice, can accentuate their natural flavour. Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Put your carrots into a large pot and your beets into another, and add enough water to cover them. Season with salt and bring to the boil. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes until just tender, then drain and place in separate bowls. Peel your beets, and cut any larger carrots and beets in half or into quarters. Smaller ones can stay whole. Now add your flavourings while the veg are still hot. Toss the carrots with half the smashed garlic and a lug of olive oil, then lightly season. Add the orange juice and the thyme leaves and toss again. Mix the beets with the rest of the garlic, the rosemary, balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper. You can now put the veg either into separate ovenproof dishes, or together on a large roasting tray with the carrots in one half of the tray and the beets in the other. Place in middle of the preheated oven and roast for around half an hour or until golden. While the carrots and beets are cooking, lay the pork chops on a board and score through the skin and the streaky-looking part of the meat. This will give you lovely crackling. Look at the picture - you'll see what I mean. Firmly press a sage leaf on to the eye meat on both sides of each chop. Season with salt and pepper. When the vegetables start to colour, heat a large ovenproof frying pan or small roasting tray on the hob, add a good lug of olive oil and put in the chops. As soon as you've got nice colour on one side, turn the chops over and place the tray in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the chops are crisp on the outside and just cooked through and juicy in the middle. Remove the chops to a warmed plate. Pour most of the fat away from the tray and add a squeeze of lemon juice to it. Stir and scrape the lovely sticky bits off the bottom and drizzle all over the chops. Remove the carrots and beets from the oven - they should be nice and sticky by now. Serve them with the chops and a glass of wine."

You can get some great beetroots these days - fantastic colours. I took the leaves off the beetroots and threw them away, as I didn't need them for this salad (although it's worth remembering that they're edible and that they taste nicer than Swiss chard or spinach!). I washed the beetroots and then, using a speed peeler, I peeled them all down into really thin slices and flavoured them with salt, pepper, chopped flat-leaf parsley and a little grated fresh horseradish to give a nice bit of heat. Then I left them for 5 to 10 minutes so that the acid from the horseradish would soften the beetroot. The horseradish is optional, but it gives a good twang.

You want a warm, draught-free place for the quickest prove, for example near the cooker, in the airing cupboard, in the plate warmer of a cooker or just in a warm room, and you can cover it with a clean damp tea towel. This proving process matures the flour flavour and should take approximately 40 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, depending on the conditions. Right, it's double the size and time to knock it back. Knead and punch the dough, knocking all the air out of it, for about a minute. Shape the dough into whatever shape you want - round, flat, filled, or whatever - and leave to prove a second time in a warm place until the dough is double its size. Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Now it's time to cook your loaf. After all your hard work, don't spoil your efforts. You want to keep the air inside the loaf, so don't knock it, put it very gently into the oven and don't slam the door. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it's cooked. You can tell if it's cooked by tapping its bottom (if it's in a tin you'll have to take it out) - if it sounds hollow it's cooked; if it doesn't, pop it back in for a little longer. Place the bread on a wire rack to cool. You're going to love this bread!"

Gradually pour in 500ml of tepid water and pulse for a few minutes until you have a ball of dough. Leave the lid on and prove in a warm place for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until doubled in size. Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper and dust with flour. Lightly draw the outline of a Christmas tree in the flour with your finger. Remove the box base from one Camembert and place it in the centre of the tray. Divide the dough into three pieces, then each of those into 12, giving you 36 in total. One-by-one roll each piece into a ball and place on the tray, building out from the Camembert box to create your tree shape. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove for another hour. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Cut the rind off the top of each Camembert leaving a 1cm rim (reserving the boxes for baking). Pick the tips off three rosemary sprigs and poke into the soft cheeses, then peel and finely slice the garlic, drizzle with olive oil and poke those in too. Sprinkle each cheese with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then pop one in its box in the centre of the tree, and another on a separate tray. Reserve the third cheese for later. Strip the remaining rosemary leaves and dot between the dough balls. Sprinkle with a good pinch of salt from a height, and drizzle with olive oil. Place the bread tree in the oven with the second cheese on the shelf below and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the Camemberts are gooey and the bread is risen and golden. As soon as you serve the first two cheeses, bake the third one in its box for about 20 minutes, then swap with the eaten ones. Delicious."

Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat. Next, pour in 1Â½ tablespoons of oil and 350ml water into the well and add most of the beaten egg (saving a little for egg washing later). Mix with a fork, then bring together with your hands to form a ball. On a lightly dusted surface, knead the dough for 10 minutes until smooth and springy. Be careful not to add too much flour here to prevent the dough drying out. Place in a large oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. To braid your challah, divide the dough into two balls. Put one aside covered with a damp tea towel and cut the other ball into 4 even pieces.  Roll each piece into a thin sausage-shape, roughly 60cm long. Place two of the strands next to each other vertically. Weave the remaining two strands horizontally over and under the vertical strands to form a cross shape. Working with the top pair of strands, take the strand that is underneath and place over the strand next to it. Do the same with the next pair of strands and continue this around the cross. Once all four pairs have been crossed over, do the same in the reverse direction - clockwise/anti-clockwise depending on your strands. The rule to go by is to always place the underneath strand over its pair. Continue this process until you have used up the dough. As you start to run out of dough tuck the ends under the loaf to form a neat braided ball. Place on a lined baking tray. Repeat the braiding technique with your second ball of dough. Cover both loaves loosely with a damp tea towel and leave to rise for a further 30 minutes. Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Use the remaining egg to glaze the challah. Sprinkle over the sesame seeds and bake for 40 minutes, or until golden. Adding extra egg wash halfway, if needed."

Combine the levain ingredients in a bowl with 80g of water and beat until smooth. Cover with clingfilm and leave overnight, at room temperature, until the mixture is bubbly. The next morning, combine the strong white flour and rye or spelt flour in a large bowl, and make a well in the centre. Add the levain and 300ml of cool water. Mix with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon for a couple of minutes until thoroughly combined and no lumps remain. Cover and set aside for 20 to 30 minutes to let the flour absorb the water and become hydrated. Grind 15g sea salt in a pestle and mortar and add to the dough. Using wet hands, mix to combine, then turn out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10 minutes using the â€˜slap and fold' technique: pick up the dough in both hands, flip it and slap it onto the work surface, letting the full weight of it drop - the dough will stick to the surface. Working quickly, pull and stretch the dough from the far end towards you, then fold it in half away from you. Pick up the dough again, turn it anti-clockwise, and repeat. Continue this action for 10 to 15 minutes - the dough will be silky smooth, elastic and no longer sticky. Do not be tempted to add more flour during the kneading process. With the help of the bench scraper, scoop the dough up and return it to the bowl, rounded-side-up. Cover loosely with clingfilm or a shower cap and leave at room temperature, in a draught-free spot, for about 1 hour, or until the dough looks smooth and airy but has not risen significantly. Lightly dust your hands and work surface with flour. Turn out the dough, gently press and stretch it into a rectangle three times as long as it is wide, about 12cm x 40cm. With a shorter side closest to you, fold the lower third into the middle, then fold the upper third over the top, giving you a triple-layered square of dough. Rotate it 90 degrees, stretch it out into a rectangle again and repeat the folding steps once more. Flip the square of dough over, place it back in the bowl and cover loosely with clingfilm or a shower cap. Leave to prove at room temperature for 4 hours. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Pull the top edge into the centre, turn the dough a quarter of a turn and repeat - do this 5 or 6 times until it becomes smooth. Flip it over, cover with an upturned bowl and set aside for 10 to 15 minutes. Place the rice flour in a bowl with an extra tablespoon of strong flour. Line a banneton or proving basket with a clean linen towel and dust with the flour mixture - this ensures that the dough won't stick to the sides of the basket. Use the palms of your hands to shape the dough into a tight round, seam-side down. Twist the dough anti-clockwise, without lifting it or knocking out any air - you want to keep the ball neat and tight. Dust with flour and use the bench scraper to lift and turn it over. Place in the basket, seam-side-up, cover with a shower cap and leave to prove at room temperature for 4 hours, by which time it will have risen by nearly half again. Place the basket of dough in the fridge overnight to prove. The next morning, the dough should be almost to the top of the basket and, when pressed with the tip of your finger, will slowly bounce back, leaving a small indent. Preheat the oven to 240°C/475°F/gas 9 and place a cloche baking dome, Dutch oven or large, lidded cast-iron casserole dish inside. Leave the oven to heat up for 30 minutes or so. Remove the dough from the fridge, dust with semolina or polenta and carefully turn out the loaf into the cloche or casserole. Working quickly, use a lame to slash a pattern into the top of the loaf. Cover with the lid and bake for 40 minutes, then remove the cover, reduce the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7 and bake for another 20 minutes. Leave to cool on a wire rack."

Leave it to one side to activate, when the surface will become foamy. Peel and finely chop the shallot. In a pan, heat the molasses, butter, coffee and chocolate with 500ml of water until the chocolate and butter have melted, then add the vinegar. For this step you can either use an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, or make the bread by hand. In your mixer or bowl, stir together all three flours, then scoop out about a third into a separate bowl and set aside. Mix the bran into your main flour, along with the caraway seeds, fennel seeds, 2 tablespoons of sea salt and shallot, then pour in the chocolate and yeast mixtures. If you're using a mixer, putÂ it on medium speed and mix together until lovely and smooth, around 3 to 5 minutes, or beat it with a wooden spoon, although it'll take a little longer by hand. Reduce the speed and add the remaining mixed flour a little at a time until it comes together in a dough. It should feel a little sticky, but firm and dense. You might not need all the flour. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it well, so it becomes springy and elastic. Mould the dough into a ball with your hands. Lightly grease a clean mixing bowl and the dough ball with the olive oil. Pop the dough ball into the bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place for 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size. Now knock the dough back by turning it out onto a lightly floured surface and kneading for a couple of minutes. Cut the dough in two and form each half into a round loaf. Place them on a lightly greased baking tray, seam-side down, cover with a damp tea towel, and leave to rise again for about an hour. Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4. Slice a cross into the top of each loaf and place in the oven for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until browned on top  and cooked through - they'll sound hollow when knocked on the bottom.

Crack in the eggs, add the Marmite (if using - simply leave it out for a gluten-free friendly loaf) and beat together, then pour in the yeast mixture. Whisking as you go, gradually bring in the flour from the outside until combined - it'll be more like a batter than a dough. Pour into the prepared tin and smooth out nice and evenly on top. Now you've got two choices - bake it straight away and it'll puff up a bit more and taste fantastic, or cover and place it in the fridge overnight and allow some slightly more complex sour flavours to develop. Both are brilliant, just different. To bake, place in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden, cooked through and an inserted skewer comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for at least 20 minutes before eating, then serve. This bread is good fresh for a couple of days, and delicious toasted for a few days after that.

In the bowl of a free-standing mixer, combine the salt, sugar, yeast, 6 eggs, both flours and 85ml of tepid water. Using the dough-hook attachment, mix on a slow speed until all the ingredients are combined; this should take about 3 minutes. Increase the mixer speed to just over halfway and mix until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl. Turn off the mixer and leave the mixture to rest for 5 minutes. Turn the mixer back on and slowly add the butter, a little nugget at a time, until all of it is incorporated. Add a little more flour if the dough feels too sticky - it should come away easily from the sides of the bowl. Place the dough in a separate, lightly oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to prove at room temperature until doubled in size, about 40 minutes. Once it's proved, knock back the dough by folding it onto itself. Cover and place in the fridge for 4 hours. Next, make your shortbread. Cream the butter, sugar and vanilla until smooth and fluffy. Mix in the flour, until it comes together into a dough. Place between two sheets of greaseproof paper and roll it out to the thickness of a Â£1 coin. Using star-shaped cutters (or any shape you like), cut out 24 biscuits. Chill on a lined baking tray in the fridge for at least 10 minutes, until ready to bake. Preheat the oven to 160°C/gas 2-3, then bake the shortbread for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden. Sprinkle with caster sugar, then set aside. To make your crÃ¨me pÃ¢tissiÃ¨re, place the milk, cream and cinnamon into a pan over a medium heat. While that's heating, whisk the eggs, sugar and cornflour in a bowl. Once the cream mixture has almost come to a boil, take it off the heat. Slowly pour a third of it into the eggs, whisking constantly - this step will gently bring up the temperature of the eggs without scrambling them. Pour the mixture back into the rest of the cream mixture and whisk well. Place the pan back over the heat and whisk the mixture constantly until it starts to boil - this will take about 2 to 3 minutes. Pour into a clean bowl and place a sheet of clingfilm on the surface of your crÃ¨me pat, to stop a skin from forming. Leave the bowl in the fridge until needed. Once the brioche has chilled for 4 hours, divide into 40 to 50g balls, roughly the size of golf balls, and place on a baking tray lined with baking paper. Cover loosely with clingfilm and leave to prove again until doubled in size, about 25 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4. In a bowl, combine all of the crumble ingredients and rub together with your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Set aside. With lightly floured hands, poke an indent in the centre of each ball, then lift each one and gently pull the sides away to make a doughnut shape, being careful not to knock out too much air. Place the brioches on the baking sheet. Use two fingers to gently increase each indent into a crater 3 to 4cm wide. Working quickly, place a teaspoonful of crÃ¨me pÃ¢tissiÃ¨re into the centre, topped with a couple of teaspoons of mincemeat. Beat the remaining eggs together, then glaze the outside of the pies with egg wash, and top generously with the crumble mixture. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown, then remove from the oven and leave to cool. Press the shortbread shapes on top of your mince pies, and serve."

Brush the chilled tin with melted butter, ensuring every little groove is coated. Dust with 1 tablespoon of the flour and tap out the excess. Finely chop the candied peel, then place in a small saucepan with the raisins. Add the brandy and orange blossom water (if using), then set it over a low heat until warm, but do not let it boil. Remove from the heat, stir well and set aside until the fruit has soaked up all of the liquid. Meanwhile, to make your dough, tip the yeast into the bowl of a free-standing mixer. Remove the seeds from the cardamom pods, then grind to a powder in a pestle and mortar (roughly Â¼ of a teaspoon). In a pan, heat the milk until just warm and add to the yeast with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Whisk well to combine, then leave for about 10 minutes, until the yeast has formed a thick, foamy crust on top of the milk. Add the remaining sugar, plain flour, ground cardamom, cinnamon and a grating of nutmeg, and Â½ teaspoon of sea salt. Whisk the buttermilk with the whole eggs and egg yolk, finely grate in the lemon zest and add the vanilla, then add to the bowl. Add the butter, then, using the dough hook, start mixing the dough on a slow speed until combined. Continue to mix for a further 3 to 4 minutes until silky smooth. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size. Scatter the whole almonds into the bottom of the prepared tin. Tip the soaked fruit into the dough and mix again until combined. Spoon the dough evenly into the tin over the nuts, spread level, cover with clingfilm and leave to rise again until almost doubled in size; this will take 45 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 170°C/gas 3 and position the rack in the bottom third. Bake the kugelhopf for 45 to 50 minutes until golden brown, well risen and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean.

Cover with another layer of bread, scatter with more dried fruit, then cover with the remaining bread. Set aside, reserving the remaining dried fruit for later. To make the custard, halve the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape out the seeds. Add the seeds to a medium pan with the remaining custard ingredients and 400ml of water. Whisk well until smooth and combined, then place over a medium-low heat. Simmer gently for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the custard is almost boiling and coats the back of a wooden spoon, whisking continuously. Pour the custard over the bread then scatter the remaining dried fruit on top. Leave to soak for around 20 minutes, then place in the hot oven for 25 to 35 minutes, or until lightly golden and starting to set. Meanwhile, gently warm the marmalade in a pan over a low heat. Once the pudding is ready, brush over the warm marmalade, then return to the oven for a further 5 minutes, or until golden and sticky. Allow to cool slightly, then tuck in."

Form into a ball, place in a lightly oiled bowl and leave to rise for 1 to 1Â½ hours, until doubled in size. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knock it back by kneading lightly. Divide into 4 and roll each piece into a long sausage. Cut each one in half, then each half into thirds, to give you 24 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and pierce a hole in the middle with your thumb. Pop them on a tray lined with greaseproof paper and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Fill a deep saucepan two-thirds full with vegetable oil and place over a medium heat, until it reaches 160°C (if you don't have a thermometer, drop in a piece of bread - when it sizzles and turns brown the oil is ready). Stretch the doughnuts back into a ring, then fry them, in batches, for 1 minute on each side, or until golden. Then leave to drain on kitchen paper. To decorate your doughnuts, roll them in caster sugar or drizzle with melted chocolate and roughly chop freeze-dried berries to sprinkle over. Make a glaze by sieving the icing sugar and whisking in a little water, then brush this over your doughnuts."

They can be whizzed together quickly, then poured into a Yorkshire pudding mould and banged into the oven to get lovely and crisp on the top and bottom, and knotty, chewy and bubbly inside. They're perfect with butter, or whatever other lovely condiments you've got hanging around the cupboard. My wife loves strawberry jam with hers, Daisy loves Marmite, Poppy loves a drizzle of honey, and personally I like a little scrambled egg with a blob of ketchup or brown sauce (or both) on the plate and, depending on how I feel, a little chilli sauce. Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3 and grease a 12-hole muffin tin with some vegetable oil. Place all the other ingredients in a bowl with 2 teaspoons of sea salt and pour in 600ml of tepid water. The water needs to be warm enough to activate the yeast, but not so hot that it kills it. Whisk everything together until you've got a loose batter that is just combined - this should only take a few seconds. Leave to stand for 10 minutes to let the yeast do its job. When the mixture is a spoonable, sticky consistency, but still quite wet, spoon it into the muffin tin. Fill each hole until it's almost level with the top of the tin and cook for around 35 minutes, or until the crumpies are risen and golden. Remove to a wire rack for a few minutes to cool slightly, then serve while still warm with anything you fancy. Here are a few ideas to get your started:, Cream cheese
Jam and banana
A few slices of cooked ham
Some beautiful slices of cheese
Smoked salmon and a wedge of lemon

I hadn't realized Italian immigrants had cleverly adapted their old-world recipes to suit new-world coalfired ovens. Making pizzas in tins to protect the base from the soot of the oven makes perfect sense to me now, and I can honestly say that when it's cooked and seasoned with proper love and care, I'm more than happy with this representative of the pizza family. To make your dough, pour 650ml of lukewarm water into a large bowl and use a fork to stir in the yeast, sugar and 1 level teaspoon of fine sea salt. Add your flour, bit by bit, until it comes together. You want smooth springy dough, so keep adding a bit more flour if necessary. Dust a clean surface with flour, then knead the dough with your hands. When you're happy with the consistency, pop it into a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm room until the dough has almost doubled in size. Meanwhile, put a lug of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat. Add your sliced onions and thyme leaves and cook for 15 minutes, or until softened and golden. Take the pan off the heat and put aside. Put all the tomato sauce ingredients into a food processor or liquidizer with a good pinch of salt and black pepper and blitz to a purée. Have a taste and season carefully, adding a bit more salt and pepper if it needs it. Slit the sausages open and squeeze the meat into a bowl. Bash up the dried chilli and fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar, add these to the meat with the dried oregano and mix well with a fork. Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Divide the dough in half and oil 2 trays (about 25 x 35cm) with olive oil. Use a rolling pin or clean hands to flatten and stretch the dough out. Roll or push the dough around each tray and really push it into the corners so you get a chubby crust and a base about 1cm thick. Divide your blitzed tomato sauce between the pizzas and spread around. Scatter over the caramelized onions and dot small pinches of the sausage mixture around the top of each pizza. Tear up the mozzarella and dot the pieces over the sausage, then sprinkle over the fresh basil leaves, sliced fresh chilli, a good pinch of salt and pepper and the grated Parmesan. Finally let your slices of pancetta sort of fall on to the pizzas so they curl and crisp up as they cook. Place in the bottom of the oven for about 20 minutes so the base gets nice and crispy while the top is cooking. Once your pizzas are beautifully cooked, serve right away with a fresh green lemony salad."

Two of my favourites, chilli and cheese, do their thing in this bread and really take the flavour to a whole other level. You can serve this cornbread alongside soups or stews, but frankly, I think a good slice of this, with a bit of crunchy salad, makes a brilliant lunch. You could also reheat it in a dry pan the next day for breakfast and eat it with poached eggs and some smoky bacon . . . totally delicious. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Grease a 22cm cake tin with oil and line the base with greaseproof paper. Peel and finely slice the onions. Melt the butter in a frying pan on a medium heat, add the onions, then fry gently for 15 to 20 minutes, or until caramelised, golden and sticky. Hold the corn cobs upright on a board and carefully run a small knife from the top of the corn to the bottom, cutting all the kernels off. Add to the caramelised onions and cook for a further 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Beat the eggs in a large bowl, then mix in the cornmeal, milk, baking powder, flour and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Grate the cheese, add most of it to the bowl, then beat until well mixed. Deseed, finely chop and stir in 2 chillies, along with the cooled onion and corn mixture.

Cook for another 5 to 10 minutes, or perfectly golden. Serve the crumpets warm with a generous spoonful of ricotta, a scattering of fresh raspberries and an extra drizzle of honey, if you like."

If using cardamom pods, lightly bash them in a pestle and mortar, then pick out the husks and pound the seeds to a fine powder. Beat the eggs and a pinch of sea salt in a large bowl, then add the cardamom, sugar, melted butter, 500g of the flour and the milk and yeast mixture. Whisk constantly as you add everything so you end up with quite a thick, gluey consistency. Mix in the remaining 300g of flour until you have a dough.

Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to prove for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size and is full of air pockets.

Dust a clean surface and your hands with flour and gently stretch and pull the risen dough out until it's a bit bigger than an A4 piece of paper. This next bit is pretty messy, so have a bowl of flour on hand to help you handle the dough and don't be alarmed if it seems quite wet. Use a slotted spoon to move half the mashed blueberries on to the dough. Try not to include too much juice. Use the back of the spoon to spread the blueberries around the dough. Pull the sides of the dough up and into the middle like an envelope, and keep turning and pushing the dough together. Cut the dough into 8 equal portions, then pull and stretch each one into a long, thin sausage shape, twisting them around on themselves so you get a sort of rough knot. Arrange them on the tray, leaving enough room between for them to spread as they cook. Push your fingers into the top of each one to make a little well, then spoon in a few of the remaining mashed berries and gently push them down. Spoon over a little of the blueberry juice from the bowl, then sprinkle with the rest of your demerara and the reserved orange zest. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove for about 20 minutes in a warm place. Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4.

There's a slightly Spanish feel to the main ingredients - think of it as putting a bunch of old friends together and having a good party! My mother's initial reaction was, â€˜My God, that's a lot of garlic, you'll stink!' but don't let the amount put you off, as when garlic is roasted in its skin the pungent flavour is replaced by a jammy sweetness which is divine. Roast the garlic cloves in a preheated oven at 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for around half an hour until soft to the touch. Meanwhile, take a large pot and slowly fry the white onion in 4 tablespoons of olive oil for about 10 minutes until really soft and translucent. Add the cream and the stock, bring back to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes, awaiting your garlic. Remove the garlic from the oven and allow to cool slightly before squeezing out all the sweet, golden paste. Whisk this into the soup. Discard the garlic skins. Remove the crusts from your ciabatta, rip up the bread into small pieces and throw into the soup. Add the sherry vinegar, then allow the soup to simmer for 5 more minutes. Whiz it until smooth in your food processor with your toasted almonds. Season nicely to taste and serve in big bowls sprinkled with some orange segments, torn up coriander and mint, and drizzled with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil. Try this: You can eat this cold in the summer - it's obviously going to be thick, which I think is a nice thing, but you can thin it with a little milk or stock if you want to. And this: You may want to big up the sherry vinegar to give it that twang you get with a Spanish gazpacho soup. Or this: There's a similar recipe from Spain where sliced white grapes are added to the soup - this contrasts really well with the garlic, so give it a go. A handful will do. Nice when eaten both hot and cold."

This is also a great way to use up leftovers from a roast pork joint. Preheat your oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3. Score the pork shoulder.

They're used for breakfast, lunch or dinner and carry, complement or mop up whatever is being served with them. Apparently, in the old days, if a Navajo woman couldn't whip up a batch of fluffy flatbreads, her chances of marrying a decent bloke were pretty low. No pressure! These are brilliantly simple to make. Mix your flour, baking powder and herbs or spices (if using) in a large bowl with 1 heaped teaspoon of sea salt, using a fork. Make a well in the centre, then pour in the olive oil and about 150ml of warm water. Use the fork to gradually bring in the flour from the edge of the bowl, and add another splash of water if you think it's too dry. Once it starts to combine, wet your hands and use them to really bring it all together until you have a nice ball of dough. Dust your hands and a clean work surface with flour and knead the dough with your hands until it is smooth and elastic. This will take about 5 to 10 minutes. Pop the dough back into the bowl, dust it with a bit more flour, then cover and leave to relax. Divide your dough into 10 equal-sized balls, then lightly oil your hands and squeeze each ball between your palms to flatten them slightly. Dust with a little flour as you go, and pat and slap the dough from the palm of one hand to the top of the other. Turn and twist the dough about in a circular movement as you go and keep slapping from hand to hand - each flatbread should be about 1cm thick. You'll probably mess up a few, but practice makes perfect. Normally the flatbreads are cooked as you're making them. You can do this on a barbecue or in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Cook them for a few minutes on each side and check the underside - you want them to puff up with a nice bit of golden colour. Keep them warm in a basket covered with a tea towel until you're ready to serve them. Serve them while they're lovely and warm, or you can reheat them with anything from burgers, to stews and soups, to salads."

This should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Cover the mixing bowl with a tea towel and leave to rest, in a warm place, for 45 minutes or until the dough has doubled in size. This allows the bread to become lighter and softer in texture. While the dough is rising, prepare a baking tray by lightly oiling the base and sides using vegetable oil. Now's a good time to make sure your wood fire oven is pre-lit and ready for your bread. Transfer the dough to the baking tray. Spread out evenly using the palm of your hands and gently expel the gas from the dough (you'll notice that the dough is airy). Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil over the surface of the dough using your fingertips; 'dimple' the dough ensuring that you don't press all the way through to the base. Cover with the tea towel and leave to rest in a warm place for a further 20 to 40 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size. Place the baking tray in the wood-fired oven for 15 minutes or until lightly golden; this will vary depending on temperature so it's best to keep a close eye on the bread for your first attempt. Just prior to the bread coming out of the wood-fired oven, mix together 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of water. Whisk lightly until it becomes an opaque emulsion. Once removed, brush the bread with the emulsion (I use a pastry brush), which makes the bread surface moist.

They were the lightest pizzas I've ever eaten - just incredible - and this is how the first ever pizzas were made.
First, make your basic pizza dough. Now make your tomato sauce. Heat a saucepan, add a splash of oil and the sliced garlic and cook gently. When the garlic has turned light golden, add half the basil, the tomatoes and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Cook gently for about 20 minutes, mashing the tomatoes until smooth, then taste, season again and put to one side. Preheat your grill to its highest temperature. Divide the dough into 10 pieces and press them flat on to a floured work surface. Roll them out to about 0.5cm/Â¼ inch thick and allow them to rest for 10 minutes or so. Heat a frying pan over a high heat, add about 2cm of vegetable oil and fry each pizza for 30 seconds or so on each side. Remove with tongs and place on a baking tray.

Add the yeast and sugar to 650ml lukewarm water, mix together and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well. Using a fork and a circular movement, slowly bring in the flour from the inner edge of the well and mix into the water. Continue to mix, bringing in all the flour - when the dough comes together and becomes too hard to mix with your fork, flour your hands and begin to pat it into a ball. Knead the dough by rolling it backwards and forwards, using your hands to stretch, pull and push the dough. Keep kneading for 10 minutes, or until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to to prove for 45 minutes, or until doubled in size. For the sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick the basil leaves and finely chop the stalks. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan on a medium-low heat, add the garlic and basil stalks, then cook gently for a couple of minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden, then add most of the basil leaves, the tomatoes, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Leave the sauce to tick away for around 20 minutes, or until smooth, breaking up the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon. When the time's up, taste, and season to perfection. To assemble the pizzas, divide the dough in half. Wrap one half in clingfilm and freeze for another day. With the remaining half, divide the dough into 4 equal balls. Flour each dough ball, then cover with clingfilm, and leave to rest for about 15 minutes - this will make them easier to roll it thinly. Dust a clean surface and the dough with a little flour or semolina, and roll it out into a rough circle, about Â½cm thick. Tear off an appropriately sized piece of tin foil, rub it with olive oil, dust well with flour or semolina and place the pizza base on top. Continue doing the same with the remaining dough, dust with a little flour so you can pile them up. Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge. When you're ready to cook them, preheat the oven to 250°C/500°F/gas 9. At this stage you can apply your topping: spread the tomato sauce over the base, spreading it out to the edges. Tear over the mozzarella and scatter with the remaining basil leaves. Drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil and add a pinch of salt and pepper. If you can, cook the pizzas on a piece of granite in your conventional oven - if not, cook them one by one on pieces of tin foil directly on the bars of the oven shelf, towards the bottom of the oven (If you're going to cook your pizzas on the bars of the oven, make sure they're not too big - otherwise they'll be difficult to manoeuvre). Cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the pizzas are golden and crispy."

Pile the flour on to a clean surface and make a large well in the centre. Pour half your water into the well, then add your yeast, sugar and salt and stir with a fork. Stage 2: getting it together
Slowly, but confidently, bring in the flour from the inside of the well. (You don't want to break the walls of the well, or the water will go everywhere.) Continue to bring the flour in to the centre until you get a stodgy, porridgey consistency - then add the remaining water. Continue to mix until it's stodgy again, then you can be more aggressive, bringing in all the flour, making the mix less sticky. Flour your hands and pat and push the dough together with all the remaining flour. (Certain flours need a little more or less water, so feel free to adjust.), Stage 3: kneading!
This is where you get stuck in. With a bit of elbow grease, simply push, fold, slap and roll the dough around, over and over, for 4 or 5 minutes until you have a silky and elastic dough. Stage 4: first prove
Flour the top of your dough. Put it in a bowl, cover with cling film, and allow it to prove for about half an hour until doubled in size - ideally in a warm, moist, draught-free place. This will improve the flavour and texture of your dough and it's always exciting to know that the old yeast has kicked into action. Stage 5: second prove, flavouring and shaping
Once the dough has doubled in size, knock the air out for 30 seconds by bashing it and squashing it. You can now shape it or flavour it as required - folded, filled, tray-baked, whatever - and leave it to prove for a second time for 30 minutes to an hour until it has doubled in size once more. This is the most important part, as the second prove will give it the air that finally ends up being cooked into your bread, giving you the really light, soft texture that we all love in fresh bread. So remember - don't fiddle with it, just let it do its thing. Stage 6: cooking your bread
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Very gently place your bread dough on to a flour-dusted baking tray and into the preheated oven.  Don't slam the door or you'll lose the air that you need. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until cooked and golden brown. You can tell if it's cooked by tapping its bottom - if it sounds hollow it's done, if it doesn't then pop it back in for a little longer. Once cooked, place on a rack and allow it to cool for at least 30 minutes - fandabidozi. Feel free to freeze any leftover bread."

Then continue through the basic recipe as normal. At Stage 5 divide the dough into 10 balls. Then pack these next to each other in a flour-dusted baking tin where they will prove together. Before putting in the oven drizzle generously with the rest of the honey so that the top of the bread will caramelize, going nice and golden.

Roll out the remaining pastry to Â½cm thick and a little bigger than the pie dish, then carefully place on top of the pie, trimming off any overhang. Pinch the edges to seal and make two small incisions in the centre for the steam to escape. Use any spare pastry to decorate the pie, if you like.

Pick and tear the basil leaves, then add to the pan with the tomatoes. Using the back of a wooden spoon, mush and squash the tomatoes as much as you can. Season to taste. As soon as it comes to the boil, remove the pan from the heat. Strain the sauce through a coarse sieve into a bowl, using the spoon to push any larger bits of tomato through. Discard the basil and garlic left in the sieve, but scrape any tomatoey goodness off the back of the sieve into the bowl. Pour the sauce back into the pan, bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Cook until it's the perfect consistency for spreading on your pizza bases. For the pizza dough, sieve the flour and salt onto a clean work surface and make a well in the middle. In a jug, mix the yeast, sugar and olive oil into 650ml lukewarm water and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well. Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. When it all starts to come together, work the rest of the flour in with your clean hands. Knead until you have a smooth, springy dough. Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for an hour until the dough has doubled in size. Remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out. You can use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in clingfilm, in the fridge (or freezer) until required. If using straight away, divide the dough up into 6 to 8 balls. Timing-wise, it's a good idea to roll the pizza bases out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to cook them. Stack the pizza bases, with a square of oiled tin foil between each one, cover them with clingfilm, and pop them into the fridge. Now's the time to get your wood-fired oven, or conventional oven, heated up to full whack. Place a couple of heavy baking trays in the oven to heat up, too. Meanwhile, click off the broccoli florets and roughly chop (using the stalk, too). Blanch in boiled salted water for 1 to 2 minutes, then drain. Tear the anchovies into small pieces, then deseed and finely chop the chilli. Squeeze the sausage meat out of their skins, then roll into small, rough meatballs. When you're ready to assemble your pizzas, remove a tray from the oven, put a pizza base on it and assemble it quickly - smear tomato sauce on the base and dot with broccoli, torn up anchovy fillets and sausage meatballs. Tear over the Taleggio cheese and sprinkle with chilli. Crush and scatter over the fennel seeds. Place in the oven immediately while you prepare the remaining pizzas. If you're using a wood-fired oven the pizzas should cook, one by one, in about 3 to 4 minutes - you want them to be puffed up, crispy and delicious. In a regular oven, they'll take 8 to 10 minutes. Serve hot."

For the butter, peel the garlic, then finely chop with the parsley leaves and mix into the softened butter with the cayenne. Firm up in the fridge. Working one-by-one on a board, stuff the chicken breasts. To do this, start by pulling back the loose fillet on the back of the breast - put your knife in the opposite direction and slice to create a long pocket (for extra guidance, watch the how-to video below). Open the pocket up with your fingers, cut the chilled butter into four and push one piece into the pocket, then crumble in a rasher of crispy bacon. Fold and seal back the chicken, completely covering the butter and giving you a nice neat parcel. Repeat with the 3 remaining breasts. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Place the flour in one shallow bowl, whisk the eggs in another, and put the breadcrumbs and a pinch of seasoning into a third. Evenly coat each chicken breast in flour, then beaten egg, letting any excess drip off, and finally, turn them in the breadcrumbs, patting them on until evenly coated. Shallow-fry in 2cm of sunflower oil on a medium to high heat for a couple of minutes on each side, or until lightly golden, then transfer to a tray and bake in the oven for 10 minutes, or until cooked through. You can bake them completely in the oven and skip the frying altogether, you just need to drizzle them with olive oil and bake for about 20 minutes - they won't be as golden, but they'll be just as delicious. Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the potatoes and cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Chop up the broccoli and add it to the potatoes for the last 8 minutes. Drain and leave to steam dry, then return to the pan and mash with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper. Divide the mash between your plates and place a Kyiv on top of each portion. Lightly dress the spinach leaves or rocket in a little oil and lemon juice, then sprinkle over the top as a salady garnish. Serve with a wedge of lemon on the side."

Now add the lemon juice, a couple of lugs of olive oil and some pepper, and mix together until you have a sauce with a good drizzling consistency. Get a large, ovenproof, non-stick frying pan hot. Pat the salmon fillets with a little olive oil, season them with salt and pepper and cook them in the pan, skin-side down, for 2 minutes. Flip them over, then place the pan in the preheated oven for another 3 to 4 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets and the way they've been sliced. Just after the salmon goes into the oven, put your broccoli into some boiling, salted water for 3 to 4 minutes until perfectly cooked. To check if the fish is cooked all the way through, you can pull the fillets apart a little bit and look inside. Salmon goes from being an orangey colour to an opaque pink, so that's what you're looking for. Please do not overcook them, because, as simple as this dish sounds, it's your mission to â€˜just' cook the fish so you're rewarded with a soft inside and a slightly crispy outside - heaven!, When the broccoli's perfectly done, drain it, toss it in a little of the anchovy-rosemary sauce and divide it between your plates.

Blanch your broccoli florets and sliced stalks really quickly in boiling salted water for 60 seconds, just long enough to soften the broccoli but still leave it with a bit of a bite. Drain it in a colander, then spread it around a clean tea towel to steam dry (this is important because it will help the dressing cling to the broccoli). Once completely dry, transfer to a serving dish. Finely slice the bacon and fry on a medium heat with a small splash of olive oil until crisp and golden, then spoon most of the bacon bits over your broccoli. Any leftover fat in the pan can be used in your salad dressing. Pour it into a mixing bowl, then peel and finely grate in the garlic. Add all the other dressing ingredients, season with sea salt and black pepper, and whisk. Halve, deseed and finely slice the tomatoes and chop the chives, reserving the flowers.

Beat and stir in 1 egg, then gently scrunch the dough into a ball - be careful not to overwork it. Wrap and rest in the freezer or fridge for 30 minutes. Slice the pastry lengthways into pieces just under 1cm thick, then distribute around the sides and base of a 26cm loose-bottomed tart tin.

In a large roasting tray, mix the curry paste with a pinch of sea salt, 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon of vinegar. Wash the parsnip, carrots and butternut squash (we're leaving the skins on). Quarter the parsnip lengthways, remove the fluffy core and chop into bite-sized chunks (about 2cm), adding to the tray as you go. Repeat with the courgette, then chop up the carrots. Deseed the squash and chop to a similar size. Get it all in the tray with the cauliflower and mix until well coated. Roast the veg for 40 to 50 minutes, or until golden, gnarly and cooked through. Meanwhile, for the sauce, put a large shallow casserole pan on a medium heat. Peel and finely chop the ginger and garlic, and place in the pan with 1 tablespoon of oil, stirring regularly. As soon as it starts to colour, stir in the mango chutney. Let it sizzle for a minute, then pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with your spoon. As soon as they start to bubble, add the coconut milk. Bring it to the boil, then turn off the heat. To make the naans, melt the butter in a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat, then add the cloves and cinnamon stick. Trim the leek and quarter lengthways, wash, finely slice and add to the pan, followed by the spinach. Stir regularly, until dark, dry and intense, then remove and leave to cool. Pour the flour into a large bowl with a pinch of salt, make a well in the middle and add 1 mug (300ml) of water (using the same mug you used to measure your flour, a regular cup is fine) and 1 tablespoon of oil. Use a fork to gradually mix the flour into the liquid, until it gets too hard to mix. At this point, use your clean floured hands to knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for a couple of minutes, adding a little extra flour, if needed. You want it to be pliable so don't add too much flour, but it shouldn't be sticking to your work surface. Now, oil your surface, then stretch and push the dough out into a 30cm circle. Crumble the feta over the cool spinach mixture and mix together, then place in the middle of the dough, leaving a 5cm border at the edge. Fold in the dough over the filling, patting it together as you go and sealing the filling inside, then pat out to just under 25cm. Wipe out your frying pan, then gently lift the naan into it. Cook the naan at the bottom of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and crisp on the outside, fluffy in the middle. A few minutes before you're ready to serve, bring the sauce back to a simmer, then add all the roasted veg and the frozen peas, and simmer until the peas are cooked and the sauce is a good consistency. Slice up your naan and serve up with your curry at the table. Nice with a dollop of yoghurt and any chutney or pickles, if you like."

Place it in a tray and roast in the preheated oven for around 2 hours, turning it every now and then. Halfway through, you'll probably need to drain away a lot of the fat from the bird.

Sprinkle over the ground spices and give the squash a good toss, spreading the pieces out in one layer. Once the duck has been in the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, add the tray of squash to the oven and roast for about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse the squash seeds after removing any fibres. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Toast them in a dry frying pan until they're golden and crisp, and put aside. To make the dressing, put the lime juice and zest into a bowl and add the same amount of extra virgin olive oil, plus the sesame oil and the soy sauce. Stir in the sugar, chilli, garlic, the green spring onion ends and coriander stalks. Taste and adjust the sweet-and-sourness and the seasoning. You want it to be a little limey, to contrast with the rich duck. After 2 hours, if the duck is nice and crispy, and the squash soft and sticky, take both trays out of the oven. If they need more time, leave them in until perfectly done. Using two forks, shred the duck meat off the bone and put into a large bowl. While the duck and squash are still warm, toss with the toasted seeds, half the coriander leaves, half the mint and half the white spring onion slices. Pour on the dressing and toss together.

Leave a space free at either side so you can roll the pastry around the filling. To do this, hold one side of the baking parchment and lift it, with the pastry, towards the centre of the Wellington so it starts to cover the filling. Peel the baking parchment back, leaving the pastry in place, then do the same with the other side. The pastry should overlap in the middle. Beat the egg with the milk and brush it over the pastry join to seal the join. Fold up the ends so the filling doesn't leak out, then carefully roll the Wellington onto a baking sheet, with the seal underneath. Brush all over with the egg mix.

Meanwhile, halve, deseed and rough chop the squash. When the time's up, add the squash and stock to the pan. Bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes. For the croutons, drizzle a little olive oil over the ciabatta, pat it in, then finely grate and press some grated Parmesan on to each side. Place in a dry, non-stick pan and fry until golden on both sides. When the squash is tender, whiz the soup with a stick blender or pour it into a blender and pulse to a smooth purée - leave it slightly chunky, if you prefer. Season to perfection with salt and pepper, then divide between bowls, placing 2 croutons on top of each. Sprinkle with a few crispy sage leaves and drizzle with a swirl of quality extra virgin olive oil, then serve."

Even though it's very Tuscan in style, the flavours remind me of English chutney recipes that I've come across in old cookbooks. When roasted like this, the squash is wonderful eaten as part of an antipasti plate, or in soups, or tossed with pasta, or with meat. Other types of squash that are great for roasting are onion squash (which has a dense orange skin) and acorn squash (which has an orangey-grey skin and is a bit more squashed than round). Ask your local fruit and veg man for guidance if you're not sure.
Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Halve the butternut squash, remove and reserve the seeds, then cut the squash into slices or chunks with the skin left on. Using a pestle and mortar, or a metal bowl with a rolling pin, bash up the dried red chilli with a good pinch of salt. Add the whole sage leaves, the pieces of cinnamon and enough olive oil to loosen the mixture, and rub the whole lot over all the squash pieces so they are well covered.

Lay out your shoulder of lamb. What you want to do is delicately flavour the meat, so pound up the coriander seeds with the rosemary and a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar (or use a metal bowl and a rolling pin) until nice and fine. Take half this mixture and rub it over the inside of the lamb. Season it well with salt and pepper, then roll up the lamb and secure it with 4 or 5 pieces of string. The reason for doing this is to make the meat a consistent thickness - don't worry about doing it neatly, as long as it holds together it's fine. Put a high-sided roasting tray on the hob and brown the lamb on all sides in a little olive oil. Remove from the heat, allow the lamb to cool a little, then add the red onions to the tray. Lift up the lamb, stir the onions around to cover them in all the flavoursome juices, then sit the lamb back on top and cook in the preheated oven for around 2 hours, adding the cranberry juice after the first half an hour and turning the heat down to 170°C/325°F/gas 3. Turn the meat in its cooking juices when you can. By the end of the 2 hours you want the meat to be nice and crisp on the outside but really melt-in-your-mouth and tender. Sometimes the lamb may need a little longer, depending on the age of the animal. You'll also want enough juice left in the bottom of the tray to give everyone a nice spoonful - if it looks as if the liquid is going to cook away too quickly, add a little water and place a cartouche on top. Skim off any fat that cooks out of the meat. While the lamb is cooking, rub the butternut squash with the rest of the spice mix and a drizzle of olive oil. Lay it in another roasting tray, season well and put it in the oven when the lamb's been cooking for just over an hour. Cook for around 45 minutes, until sweet and tender. When the lamb's cooked, let it rest for 10 minutes, then remove the string. In a bowl mix together the coriander leaves, spring onions, lemon juice, 4 tablespoons of olive oil and seasoning. Toss together. To serve, divide the squash between your plates, cut up the lamb into irregular sized slices, spoon over some tray juices, and sprinkle on the herb salad. A dollop of yoghurt on top is lovely."

Chop the top few leaves off your bunch of coriander and pop to one side, then add the rest to the processor and blitz for 30 seconds or so until fairly fine. With the processor still running, add a few good lugs of olive oil, the five-spice and ground cumin. Tip this mixture straight into your hot pan, you can add a splash of stock to loosen it if you want, and fry and stir for a couple of minutes so it starts smelling fantastic. Add your sliced onion, then cook gently for 8 to 10 minutes. Add the squash to the pan and stir well, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until the squash is lovely and soft. At this point, add the rice and give it a really good stir. If it looks a bit dry, you can add a splash of water here. Continue to simmer for about 8 minutes until the rice is almost cooked, then add the coconut milk and bring back to the boil. Simmer for a couple of minutes until hot through and thickened a little. I like to squash up some of the squash at this point too. Take the pan off the heat, give it a good stir, then taste and season carefully with salt and pepper. To give it a bit of twang add the lime juice - the amount you need will depend on how juicy your limes are, so keep tasting it as you go. Scatter with more sliced fresh chilli and your reserved coriander leaves before serving. If you're making this for a party, what I like to do is to hack the top off a massive pumpkin, scoop out the insides, then bake the shell in the oven for 40 minutes at 100°C/220°F/gas Â¼. You can then use this as a receptacle for your hot soup, and as long as it's an inch or so thick, it should keep warm for a good hour or so.

Fill the paper cases with the cake mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Check to see whether they are cooked properly by sticking a wooden skewer or a knife right into one of the cakes - if it comes out clean, they're done. If it's a bit sticky, pop them back into the oven for a little longer. Remove from the oven and leave the cakes to cool on a wire rack. As soon as the muffins are in the oven, make your runny frosted topping. Place most of the clementine zest, all the lemon zest and the lemon juice in a bowl. Add the soured cream, icing sugar and vanilla seeds and mix well. Taste and have a think about it - adjust the amount of lemon juice or icing sugar to balance the sweet and sour. Put into the fridge until your cakes have cooled down, then spoon the topping on to the cakes. Serve on a lovely plate (or on a cake stand if you're feeling elegant, or on a rustic slab if you're more of a hunter-gatherer type!), with the rest of the clementine zest sprinkled over.

Stir the cooked veg into the pan and crush gently with a potato masher - don't overdo it: you want a fairly chunky mixture. Squeeze in the lemon juice and season to taste. Leave to cool, then pick, finely chop and stir in the coriander leaves. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Lightly grease a large baking tray with oil.

Using a 7cm pastry cutter, stamp out as many circles as you can, then roll into rounds, roughly Â½cm thick and 18cm in diameter. Cut each round in half, then brush the straight edges with a little water. Roll into a cone shape, bringing the straight edges together and pressing lightly to seal. Spoon in the filling, brush the exposed dough with a little water, then fold over and press to seal. Place onto the prepared baking tray, then repeat with the remaining ingredients, keeping the samosas covered with a damp tea towel as you go.

Add the onions, turn down the heat and sauté for 10 minutes, or until soft and sticky, but not coloured. Add the fresh mushrooms, turn up the heat and fry hard and fast for 5 minutes. Fish out and chop half of the soaked porcini, add to the pan and fry for a few more minutes. Add 350ml of the stock and the potatoes and season well. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Using a stick blender, blitz the mushrooms just a little - you want them to still be fairly chunky. Pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, then stir about half into the mix. Divide the filling between 6 small pie dishes, reserving 4 heaped tablespoons for later. Chop the Tunworth into 1-2cm pieces and scatter evenly into each of the pie dishes. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. To make the lids, roll out the pastry on a flour-dusted surface to roughly the thickness of a pound coin. Cut into 6 pieces, to the shape of your pie dishes, and lay one over the top of each, tucking the edges down slightly. Carefully score each pie lid with a crisscross, then gently press your thumb in the middle of each one to make a well (without puncturing the pastry). Beat the egg and brush it over the pies, then place in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until puffed up and beautifully golden. Now to make the sauce. In a pan, stir the mustard and Worcestershire sauce into the remaining filling. Pour in the leftover porcini liquid, then roughly chop the remaining porcini and add to the mix. Place the pan over a high heat, pour in the remaining stock and bring everything to the boil. Stir in the rest of the parsley a minute or two before the end, then blitz in a liquidiser until smooth and pour into a jug. To serve, pour the gravy into the wells of the pies, and serve with a dollop of English mustard."

Put your biscuits into a food processor and whiz until you've got really fine crumbs, then mix in your melted butter. If you don't have a food processor, just wrap your biscuits in a tea towel and bash them up with a rolling pin until fine.

Place the tin on a baking sheet and pop it into the fridge while you make the filling. Whiz the cream cheese in a food processor until smooth, then gradually add the sugar. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each one. Pour in the lime juice and vanilla seeds or extract and whiz again until just combined. Again, if you don't have a food processor, just do this by hand. Don't worry if the mixture seems too thin - it's supposed to be like that. Tip it over your chilled biscuit base, spread it out evenly, and bake in the oven for around 45 to 55 minutes - you want the cheesecake to still have a slight loose wobble. Remove from the oven and set aside for 15 minutes to cool slightly. Turn the oven up to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. To make the meringue topping, put your egg whites into a clean bowl and beat until they form soft peaks - an electric whisk is quite handy here. Gradually add the caster sugar and beat until thick and glossy. Finally, fold in the coconut. Spoon this meringue mixture on to the middle of the cooled cheesecake and spread it to the edges, using the back of a spoon, so it just covers the filling. It should be about 2cm thick. I like to make a few ripples and peaks in the top so it looks impressive. Bake in the oven for 5 minutes, or until the meringue is starting to turn golden in colour and is crisp to touch.

Transfer everything into a bowl and season carefully with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon or lime juice.

Some people like to fry them in oil, but this makes them greasy and is not all that healthy. You can grill them, but I like to put them in a dry non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, so that after about a minute and a half on each side you are left with a really crispy outside and an oozy, stringy filling.

Great for a starter or a snack, and I've even made little mini ones as canapés (dare I say that word?!). Remove the crusts from the ciabatta and tear up into rough 2.5cm/1 inch pieces.

Line up the kebabs on a wire rack and place under the grill on a very high heat until the bread and bacon are golden and crisp and the mozzarella is nice and gooey. While this is grilling make sure you keep an eye on it, as it can turn into a charred kebab very quickly. To make the dressing, chop up the olives and mix with the chilli, 5 tablespoons of the lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Season to taste. To serve the kebabs, dress the herbs with half of the olive dressing right at the last minute so the leaves stay nice and fresh, then use the other half of the dressing drizzled over the kebabs. Try this: Do exactly the same as above but swap the mozzarella for cubes of fresh white fish such as haddock, cod or monkfish."

You can use the spices as a dry rub, or muddle in 2 tablespoons each of olive oil and red wine vinegar to make a marinade. Use a fork to pierce the underside of the chicken a few times, going all the way down to the bone (this will help create big flavour). Toss the chicken in the spiced rub or marinade, then cover and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight. Place all of the sauce ingredients into a medium saucepan over a high heat (you can do this on the hob or by placing a small pan on the direct side of the barbecue). Add a pinch of sea salt, whisk well to combine, then bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it's sticky and coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and allow it to cool slightly. Once you're ready to cook, preheat your barbecue (see tip). Place the chicken skin-side down on the direct or hot side of the barbecue and cook for 2 minutes, calming down any flames by putting the lid on. Using tongs, carefully turn the chicken over and transfer to the cooler part of the barbecue, where the indirect heat is (if you want to add some water-soaked fruit woods, such as Applewood, to the coals for bonus flavour, now's the time to do it). Place the lid on (the holes in the lid should be open to allow the air to flow through), and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, checking and turning the chicken throughout, or until the chicken pulls easily away from the bone. When removing the lid, just crack it open slightly before lifting it off completely - this will prevent the ash from blowing up onto the chicken and tainting the flavour. Baste the chicken in half the BBQ sauce (save the rest for another day), place back over the indirect heat and pop the lid back on for 10 minutes, or until sticky, juicy and gnarly. Check the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear, then transfer to a large serving board or platter. If using, finely chop and scatter over the fresh chilli and slice the lemon into wedges for squeezing over. Delicious served with a seasonal salad or barbecued vegetables, rice and flatbreads."

Pull out the wings and cut them off at the base, cutting slightly into the breast so you get a generous meaty portion. Lightly cut through the skin between the chicken leg and breast, so that the leg falls to the side. Bend the leg backwards to disjoint it, and turn breast-side down. Cut between the leg and breast, removing the whole leg, then repeat. Find the joint in between the drumstick and thigh, tap the heel of the knife and cut through the bone, separating the drumstick and thigh, then repeat. Leaving the breasts on the bone, carefully cut between the breasts and backbone to separate the front and back of the bird. Slice between the breasts on the bone to separate, then use the heel of the knife to cut across each breast through the bone, leaving you with two large chunks, then slice each chunk into four pieces. Season the chicken with sea salt, black pepper and 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds. Pop the carcass in a bag and put in the freezer for tasty cooking another day - it makes an amazing stock. Put a large non-stick pan on a medium-high heat with 50g of butter. Add the chicken wings, legs and thighs skin-side down to brown in the pan for around 3Â½ minutes, or until golden all over, turning occasionally. Once the butter is dark brown and almost burnt, transfer the chicken to a plate and throw away the oil and butter left in the pan. This will leave you with tasty sticky goodness at the bottom of the pan, which will give you a lovely caramelly flavour later on. Return your chicken to the pan with another 50g of butter, and repeat the process, turning the chicken for another 3Â½ minutes, or until the butter is dark brown, then throwing away the almost burnt butter. Go in with the breast meat and another 50g of butter, and return the browned meat to the pan for a final time along with the bulb of garlic, turning the meat occasionally to get an even golden colour. Meanwhile, peel, quarter and add the onion. Finely slice the fennel stalks, stopping when you hit the bulb, finely slice the leafy tops, and cut the bulb into quarters, adding to the pan as you go. Scrape up any sticky bits from the bottom of the pan, then make a well in the middle and add the final 50g of butter. Use a speed-peeler to peel big chunks of lemon zest into the butter, pick in a large handful of sage leaves and add the cinnamon stick. Fry for a couple of minutes, or until the veg is softened, stirring occasionally. Pour in around 1 litre of milk (half of the chicken should be submerged) and scrape up all the lovely sticky bits. Squeeze in the lemon juice. The lemon zest will sort of split the milk, making a sauce which is absolutely fantastic. Reduce the heat, cover with a cartouche (greaseproof-paper disc) and simmer for 50 minutes, removing for the final 20 minutes. Taste and check the seasoning and remove the cinnamon stick. To serve, pull the meat off the bones and divide between plates. Spoon over plenty of juice and the little curds. Delicious served with Parmesan polenta and lemony greens."

Place the couscous in a bowl and add Â½ a tablespoon of oil. Finely grate in the zest of Â½ a lemon, squeeze in half the juice, then add the squeezed half for extra flavour. Just cover with boiling kettle water - get an adult to help you if you need to. Cover the bowl and put aside. Now, very carefully push 3 skewers horizontally into each chicken breast (if the skewers are too long, cut them in half). Wash your hands, then season the chicken breasts with black pepper, squeeze over the juice of Â½ a lemon and drizzle with Â½ a tablespoon of olive oil. You can cook the skewers on a hot barbecue or in a hot frying pan on the hob. Always get an adult to help you! Either way, cook the skewers for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning regularly with tongs. For the final minute of cooking, grab your rosemary sprigs and use them to brush the honey over the chicken, giving it a lovely sticky glaze. To make a zingy salsa, first clean down your board. Halve, deseed and finely chop the pepper. Peel and finely chop the onion and the pineapple, then pop everything in a bowl, dress with a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, then season to perfection. If you've got them, finely chop some fresh soft herbs using the cross-chop method, and add to the mix. Uncover the couscous, fluff it up with a fork, and divide between your plates. On a clean board, use a sharp knife to slice the chicken between the skewers. Check that it's cooked and if it needs another minute or two, simply put it back on the barbecue. Place 3 chicken lollipops on each plate, and serve with the pineapple and pepper salsa, natural yoghurt, for dipping, and lemon wedges, for squeezing over."

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 1Â½ hours, or until the chicken is cooked through and falling away from the bone, skimming away and discarding any scum that rises to the surface. Turn off the heat and leave the chicken to soak in the pot until ready to serve. For the mole, halve and deseed the dried peppers, then lightly toast in a dry frying pan for a couple of minutes (being careful not to char them) - you may need to do this in batches. Tip into a large heatproof bowl, cover with boiling water and leave to soften (about 20 minutes). Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of pork dripping in a large, deep frying pan on a medium heat. Add the sesame seeds, peanuts and almonds, and toast for 5 minutes, or until golden. Remove to a bowl. Add another tablespoon of dripping to the pan. Peel and roughly chop the onions and garlic, then fry with the ground spices for 5 to 10 minutes, or until softened. Peel the plantain and roughly chop with the tomatoes. Add to the pan, along with the raisins and toasted nuts and seeds (reserving 3 tablespoons for serving). Roughly tear in the corn tortilla and bread roll, then drain the peppers and mix everything together in a large bowl ready for blitzing. Working in batches, transfer the mixture to a liquidiser and whiz until smooth, adding a little water to each batch until you reach the desired consistency. Pass the mixture through a coarse sieve into a large pan on a low heat, with 4 tablespoons of dripping. Coarsely grate in the dark chocolate, stir it through the mole, then  leave to simmer for 1 hour, or until the flavours have mellowed and the sauce is rich and thick, stirring regularly. Have a taste and season to perfection, adding a little poaching liquor from the chicken to loosen. For the corn salsa, preheat a griddle pan on a medium-high heat. Add the corn and toast for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the kernels are scorched and blackened, turning regularly for even cooking. Alternatively, char the corn directly on a gas hob. Carefully slice the kernels from the cob with a sharp knife. Finely zest 1 lime over a serving bowl, then squeeze in the juice of both limes and add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Peel the red onion and finely dice with the tomatoes, slice the jalapeÃ±os (deseed, if you like), then add to the bowl, along with the corn. Toss well and leave to one side. For the green rice, dollop the dripping into a pan on a medium heat. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, add to the pan and cook for a couple of minutes.

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked. Pull the chicken from the carcass and shred the meat. Bash the reserved seeds and nuts in a pestle and mortar to a chunky crumb. Ladle about 500ml of mole into a clean pan and keep warm while you assemble the enchiladas. Working two to three at a time, brush the outside of the tortillas with a little pork dripping, then flip them over and top each with a good handful of chicken. Fold them in half, pressing the edges to seal. Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat and fry the tortillas for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp.

Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden and nutty. Put the kimchi, gochujang, soy sauce, rice vinegar and 2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds into a blender, and whiz until smooth. Place the chicken in a snug-fitting baking tray. Pour one third of the marinade over the chicken and rub it in to all the nooks and crannies. Roast for 1 hour 20 minutes, or until everything is gnarly and cooked through. Add the honey to the remaining marinade and blitz until combined. Pour half into a small bowl and set aside - this will be your dipping sauce. Keep the rest of the sauce for your glaze. For the buns, cut out 12 x 8cm squares of greaseproof paper and rub each one with a little sesame oil to stop the buns sticking. Pour the coconut milk into a large mixing bowl, then add the flour and a good pinch of sea salt. Start mixing with a fork then get in there with your hands and knead until you have a soft, smooth dough - or do all this in a food processor. Tip the dough onto a flour-dusted work surface and roll into a sausage shape. Quarter it, then cut each piece into three to make 12 even-sized pieces and roll each into a ball. One-by-one, with a rolling pin, roll the balls into 10cm x 12cm ovals. Lay an oiled chopstick across the middle like a hinge, fold the dough in half and pull the chopstick out. Place each bun on a little rectangle of greaseproof paper ready for steaming. Remove the chicken from the oven and turn it off. Spoon over the reserved glaze to create another sticky layer and sprinkle over the remaining sesame seeds. Transfer to a plate and return to the oven to keep warm and tighten up the glaze while you cook the buns. Working in batches, place the buns on their greaseproof squares into a large bamboo steamer and pop the lid on. Place the steamer over a large frying pan or wok filled with 300ml of boiling water and steam for 8 to 10 minutes, or until fluffy and cooked through. For the slaw, scrub the carrots, trim the spring onions and chillies (deseed if you like), bok choi and cabbage. Finely zest and juice the limes into a serving bowl, add a little sesame oil and a good pinch of gochugaru. Finely chop all the slaw ingredients, drop them into the dressing bowl and toss with your hands to dress. Shred the chicken and serve with the coconut buns, slaw and remaining sauce."

While the potatoes are cooking, preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Cut each chicken thigh into three strips and place in a bowl. Rub the meat all over with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper, then toss. Heat a large frying pan, big enough to hold all the chicken pieces snugly in one layer, and put the chicken into the pan, skin side down. If you don't have a pan that's big enough, feel free to cook the chicken in two batches. Toss and fry over a low heat for 10 minutes, or until almost cooked, then remove with a slotted spoon to a large roasting tray or dish. Prick the tomatoes with a sharp knife. Place them in a bowl, cover with boiling water and leave for a minute or so. Drain and, when cool enough to handle, pinch off their skins. You don't have to, but by doing this they will become lovely and sweet when cooked, and their intense flavours will infuse the potatoes. By now the potatoes will be cooked. Drain them in a colander, then lightly crush them by pushing down on them with your thumb. Pick and bash up most of the oregano leaves with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar, or a Flavour Shaker if you have one. Add 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, a good splash of red wine vinegar and some pepper and give everything another bash. Add to the chicken with the potatoes, the tomatoes and the rest of the oregano leaves. Toss everything together carefully. Spread out in a single layer in the roasting tray, and bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven until golden.

For the mustard sauce, mix the mustard powder, vinegar and a good pinch of salt and pepper together in a little bowl, then sprinkle over the reserved herby fennel tops from the chicken recipe. For the fiery horseradish sauce, peel the horseradish and finely grate into a little bowl with the lemon zest, then squeeze in the juice.

Trim the fennel and chop into 8 wedges, reserving any herby tops for later. Scrub and trim the carrots, roughly chopping the large ones, then peel and quarter the onion, and trim and roughly chop the celery, reserving any delicate yellow leaves. When the time's up on the chicken, tie the herbs together and add to the pot with the bulb of garlic and all the veg, except the peas and broad beans. Cook for 30 minutes, or until the veg are perfectly cooked and the chicken is falling away from the bone. Meanwhile, make the dumplings. Beat the eggs with 5 tablespoons of the reserved chicken fat, then stir in the matzo meal and a pinch of salt and black pepper - the dough should be quite sticky. You want to make about 24 dumplings, so, with wet hands, form 3cm to 4cm balls, placing them on a large tray lined with greaseproof paper as you go. Firm up in the fridge until needed. Once done, carefully transfer the chicken and veg to a large bowl. Pour the broth through a sieve into a large shallow pan (big enough to fit the dumplings in a single layer), then taste and season to perfection. Bring to the boil, then dot in the dumplings. Cook for 5 minutes, then add the noodles, peas and broad beans, and cook for a further 5 minutes. Meanwhile, pull the chicken off the bone in big chunks, discarding any bones and skin, then arrange nicely on a serving platter with all the veg, ladling over a little of the cooking liquor to stop it from drying out.

Pick and finely chop the soft herbs, halve the lemon and tear the bay leaves. Rub inside the chicken cavity with sea salt, then carefully grab the skin at the tip of the chicken breasts, making sure that it doesn't rip, and pull up gently. With your other hand gently separate the skin from the meat of the breast - it's normally connected by a little bit of tissuey-type stuff, and you can either leave this attached in the middle and make two little tunnels either side or you can try to cut away the middle. Sprinkle a little salt down the gaps that you have made, push in most of the chopped herbs and drizzle in a little oil. Push the lemon halves into the cavity along with the bay and rosemary sprigs, then pull the skin of the chicken breast forward so that none of the flesh is exposed, tuck the little winglets under, and tie up as firmly as possible. Rub a little oil all over the chicken skin, scatter over the remaining chopped herbs and season very generously with salt and black pepper. Slash each thigh about 3 or 4 times to allow the heat to penetrate directly. Remove the hot tray from the oven and drizzle with a little oil. Put the chicken into the tray, breast-side down and leaning to one side, then place in the oven. Roast for 5 minutes, then lean it to the other side, still breast-side down. Cook for another 5 minutes, then place the chicken on its bottom and cook for 1 further hour, or until golden and cooked through - the skin should be really crispy and the herbs will flavour the meat- this really must be the best roast chicken.

Peel the garlic, deseed and roughly chop the chillies, finely grate the zest of 1 lemon and place in a pestle and mortar. Add a pinch of sea salt and pound to a paste. To make the dressing, squeeze the juice of the zested lemon into a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of oil, season with salt and black pepper and put in the fridge until needed. Place the chicken wings and prawns on a tray and rub all over with half of the oregano paste, making sure you get it into all the nooks and crannies. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge overnight. Soak the wooden skewers in water before use - this will prevent them from catching on the barbecue. When you're ready to cook, preheat the oven to 160°C/325°F/gas 3, then prepare the barbecue. Carefully place the chicken wings onto the wooden skewers; start at the wing tip and push the meat onto the skewer. Do the same with the prawns; start with the head, pushing the skewer all of the way along the body. Pop the prawns back into the fridge. Place the chicken wings on a large baking tray and cook for 1 hour, or until cooked through. Cut the courgettes into 3cm chunks, then slide them onto the remaining skewers. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil and season with salt and pepper. Remove the dressing from the fridge and let it come up to room temperature. When the coals of your barbecue are glowing and the flames have died down, place the skewers on the grill and cook until golden - this should take about 3 minutes on each side. Serve on a platter, drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle over the reserved oregano. Serve with lemon wedges."

Skim the froth from the surface every so often. Allow it to bubble away for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the chicken is delicious, soft and starting to come away from the bone. To make the tortellini, add the pasta flour and eggs to a food processor along with a little sea salt. Blitz until everything comes together into a dough. If its too dry, add a splash of stock or water. Tip the dough onto a floured surface and knead for a few minutes. Wrap in clingfilm and allow to rest until you are ready for it. Carefully remove the chicken from the broth. Pull the meat from the chicken. Carefully take the breasts from the bird - they will come away very easily - and put to one side. Pull all of the remaining meat from the carcass and shred it for your pasta filling. Add to a bowl. Pick, chop and add the tarragon (saving some of the leaves for later) along with a generous grating of Parmesan. Season with salt and black pepper, and allow to cool.

Use a pasta machine (or floured rolling pin) to roll out 1 piece (covering the rest with clingfilm or a tea towel) intoÂ a long, very thin 10cm-wide strip.Â Slice into 5cm squares. Place 1Â teaspoon of the chicken filling in the middle of a pasta square, then fold the pasta into a triangle, pressing the edges to seal. Wind the folded edge around the tip of your middle finger and press the ends to form a ring. Place on the floured tray. Continue until you have used all the rolled-out dough, then repeat with the rest of the dough. Get the broth to a rolling boil and add the peas and broad beans, and the chicken breasts. Chop the asparagus into 1cm pieces and add those too, followed by your tortellini. You will know when they are done because after a few minutes the tortellini will float to the surface. Divide the carrot and fennel between the serving bowls. Use two forks to shred the chicken breasts and share the meat between the bowls, along with the tortellini, peas and beans. Ladle over the broth and serve topped with tarragon leaves and fine gratings of Parmesan."

Don't go mad as a bit of texture in theÂ glaze is good. In a bowl, scrunch up the remaining onion slices with a pinch of salt and a good splash of vinegar and set aside - this will mellow the onions and they will add an incredible sharpness to cut through the sweetness of the deliciously dark, sticky, shiny glaze. Check the chicken wings are as tender as you like them. Heat a lug of oil in a large frying pan over aÂ high heat, pick in the rosemary leaves and fry until crispy, then transfer to a small dish for later. Keep the pan hot, add the wings and fry until golden. Add the glaze and keep turning the wings to coat them (at this point you can add an extra drizzle of honey, if you like your wings extra sticky). Scatter with the quick-pickled onions and crispy rosemary, then get stuck in! Delicious served with griddled bruschetta, if you like."

Drain in a colander (remove the lemon and set aside for the dressing), leave to steam dry for a couple of minutes, then shake them around a little to create rough edges - this will help to make them nice and crispy. Massage a little olive oil, sea salt and black pepper into the chicken. Halve the remaining lemon, then rub one half over the bird, before popping both halves into the cavity. Place the chicken, breast-side-down, directly on the grills in the middle of the oven - most of the fat is in the back of the bird, so this will allow the juices to run into the breast and keep all of the meat moist. Position a tray on the shelf below to catch the juices (you'll need these for the chips), and roast the chicken for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until cooked through, turning the chicken over after 45 minutes to crisp up the rest of the skin. Once you have 30 minutes of cooking time left, add the parboiled chips and thyme to the tray with the chicken juices, stirring to coat.

Leave the chips in for 5 to 10 minutes, or until crisped up, while the chicken rests. To make the dressing, halve the boiled lemon and scoop the jammy insides into a bowl. Very finely chop half of the skin (avoiding the bitter pith) and add this too. Pick and finely chop the basil and parsley leaves along with the chives. Add to the lemon with the yoghurt. Stir, season and loosen with a little extra virgin olive oil. Set aside. Reserving the bushy tops, finely slice the fennel, finely shred the cabbage and peel the carrots lengthways into ribbons. Add the veg to a large serving bowl, toss through the lemony dressing, then scatter over the saved fennel tops. Herb tops and baby leaves are delicious here too.

Place the caster sugar and golden syrup in a medium heavy-based pan over a low heat. Don't stir, just gently swirl the pan to help dissolve the sugar. Turn up the heat to medium and keep swirling until the sugar turns into a golden caramel. Take the pan off the heat. Discard the vanilla pod from the hot milk, then stir in the caramel with a wooden spoon. Return it to a low heat while you stir in the remaining butter, then remove from the heat and set aside. Scrunch up a large piece of greaseproof paper, make it wet (shake off the excess), then use it to line a 20cm x 30cm baking tin. Pour in the caramel, sprinkle with another pinch of salt, and place it on a tea towel in the fridge for 30 minutes, until you have a thick, gooey caramel. Once the caramel has been chilling for 15 minutes, start the brownies. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Grease and line another 20cm x 30cm baking tin. Melt the butter in a pan over a low heat. Chop and stir in the chocolate until it's melted, then remove from the heat and stir in the sugar. Once cooled slightly, whisk in the eggs, then sift and fold in the flour until incorporated. Pour the mixture into the tin. Take your caramel from the fridge, scoop out spoonfuls and dot them into the brownie mixture, pressing to submerge. Once you have a third of the caramel left, drizzle it on top, using your spoon to ripple it through. Bake the brownies in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until cooked but still a bit gooey. Leave to cool for 1 hour, cut into squares and serve."

Roughly chop and place the marzipan and a little of the cream in the bowl of a standing mixer and beat using the paddle attachment until you have a thick paste. Gradually add the rest of the cream and continue to beat until you have a pale paste. Add 170g of the butter and beat until completely incorporated. Next add the sugar and beat again until the mixture is pale and creamy. Finally, separate and beat in the egg yolks one at a time (save the whites), then the vanilla extract. Finely grate in the orange zest. Sift the self-raising flour and cornflour into a bowl, mix together, then, using a large metal spoon, gradually fold into the cake batter. Whisk the egg whites to firm peaks, then fold into the batter with the large metal spoon, being careful not to knock out too much of the air. Spoon the marmalade into a small pan and melt over a low heat, add a splash of water if needed to loosen, and keep warm. Now to assemble the cake: using a ladle as your measure, spoon just enough batter into the cake tin to cover the base - you'll probably need to fill the ladle to about two-thirds. Use a pastry brush to spread the mixture evenly over the base of the tin, so it just covers the surface, then cook under the grill for 4 minutes, or until set and golden all over. Ladle another thin layer of batter on top, and return to the grill. Once golden, brush a thin layer of the softened marmalade over the cake - you want just enough for a thin glaze. Continue layering and grilling, glazing with marmalade every second or third layer, until the batter is used up - you should get 15 to 18 layers. Brush the top of the cake with a good layer of marmalade, then run a knife around the outside of the cake. Leave to cool, then cover with clingfilm and chill for a few hours, or overnight, to set. A couple of hours before you're ready to serve, break the chocolate into pieces and melt with the remaining 50g butter in a heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of simmering water. Once completely melted and glossy, stir through the rum, then set it aside for 10 minutes to cool. Remove the cake from the tin and set it on a serving plate. Pour on the chocolate sauce and use a spatula to spread it evenly over the top, letting it drizzle down the sides. Leave it to set slightly, then garnish with the toasted flaked almonds, before leaving it to cool completely. Serve with a big mug of tea or a festive sherry.

When the nut brittle is cool, chop or blitz in a processor to small pieces. Sprinkle the pieces of brittle over the top of the finished tart. To decorate with spun sugar, heat the sugar and glucose with 50ml water in the same pan, over a medium heat. Allow the sugar to melt, stir for even texture. Heat for 8 to 10 minutes, until 150°C, then remove and quickly place into an ice bath to stop the process and set aside. Take two forks and pull the sugar out, twirling the forks to make long strands into nests. Alternatively, place a piece of baking paper on your countertop.

To see her teaching me how to make these, watch the video here LINK. Tamales can be sweet, like these, or savoury. They are basically filled Mexican dumplings - I think they're brilliant. The cornhusks they're wrapped in are used throughout Mexico. If you buy corn in season it often comes in husks, but the dried husks I'm using here work a treat. You can pick them up online or at Whole Foods Market stores. Otherwise, things like greaseproof or wax paper will also do the trick. Soak your cornhusks in a bowl of warm water or, if you're using greaseproof paper, cut yourself 16 pieces roughly 12cm x 20cm. In a separate bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, a pinch of sea salt, baking powder, sugar, coconut and chopped pineapple. Add the lime zest and juice and pour in 200ml of water to bring everything together. Mix well, until you've got a thick spoonable paste. Put a large pan of water on to boil - the pan needs to be big enough to fit a colander on top. Take a soaked cornhusk or piece of greaseproof paper and spoon a heaped tablespoon of your pineapple mixture into the middle of the husk or paper; if the husks are thin you might have to layer two on top of each other. Fold the sides in to cover the filling, then twist the ends and use string to tie them so they look like Christmas crackers. Lay your prepared tamales in a large colander or steamer, making sure they're all in one layer and not overlapping. Cover the top of the colander with tin foil and seal it nice and tightly. If you don't have a colander large enough you can always steam the tamales in 2 batches. Pop the colander on top of your pan of boiling water and steam for about 20 to 25 minutes. About 5 minutes before they're due to be ready, start making your chocolate sauce. Gently bring the cream to the boil in a pan on a medium heat. As soon as it starts to boil, take the pan off the heat and stir in your chocolate pieces until they're perfectly melted and combined. Add the cubes of butter and a pinch of salt and stir well until the butter is melted. Open one of the tamales to check that it's perfectly cooked - it should be solid and the wrapping should peel away from it easily. Take them off the heat and let them cool down slightly so they're cool enough to handle but still warm and delicious. Lay them on a platter next to a jug of your warm chocolate sauce and let everyone get involved and unwrap their own."

Pour the cake mixture into the dish, using a spatula to scrape it all out of the processor. Break the fudge into pieces and sprinkle these over the top of the cake mix, pushing any larger pieces down into the mixture. Pop the baking dish into the preheated oven and cook for 18 to 20 minutes. Take the cake out of the oven and stick a fork into the middle of it. If there's a little bit of cake mixture on the fork when you pull it out, that's okay - you want the cake to still be a little moist inside so that it's nice and squidgy. However, if it seems a bit wobbly, pop it back into the oven for another 3 to 5 minutes to firm up a bit. Let your cake cool slightly and serve it warm and gooey. Lovely with a dollop of crÃ¨me fraÃ®che, a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a bit of double cream."

Add the sugar to the bowl of yolks and beat until the sugar has dissolved and its silky and smooth.

In a third bowl, beat the cream until slightly thick and just whipped. Once the chocolate has melted, carefully lift the bowl out of the pan. Add 75ml (3 shots) of amaretto and the cocoa powder to your bowl of yolks and mix well. Tip in the cream and mix again, then fold through the melted chocolate until it's well combined and a gorgeous colour. Finish by tipping in the egg whites, then keep folding, from the outside in in a figure-of-eight until the mix is smooth and evenly coloured.

Spoon or ladle the mousse into a big serving bowl or divide between little glasses or cappuccino cups and pop in the fridge for an hour or two until set. Just before you're ready to serve, give the mousse a lovely dusting of cocoa. Pop your dried cherries in a small pan, add a wineglass of amaretto then top with enough water to cover. Put on the heat and bring to the boil, then turn the heat off and leave to stand for a bit. This will bring the cherries back to life. Leaving them in the packet, bash up your sesame snaps in a pestle and mortar. Tip them out, and break up any larger bits that are left so its nutty with a caramelly kick and a bit of a crunch.

Bring everything to the boil, then turn down to a medium to low heat and stir constantly for about 15 minutes. This combination of flavours will be absolutely beautiful, but you've got to help the dish along by doing your job and making sure each grain of rice gets the same amount of love. So every now and then, stir from the outside of the pan into the middle so you get a sort of pile of rice in the centre, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom. Flatten the pile out with your spoon, then start the whole process again. After 15 minutes the rice should be cooked, but still have a bit of a bite, so add the mussels or clams and the prawns. You may want to add an extra splash of stock here if the rice looks a bit dry. Keep stirring, and as the clams and mussels start to open and the prawns begin to turn pink, add your squid and green beans and cook for a further 5 minutes or so. Discard any clams or mussels that don't open.

Stir together quickly. (No more cooking now, otherwise you'll scramble the eggs.), Get everyone around the table, ready to eat straight away. While you're tossing the pasta and sauce, grate in the rest of the Parmesan and add a little more of the cooking water if needed, to give you a silky and shiny sauce. Taste quickly for seasoning. If you've managed to get any courgette flowers, tear them over the top, then serve and eat immediately, as the sauce can become thick and stodgy if left too long."

You've got to find some Lincolnshire Poacher, it's an amazing cheese made by the very talented Jones brothers, Simon and Tim (see www.lincolnshirepoachercheese.com). The pastry is rich and amazing, so embrace the fact that it's really crumbly and will definitely break as you're making it. I'm serving this with a lemony salad and sweet salt-baked shallots, which will get caramelized and gorgeous and pick up the seasoning from the bed of salt. This method is also a great one for beetroots, so if you like this, try that. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Blitz the flour and butter in a food processor with a pinch of salt and a few good pinches of pepper until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip on to a work surface, make a well in the centre and add 100ml of cold water. Gently mix until it starts to come together, then - most importantly for a short, crumbly pastry - have the confidence to only just press, pat and almost hug it together to form a rough scruffy ball. Please don't be tempted to knead the dough or it won't be short and crumbly. Pop it into a floured bowl, cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge to chill while you make the filling. Put a drizzle of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat and pick in the leaves from half the bunch of thyme. Add a few gratings of nutmeg, the zest of half the lemon, the sliced courgettes and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Cook gently (the courgettes will cook down and become easier to handle), stirring occasionally, for around 25 minutes. Then turn the heat down to low and cook for another 20 minutes, so the courgette mixture becomes dense and the flavours really intensify and sweeten. Allow to cool a little, finely chop and crumble in the cheese, then chop and add the mint leaves. Set aside. Halve the pastry and roll each half into a circle just under 1cm thick and slightly larger than the pie dish you've chosen (roughly 23cm diameter x 4cm deep). Don't worry if the pastry breaks up - that's normal. Just patch it. Roll one of the circles around the rolling pin and carefully unroll it over the pie dish. Gently press the pastry into the corners and sides of the dish, then spoon and spread all your courgette mixture into the dish. Carefully unroll the pastry lid over the top, then flour your thumb and forefinger and gently pinch and crimp the edges together. Trim off any excess pastry and brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg. Now simply throw the rock salt into a roasting tray with the shallots, still with their skins on, and a few thyme tips. Put the pie right at the bottom of the oven, with the tray of shallots above. Cook for 1 hour, or until the pie is golden, then allow to cool and serve with those soft roasted shallots. PS: All the leftover salt from baking the shallots can be bashed up and reused."

You may have difficulty getting hold of it, but if you can find it you'll be using it all the time - it has an unusual flavour half-way between rice and couscous (this recipe will also work well with both of these). In Italy it was a major food for the ancient Romans, who used it to make bread, porridge and soup before they got hold of wheat. Nowadays it's used in salads, soups, stews, even pastas. You should be able to buy farro in good Italian delis, and supermarkets have started to stock it in the special selection aisles. Here's a recipe for one of my fave salads - give it a go. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Soak the farro or bulgar wheat in cold water for 20 minutes, then drain. Slice the courgettes across into chunky half-moons and put them into a large roasting tray. Add the remaining vegetables and the garlic cloves and toss together with a good splash of olive oil. Season with pepper and a tiny pinch of salt. Try to spread the vegetables out in one layer, as they'll roast better this way (use 2 trays if you have to). Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, removing the trays and carefully shaking them now and then, until the vegetables are cooked through and crisp around the edges. Sprinkle a little vinegar over the vegetables as soon as they come out of the oven and set aside to cool. When cool, tip on to a large chopping board, add the fresh herbs and chop finely. Place the farro or bulgar wheat in a large saucepan, cover with fresh cold water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender, and drain well. Dress with olive oil and the lemon juice, season with salt and pepper, and toss with the roasted herby vegetables. Scatter over the reserved fennel tops and serve."

It's great because it's a nice little side dish that will go with things like mozzarella, goat's cheese, cured meats, grilled or barbecued white fish like cod or haddock, even things like chicken or pork. Use courgettes when at their best (nice and firm and not too big). Slice 4 courgettes lengthways as thin as you can (use a mandolin if you have one). Grill on a red-hot griddle pan, or on the barbecue, until lightly charred on each side. Scatter the slices over a large plate, making sure you don't sit them on top of each other otherwise they'll steam and go a bit limp, and there's nothing worse than limp courgettes, I can tell you. While they're still warmish, sprinkle them with a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Deseed a red chilli and chop finely. Finely chop Â½ a clove of garlic and sprinkle the chilli and garlic evenly from a height over the courgettes. (Add to your own taste, but just remember that when the chilli and garlic mix with the olive oil and lemon juice the heat and flavours are lessened.), Tear over a handful of fresh mint and drizzle with good extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon. I've even been known to throw in some blanched broad beans or raw peas if I can get any. This salad is always a real treat. P.S. If you find yourself with leftovers, try baking any fish fillets (cod, haddock or bass for example) on top of the courgettes. Lovely with steamed rice and seasoned yoghurt. Very fresh and good for you."

If you like, a mint sauce would make a great accompaniment. Pretty delish!, Preheat the oven to 200°C. Place the chicken on a board and make some deep crisscross slashes into the legs - this will help the spices to penetrate the meat, and will also help it to cook more quickly. Halve the lemon and place inside the chicken, then rub the chicken skin all over with olive oil, a little sea salt, pepper and the cumin. Transfer the chicken to a roasting tray and place in the hot oven. Peel and quarter the onions and carrots. When the chicken's been cooking for around 15 minutes, reduce the heat to 180°C and add the onions and carrots to the tray. Roast for a further hour, or until golden and cooked through - the chicken is cooked when the thigh meat pulls easily away from the bone and the juices run clear. Once perfectly cooked, carefully lift the chicken onto a plate or board and cover with tin foil and a couple of tea towels to keep warm. Spoon the vegetables onto a board and roughly chop them, then tip back into the tray and place on a medium heat. Pour in 500ml boiling water and stir well, making sure you scrape up all the lovely sticky goodness from the bottom of the tray. Drain and roughly chop the peppers, then add them to the tray with the smoked paprika, ground coriander and the couscous. Pull the lemon halves out of the chicken with a pair of tongs and squeeze the juices into the tray (making sure to catch any pips). Bring to the boil, then turn the heat off and leave to rest for 5 minutes, or until the couscous has absorbed all of the water. Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the mint leaves. When the time's up, fluff up the couscous using a fork and stir through the chopped mint. Drizzle with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and everything together. Cut the chicken up into joints, removing the skin if you want to keep it healthy, then serve with the tasty roast-vegetable couscous. Enjoy!, Jamie's Tip: Basting a chicken as it cooks helps to stop it drying out, giving you lovely, juicy meat. Check on the chicken every 20 to 30 minutes, and spoon any juices from the bottom of the tray back over the bird."

Make sure the sea bass fillets are halved and the skin of both the sea bass and the red mullet is slashed with a sharp knife. Chop a few of the parsley and mint leaves and stuff them into the slashes - this looks pretty, flavours the fish and helps to crisp up the skin. Place all the fish and shellfish into a bowl, drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil, season and mix together. Spoon the couscous into a roasting tray or ovenproof dish. Spread it out, then arrange the fish and shellfish over the top, in a single layer. Make sure the fillets are placed skin-side up. Drizzle over the remaining lemon juice, a little more olive oil and sprinkle with half of the lemon zest. Cut the remaining 2 lemons in half and put on top of the couscous.

Omega 3 refers to all the lovely goodness that you get from oily fish like red mullet, sardines and fresh anchovies, so do feel free to use any one of these, or a mixture of them. This is also great served with linguine pasta instead of couscous. First of all, lay your fish out in one layer on your worktop to give you an idea of how much you are dealing with. Next get yourself a pan with a lid - ideally one that's the right size for the fish to be spread out in one layer. This is so that it can all cook at the same time. Put your pan on the heat, add 4 or 5 tablespoons of olive oil, and slowly fry your onions, fennel, chilli, fennel seeds and bay leaf with the lid on until nice and softened. This should take about 10 minutes. Meanwhile put your couscous in a bowl and just cover it with salted, boiling water. Put to one side to soak for about 5 minutes. When the onions are sweet and soft, add the tomatoes and anchovies, stir together and carefully season to taste. Shake the pan so that the onions and tomatoes cover the bottom of the pan evenly. Dress the couscous lightly with a little olive oil and the juice and zest of one of the lemons. Sprinkle the couscous over the top of the onions and tomatoes in one even layer. Then place the fish over the top of that and finish off with a drizzle of olive oil. Place the lid on top and simmer slowly on the hob for about 12 minutes. Meanwhile, season the yoghurt with salt, pepper and the remaining lemon juice and sprinkle over the reserved fennel tops and mint.

Meanwhile, peel the garlic and place in a food processor with the reserved duck skin. Tear in the bread, strip in the thyme leaves, then blitz until fine. Tip into a frying pan on a medium heat with Â½ a tablespoon of olive oil and fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp, stirring regularly. Decant into a small bowl. Make the Royal pasta dough. Once it's relaxed for 30 minutes, roll out on a clean flour-dusted surface into a rectangle roughly Â½cm thick. Using a sharp knife, cut it into long Â½cm strips, then with lightly oiled fingers gently roll each strip into a long thin sausage shape, starting at the middle and carefully rolling outwards, placing them on a semolina-dusted tray as you go. When the ragÃ¹ has around 10 minutes to go, cook the pici in a large pan of boiling salted water for 6 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain, reserving a cupful of cooking water. Toss the pici with the ragÃ¹, adding a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a little reserved cooking water to loosen, if needed. Divide between bowls, then grate over some Parmesan, sprinkle over the pangrattato, and serve."

Grate half the nutmeg and zest both oranges. Cut the oranges in half and set aside for stuffing the duck. Put everything on a board with one tablespoon of sea salt and chop it all up. Rub the mixture all over the ducks, inside and out. Cover and leave in the fridge for a few hours or overnight to let the flavours penetrate. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 and arrange the shelves on the middle and bottom levels. Stuff the ducks with the remaining rosemary sprigs, garlic cloves and reserved orange halves. Peel and quarter the onions, then trim and roughly chop the celery and carrots. Peel and chop the ginger. Scatter the veg and ginger in the bottom of a large, deep-sided roasting tray with the cinnamon and bay leaves. Roughly chop the reserved duck neck and giblets and add to the mix. Place the ducks breast-side up, straight on to the bars of the middle shelf, then pop the veg-filled roasting tray on the bottom shelf beneath the ducks ready to catch all the lovely fat that drips out of them. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into chunks. Pop them in a pan and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a simmer and parboil for 5 to 10 minutes, then tip into a colander and chuff them up a little. After the duck has roasted for an hour, take the bottom tray out of the oven, replacing it immediately with an empty tray. Spoon the fat from the veggie tray into a bowl. Put all the veg, duck bits and juices into a large saucepan, then add a little boiling water to the tray to get all the sticky brown bits off the bottom - this is what you're going to make your gravy with. Tip the water and brown bits into the pan with the veg, top up with 1 litre of water or chicken stock and place on a medium heat, skimming off any of the fat that rises to the top. Put your parboiled potatoes into the empty tray in the oven. Add a few more tablespoons of duck fat from the bowl, season, and place back underneath the ducks to cook for an hour. Meanwhile, heat a saucepan and add 2 tablespoons of duck fat. When it's hot and melted, add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon until you have a paste. Stir in the contents of the saucepan and the Port. Bring the gravy to the boil and simmer gently for half an hour, stirring occasionally. By now the ducks will have had 2 hours in the oven and will be done. Lift them on to a plate, cover loosely with tin foil and leave to rest for about 15 minutes. Pour the gravy through a sieve into a clean saucepan, pressing down on all the veg and other bits to extract as many flavours and juices as you can. Keep the gravy warm in the saucepan, again skimming off any fat on the surface. When you're ready to dish up - don't carve the ducks! The best thing to do is to pull the meat away from the bones with a pair of tongs or with your fingers wearing clean kitchen gloves, then let everyone fight over the delicious skin. Serve with your potatoes and gravy."

Once cool, cut the duck into 4 portions by carefully cutting off the breasts and legs, discarding the carcass. Place in a tall, sterilised jar and push down on the duck to make it a compact layer. Pour the duck fat over the duck, ensuring it is completely covered and seal the jar. Store in the fridge for up to two weeks.

Place the duck in an oven heated to 200°C/400°F/gas 6 for 20 minutes or until crisp and tender. I love serving my duck with noodles. All that needs doing is to bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Add the pak choi, sugar snaps and noodles and cook for 4 minutes.

Bizarrely enough, the fact that my parents ran a pub restaurant meant that we very rarely went out for dinner as a family, but when we did, my old man used to take us out to this Chinese restaurant in Sawbridgeworth where we all fell in love with Peking duck. There are hundreds of ways of cooking duck in Asian cultures - steamed, roasted, pumped up with bicycle pumps to remove the meat from the skin - but we're at home and so we can't do with all this mucking about. My way is simple and it works... Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3. Rub a nice 1.2kg duck with loads of salt, inside and out. Dust the bird all over with five-spice and, if you've got any, grate some fresh ginger and rub it round the cavity, leaving the ginger inside to flavour. Place the duck in a roasting tray and put it in the oven. All you need to do is check on it every so often and spoon away the excess fat that has rendered out of the duck. This will make the skin go wonderfully crispy. Generally, after a couple of hours it will be perfect - the leg meat will pull off the bone and the skin will be wonderfully crisp. You don't always need to, but I sometimes turn the heat up to 200°C/400°F/gas 6 for a short while until it's really crispy. While this beautiful bird is cooking, you can make your plum sauce. Chuck 10 or 12 destoned plums into a pan with 5 tablespoons of sugar, a couple of pinches of five-spice, a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce, half a teaspoon of chilli powder and a splash of water. Bring to the boil, then simmer until you get a nice shiny pulp. You can remove the plum skins if you want to, but I usually leave them in. Sometimes I add a little grated orange zest, as this goes well with duck. Put the sauce to one side to cool before serving it, and taste to check the seasoning. As for the spring onions and cucumber, that's straightforward. Use half a cucumber and a bunch of spring onions and finely slice them. I strongly advise buying a couple of packs of pre-made pancakes which you can place in a steamer or microwave and slowly steam until nice and hot. The bamboo steamers are only a few quid from Chinese supermarkets, so it's worth getting hold of some and they're great to serve at the table. Once the duck has cooled a little bit, use two forks to shred all the meat off the carcass. I remember the Chinese lady at the restaurant in Sawbridgeworth doing this. You can do the same, putting all the meat with its crispy skin on to a serving plate. Take a pancake, place some duck, a bit of spring onion, a little cucumber and a dollop of plum sauce on to it, then roll it up - lovely."

Drain on kitchen paper and allow to cool in a bowl. Dice and add the ham, grate in the GruyÃ¨re cheese and mix well. Spread evenly over the cooled pastry case. Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Whisk the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che, eggs, egg yolks, milk and nutmeg together in a bowl and season generously. Carefully pour the mixture into the pastry case. Bake the quiche in the oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the filling has set and the top is beginning to turn golden. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the tin. For the carrot and parsley salad, grate the carrots, pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, then combine with the oil and lemon juice in a bowl. Season generously.

You could also make smaller waffles, if you prefer - you'll need to do 2 at a time. Lower the heat to medium-low and cook the waffles for around 6 minutes, or until lightly golden on the bottom. Flip over and continue to cook for around 6 minutes, until golden and cooked through. (It can be tricky to flip a whole waffle, but be bold and go for it - if it breaks, don't worry, you can rock the rustic look.), Give the waffle an extra couple of minutes on each side to crisp up, then serve them with your toppings.

Beat the egg with the milk, then add the mixture and gently work it together until it forms a ball of dough. Remember not to work the pastry too much at this stage or it will become elastic and chewy, not crumbly and short.

Pour in the tomatoes, using a spoon or potato masher to break them up. Bring to the boil, then turn down to a medium heat and cook for a further 5 minutes to reduce the sauce. When you've got a nice thick tomato stew consistency, have a taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed. Slice the fresh tomatoes and lay them over the top of the mixture. Use a spoon to make small wells in the tomato stew, then crack in the eggs so they poach in the thick, delicious juices - try to crack them in as quickly as you can so they all get to cook for roughly the same amount of time. Season from a height, put the lid on and let the eggs cook for around 3 to 4 minutes, or until cooked to your liking. Warm the tortillas while this is happening. You can pop them into the oven at 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for a few minutes, microwave them for a few seconds or even lay them over the lid of the pan so they heat up as the eggs cook. Take the lid off and check your eggs by giving them a poke with your finger. When they're done to your liking, turn the heat off and take the pan to the table with the warmed tortillas, the Cheddar and a grater so everyone can get involved and make their own.

Louisiana bayous have a sort of wild, swampy charm about them that I love. Wild pecan trees grow along the banks, so there's no shortage of this delicious nut. Another ingredient. Louisiana has in abundance is molasses, thanks to the fields and fields of sugar cane. I've used both these ingredients to make this beautiful, and quintessentially Southern, dessert. Molasses can be found in health food shops and all good supermarkets - it's worth getting your hands on some if you can. Start by making the pastry, adding the optional vanilla seeds and orange zest from the list of ingredients. Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Take half your pecans and put them inside a clean tea towel or in a sandwich bag. Use a rolling pin to bash them up finely. After the pastry has had 30 minutes in the fridge, continue through the method of the sweet pastry recipe until baked blind. To make the filling, use a whisk to mix the eggs, sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. Add your finely bashed pecans and mix again with a spoon until completely blended and smooth. Add the molasses, melted butter and bourbon, mix well, then fold in your reserved whole pecans. Pour this mixture into the pastry case. Put the tart into the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the filling starts setting at the sides. Remove and leave to cool in its tin for an hour (if you can wait that long), to really help it set, before serving. I think a slice of slightly warm pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream is absolute heaven."

Put the flour and breadcrumbs into 2 separate bowls, so you have 3 bowls in total. Carefully put the quail's eggs into a small pan. Once the kettle boils, pour in the boiling water straight away and cook for 2 minutes, no longer. Move the pan to the sink and run cold water over the eggs for 2 to 3 minutes. Tap, roll and - ever so gently - peel the shells off them. Do it under running water if it helps. You'll get quicker at peeling them as you go. Take a marble-sized piece of sausage meat and flatten it out in the palm of your clean hand until it's about 6cm in diameter. Pop an egg into the middle, then carefully shape and mould the sausage meat up around the egg with your floured hands. You need to get into the routine of pulling up the sides, gently squeezing, moulding, patting and very gently squashing the meat around the egg. Repeat with all 12 eggs, then coat them well with flour. Transfer them to the bowl of beaten egg and coat well, then roll them in the breadcrumbs. They'll be more robust to hold now, so pat and hug them into shape. When they're all done, put them into a container and pop them into the fridge until needed. When you're ready to cook, put a deep casserole-type pan on a medium-high heat and fill it about 8cm deep with vegetable oil. Make sure you never fill a pan more than halfway up. Add a piece of potato to help you gauge the temperature - it's ready once the potato turns golden and floats (or when the oil reaches 180°C on a thermometer). Carefully lower one wee Scotch egg into the pan. After about 4 minutes it should be golden and perfectly cooked through, so take it out of the pan and cut it in half to see if you should have cooked it for less or more time - once you know where you stand, you can cook the rest, in batches of 6 or less.

Even if you've never made pastry before, as long as you stick to the correct measurements for the ingredients and you follow the method exactly, you'll be laughing. The one place where you can experiment is with flavouring. If you don't fancy using lemon zest, try another dry ingredient like orange zest instead. Or a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg or cocoa powder. Vanilla seeds are great too. Just remember to be subtle and don't go overboard with any of these flavours!, Try to be confident and bring the pastry together as quickly as you can - don't knead it too much or the heat from your hands will melt the butter. A good tip is to hold your hands under cold running water beforehand to make them as cold as possible. That way you'll end up with a delicate, flaky pastry every time. Sieve the flour from a height on to a clean work surface and sieve the icing sugar over the top. Using your hands, work the cubes of butter into the flour and sugar by rubbing your thumbs against your fingers until you end up with a fine, crumbly mixture. This is the point where you can spike the mixture with interesting flavours, so mix in your lemon zest. Add the eggs and milk to the mixture and gently work it together till you have a ball of dough. Flour it lightly. Don't work the pastry too much at this stage or it will become elastic and chewy, not crumbly and short. Flour your work surface and place the dough on top.

To make the spice cure, zest the orange, trim the chilli and peel the shallot. Blitz the orange zest, allspice, cinnamon, chilli, treacle and shallot in a food processor until you have a smooth paste. Transfer this to a bowl and stir in the rock salt and sugar. Pour in the 2 tablespoons of rum and mix well. Lay a large double layer of greaseproof paper over a baking tray and place the salmon on it, skin-side down. Slowly pour over the spice cure and use a spatula to spread it all over the salmon. Wrap the fish in both layers of the paper, then tightly in clingfilm. Place in the fridge with something heavy on top to weigh it down, then leave for 48 hours. When the time is up, take the salmon out of the fridge and carefully unwrap it. Rinse off the cure with the 50ml of rum (or you can use cold water), holding the salmon over a baking tray and pouring over a splash at a time. Use a spoon to gently push the cure off the fish. It should have shared its wonderful flavours with the salmon and turned it a dark brownish pink. For the herb cure, pick and finely chop all the herbs and mix together in a bowl. Clean the baking tray and cover with two layers of paper as before, then place the salmon on it, skin-side down. Using your hands, pack the herby cure onto the fish, covering all of the flesh - you don't want air getting in. As before, wrap it with the two layers of greaseproof paper, then a tight layer of clingfilm. Pop it back in the fridge with weights on top and leave for another 24 hours. The next day, your salmon will be perfectly cured and ready to eat. You don't need to rinse off that second cure - simply slice the salmon diagonally, as thinly as you like, then serve with pickled carrots, chillies, and buttered slices of bread."

Use a slotted spoon to remove the salt cod to a plate. Pick out any bones, then break the flesh into the onion pan, also adding a good splash of poaching liquid. Cook for a further 10 minutes on a low heat, or until the fish is soft and flaking apart, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat off. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes, then finely slice into matchsticks using a mandolin (use the guard!) or a sharp knife. Just under half fill a sturdy pan with the vegetable oil - the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full - and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it's ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden - that's the sign that it's ready to go. Working in batches, use a slotted spoon to carefully lower the potato matchsticks into the hot oil to cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until very lightly golden, but not cooked through. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain and repeat. Return the cod mixture to a medium heat, then stir in most of the remaining chopped parsley. Beat the eggs, then gently stir them into the pan. Fold in three-quarters of the potato matchsticks and take the pan off the heat - the eggs will continue to cook in the pan, so make sure you don't overcook them at this stage. Return the remaining potato matchsticks to the hot oil to fry for a further 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain, and season with sea salt. Transfer the bacalhau to a serving dish and top with the crispy potato fries. Using a slotted spoon, spoon over the marinated olives, then sprinkle the remaining chopped parsley on top. Great served with a green salad and a cold glass of dry white wine."

Traditionally this dish has been made with the locally caught redfish, but it's also great with any whole or filleted white fish. It goes with so many things, including chicken, pork, lamb and steak. When I was in Louisiana I cooked it on a barbecue, but I've shown you below how to do it indoors in a pan. Don't be scared by how black the spices go: they'll look burnt but the taste will be amazing. To make the rub, bash up your fresh herbs and garlic in a pestle and mortar until you've got a nice coarse paste. Mix in the spices, 1 teaspoon of sea salt, 1 level tablespoon of black pepper and the olive oil, then squeeze in the juice of half the lemon, making sure not to let any pips get in there, and stir well. Lightly score the skin of your fish in lines about 2cm apart. Using your fingers, smear the rub all over both sides of the fish and into the cuts you've made. Put a non-stick pan or griddle pan over a medium-high heat and let it get nice and hot. Place your fish in the pan, skin side down, and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes. It will get quite smoky, so you might want to open a window! Turn the heat down to low, then, very carefully, flip your fish over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side. Cut your remaining lemon half and your second lemon into wedges for squeezing over. Serve them with your fish, a nice salad and boiled or steamed new potatoes dressed in good olive oil or butter. Don't forget a nice cold glass of wine!"

Add the chillies, garlic, a good pinch of salt and a good splash of vinegar, then cook over a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it coats the back of a spoon. For a smooth syrupy texture, whiz the sauce in a food processor if you like, or leave it finely chopped, then put to one side. Place a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep saucepan over a medium-high heat (roughly 180°C). Fill three-quarters full with vegetable oil and leave to heat up. Meanwhile, wash and pat dry the squid. Slice the tubes horizontally into rings or slice and open them out, then halve lengthways and cut a crisscross pattern onto the surface. Place the squid onto a large plate, along with the prawns, making sure any black bits have been removed. Finely grate over the zest of the limes and squeeze over most of the juice, then toss to coat. Place the flour and a good pinch of salt and pepper into a large bowl, then add the squid and prawns and toss to coat (you'll need to do this in batches). To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a piece of bread into the pan - if the bread floats to the surface, sizzles and turns golden, it's about right. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower the prawns and squid into the hot oil and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden and crisp on the outside and cooked through (you'll need to do this in batches). Transfer the cooked prawns and squid to a double-layer of kitchen paper, then repeat with the remaining seafood. When the last batch of seafood is almost done, squeeze a little lime juice over the parsley sprigs, then dip into the flour and lower into the oil for a few seconds - be careful as it'll spit. Serve the crispy squid and prawns straight away, with crispy lime-spiked parsley, lemon wedges for squeezing over and the sweet chilli sauce on the side for dipping. Keep any leftover chilli sauce in sterilised bottles and store for up to 2 months in a cool dry place."

Using a sharp knife, make 6 slashes on each side of the fish, about 2cm deep and at an angle. Sprinkle salt and pepper into each incision,  stuff each with a pinch of the lemon-herb mix, then smooth flat. Drizzle the fish lightly with olive oil, then lay on top of the potatoes and fennel. Slice up one of the lemons, then stuff into the cavity with the remaining herbs. Bake the fish in the screaming hot oven for 15 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 and cook for a further 30 minutes. To check if the fish is cooked, take a clean skewer and push it into the deepest part of the fish, just behind the head. Count to 10, then carefully take the skewer out and hold it against your top lip -if it's nice and warm, the fish is cooked.

Roasted fennel and potatoes are a magic combination, as are the fresh herbs and salmon. Scoring and stuffing the salmon is a great little trick you can use on any type of fish. Preheat your oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Halve the potatoes lengthways and trim the fennel bulb, reserving the leafy fronds for garnishing later. Cut the fennel bulb into eight wedges, add these to the salted water with the halved potatoes and parboil for around 6 minutes. Drain the vegetables in a colander and leave to steam-dry for a minute. Transfer to a large roasting tray and season well with salt and pepper. Sprinkle over half the chopped parsley and all of the garlic, dot over the butter and drizzle well with olive oil. Toss everything together in the roasting tray, then shake it out so it is in one even layer. Cook in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until golden. While the vegetables are roasting away in the oven, you can start preparing the salmon fillets. Pinch the fillets so they plump up and use the length of a knife to score the skin side of them. You want to score about 1cm down into them. Not only will this help all the lovely flavours get right into the fish, it will also help it cook more quickly. Season both sides of the fish well and stuff the remaining chopped parsley and the mint leaves into the scores. Mint goes brilliantly with oily fish, such as salmon. Once the potatoes are nice and golden, take them out of the oven and sprinkle the grated Parmesan over them. Give everything a bit of a jiggle, then lay the salmon, skin-side up, on top. Sprinkle the lemon zest over the top, drizzle with olive oil then cook for 15 minutes. Just before the salmon comes out of the oven, chop the reserved fennel fronds. Sprinkle them over the finished dish, then serve it in the middle of the table with some wedges of lemon and let everyone tuck in."

Make sure you get really fresh tuna - it needs to be red and almost waxy-looking. You can try using different fish, such as salmon, bream or scallops, just make sure they're all really nice and fresh and smell of nothing but the sea. Get your tuna, and with a long sharp knife slice it as thinly as you can. Once you've sliced it, you can smooth it over with the side of your knife to make it even thinner. Divide this in one layer between your plates, or it's even nicer to serve it on one big plate. Next, use this brilliant Japanese trick: cut a V-shaped vertical slit in the mooli and stuff the chilli in. This means that when you grate it you get a pink-coloured, chilli-flavoured radish pulp, which is fantastic. If you haven't got mooli you can get the same effect by finely chopping the chilli and grating normal radishes. So, either grate or chop your mooli or radish and then blob it and its juice over the tuna slices and sprinkle over the shiso or coriander. When you serve it squeeze half a lime and a couple of teaspoons of soy sauce over each portion, to taste, then drizzle with a little olive oil. * Shiso is a Japanese herb with a strong flavour reminiscent of aniseed."

First of all give your fish a wash, then with a sharp knife score across each fish down to the bone at 2.5cm/1 inch intervals on both sides. This allows flavour to penetrate the fish and lets the fish's juices come out. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Get yourself a bowl and add the tomatoes, garlic, oregano or basil, spring onions, balsamic vinegar, a pinch of salt and pepper and the zest and juice of 1 lemon to it. Loosen with a couple of good tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and mix well, then spread over the bottom of a large roasting tray. Use one that will fit all 4 fish quite snugly (or you can use two smaller trays). Place the fish on top - top to tail. Now add the olives, parsley, juice and zest of the second lemon to the bowl that the tomatoes were in. Loosen with a little olive oil and then divide this mixture between the fish, placing an equal amount on the centre of each. Cook in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the fish. To check whether they're done, take the tip of a knife and push it into the thickest part of the fish. When done, the flesh will easily pull away from the bone. Once cooked, remove the fish from the oven and allow them to rest for 3 or 4 minutes while you get your guests round the table, serve them some wine and dress your salad. Then you can come back to the fish. Divide them up at the table on to 4 plates, making sure that everyone gets some tomatoes and juice spooned over the top of the fish. Lovely!"

I've seen them made in Sicily in the same way, using a mixture of swordfish and tuna - not jarred or tinned tuna though. These have to be made with fresh fish and they are subtly seasoned with Sicilian herbs and spices - this recipe is just as good as the meat versions!, First make your sauce. Place a large pan on the heat, add a good lug of olive oil, your onion and garlic and fry slowly for 10 or so minutes until soft. Add your oregano, the tomatoes, salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Simmer for 15 minutes or so, then liquidize until smooth. Taste - it might need a tiny swig of red wine vinegar or some extra seasoning. While the tomatoes are simmering, chop the tuna up into 2.5cm/1 inch dice. Pour a good couple of tablespoons of olive oil into a large frying pan and place on the heat. Add the tuna to the pan with the pine nuts and cinnamon. Season lightly with salt and pepper and fry for a minute or so to cook the tuna on all sides and toast the pine nuts. Remove from the heat and put the mixture into a bowl. Allow to cool down for 5 minutes, then add the oregano, parsley, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, eggs, and zest and juice of the lemon to the bowl. Using your hands, really scrunch and mix the flavours into the tuna, then divide the mixture and squeeze it into meatballs slightly smaller than a golf ball. If you dip one of your hands in water while shaping you'll get a nice smooth surface on the meatball. If the mixture's very sticky, add a few more breadcrumbs. Keep the meatballs around the same size and place them on an oiled tray, then put them in the fridge for an hour to let them rest. Put the pan you fried the tuna in back on the heat with a little olive oil. Add your meatballs to the pan and jiggle them about until they're golden brown all over. You might want to do them in batches - when they're done, add them to the tomato sauce, divide between your plates, sprinkle with chopped parsley and drizzle with good olive oil. Great served with spaghetti or linguine."

Divide into 4, shape and squash into patties, then chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to firm up. Preheat your barbecue or griddle pan to high. Brush the burgers all over with a little oil and season lightly with sea salt and black pepper. Grill the burgers for 2 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking - the cooking time will depend on how thick you make them. It's OK to eat them when they're still a little pink inside, but if you want to cook them through, go ahead. Trim and separate the lettuce leaves, and slice the tomatoes into rounds. Halve the ciabatta rolls or burger buns, then toast the lightly on the barbecue or griddle. To assemble, place a hot tuna pattie into the toasted roll or bun, then layer up with some lettuce leaves, rocket and sliced tomato.

Take the top shelf out of the oven and place a baking tray on the middle shelf. Tear off a metre of kitchen foil. Fold it in half so it's double thickness, then fold it in half again. You should end up with what looks like a big, foil birthday card. Make two of these then lay them opened and flat on your table. Each foil wrap will hold one piece of fish - you can do a big one for four or a slightly smaller version for two. In a pestle and mortar, bash your lime leaves until they break down and all the flavour comes out. Then add the lemon grass and do the same again. Do this for a couple of minutes... it's worth every second. Then add the garlic, chilli, grated ginger and all of the coriander stalks. Once this is all smashed to a pulp, add the soy sauce, the lime zest and juice and the olive old. Mix well, then taste and correct the seasoning with extra soy sauce as you see fit. Lightly score the sea bass on the skin side with a sharp knife and then rub them with the lime-ginger-lemon grass mix. Allow to marinate for an hour, if you have time, or you can cook it all straight away. Lightly brush the foil edges with a little beaten egg white - this helps to seal the parcel when you fold it up and keeps all the flavoured steam inside to cook the fish. Put the portions of sea bass, skin-side up on one side of each envelope. Divide the marinade and all the juice between the two packages and tuck some coriander into the slits of each piece of fish. Fold over the foil, then fold up two sides of the envelopes securely. Just before you seal the final side of the foil bags, divide the sake between the two envelopes, taking care so that it doesn't dribble out. Pucker and bend the folded sides up so that the juices can't cook out. Don't fold the foil right up to the edge of the fish - leave about 2 inches (5 cm) of space all round the fillets to let the steam circulate. I know all this sounds like a bit of a palaver, but it's actually dead simple. Place straight on to the hot tray and cook for about 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Once cooked, allow to sit for 2-3 minutes. Serve the bags at the table - just cut them open and carefully lift out the fish. You can spoon the juices over it (but don't eat the bits from the marinade as they're really only there for flavour). I like to serve this with a bowl of coriander-flavoured rice or noodles, cooked simply. You're going to love it."

Place the buttered muffin halves on individual plates and cover each one with a spoonful of scrambled egg. Drape a slice of salmon over each muffin half, dollop some soured cream on top and sprinkle with chopped chives and a twist of black pepper. Serve with your lemon wedges and a nice cup of tea - or a glass of something fizzy. Tip: To make things easier, toast your muffins first and keep them warm in the oven."

Wars and battles were won on salt cod because, of course, in the old days ships were sailing for weeks or months and the sailors would have a very unhealthy diet. Having salt cod on board as a source of protein kept them going, and it meant they could jump off the boat with enough energy for a bit of fighting when it was required! All kinds of cultures began to salt fish - I suppose Iberian and Nordic countries are particularly well known for still doing it today. And certainly the Italians are more than partial to their fair share of it. Hundreds of years ago the only way to get fish into the centre of Italy would have been to use preserved fish like salt cod. It might sound obvious, but this is why Tuscan cooking is predominantly meat- and bean-based. In the old days the only common fish recipes would have used either preserved or fresh lake fish. Unless you live in a country where it's prevalent, like Portugal or Spain, salt cod can only be bought in good delis. Try to hunt out the real baccalÃ , but if you can't find any then simply buy some fresh fish which can be salted overnight. As salt cod is preserved using copious amounts of salt, avoid seasoning this soup at all or do it right at the very end. If using fresh cod, haddock or monkfish, pack it in a few handfuls of sea salt overnight and rinse it before using. If using proper salt cod, soak the fillets in cold water for 24 hours, changing the water a few times during this period. This way, the fish will rehydrate and the saltiness will be removed before cooking. If the fish is more than 2cm thick it might need up to 36 hours' soaking. Chop the onion, carrots, celery, garlic and parsley stalks. Heat a splash of olive oil in a saucepan, and add the chopped vegetables, parsley stalks and dried chilli. Sweat very slowly with the lid ajar for 15 to 20 minutes until soft, but not brown. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, then add the stock and bring back to the boil. Break up any larger pieces of tomato with a wooden spoon and drop the salt cod fillets into the hot soup. Simmer gently for 15 minutes, just until the fish has poached and flakes apart when prodded with a fork. Pick out any bits of skin. Gently fold the flakes of fish through the soup, taste and season with pepper, salt (if needed) and a little lemon juice. Chop the parsley and celery leaves and scatter over the soup. Drizzle with plenty of extra virgin olive oil."

We would catch them, then go straight back to his pub and grill them with a little bit of butter. I liked to eat them with fried potatoes with onions â€” so good â€” and a nice squeeze of lemon juice. I came up with this recipe using preserved artichoke hearts from my local deli. In the picture I've used one large 8lb trout, but it works just as well if you use individual trout fillets. Salmon trout or salmon are both good too. Ask your fishmonger to scale, gut and fillet the fish for you. Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7 and rub a roasting tray with a little olive oil. Lay 4 of the trout fillets, skin side down, on the tray, with a few bits of string under each fillet. Lightly toast the almonds in the oven for a couple of minutes - watch them carefully as they don't take long - then bash them up using a pestle and mortar (or a metal bowl and a rolling pin). Try to get some powdery and some chunks. Put the almonds into a bowl and rip in the mint. Take the crusts off the ciabatta and whiz it up in a food processor or chop up. Add the lemon zest, chopped garlic, artichoke hearts, and 5 tablespoons of olive oil to the bowl with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Mix it up well and sprinkle a good handful of the mix over each trout fillet. Place the other 4 fillets on top of the breadcrumb mix, skin side up, laying a bacon rasher along the top of each one, and secure with the string. Sprinkle the thyme over the top and any excess filling around the tray. Place in the middle of the preheated oven and cook for about 15 minutes, until the trout is golden and crisp. Season the yoghurt generously with salt and pepper and add a little lemon juice. When the fish is ready, cut the string and serve the fillets with a nice drizzle of yoghurt and a green salad. Give everyone a lemon half on their plate so they can squeeze the juice over their fish."

With a sharp knife, slice the fish as finely as you can and put it into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper. Finely grate the zest of the limes into a separate bowl and put aside then squeeze all of the lime juice over the fish. The acid of the lime will start to cook the fish so you'll see it start to change colour. Remove the seeds from the pomegranate halves by holding them one at a time, cut-side down, in the palm of your hand over a bowl, and bashing the back with a wooden spoon. The seeds will tumble out between your fingers into the bowl below.

Shake the fillets so any excess breadcrumbs fall off then add to the pan, skin-side down. If you're cooking fish fingers, they'll need 5 to 6 minutes; a whole fillet will take 7 to 8 minutes.

Balance the flavours with pepper and, if necessary, salt and a little more red wine vinegar. Put your new potatoes into a large pan of salted, boiling water and cook for 12 minutes with the lid on. Put the sole fillets into a clean plastic bag and season nicely with salt and pepper and a small handful of flour. Toss around until all the fillets are well coated. Just before you start cooking the fish, put your broccoli into a colander, place on top of the potato pan, cover with the lid and steam for 4 minutes or so until cooked. While the broccoli is steaming, heat a lug of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan and quickly but carefully put your fillets in so they all cook at the same time. Cook for a couple of minutes until beautifully golden, then, starting with the fillet that went in first, turn them all over. Once you've done that, add the butter to colour and flavour the fillets. Cook for no more than another 2 minutes. When the fillets are golden on both sides, remove the pan from the heat. Wait for 20 seconds before squeezing in the juice of Â½ the lemon and shaking the pan about, otherwise the lemon juice will burn black and ruin the whole thing.

Use your clean fingers to toss it all together. Cook the fish for about 6 or 7 minutes in total. To tell if it's cooked, put your fork into the plumpest part of the flesh and if you can easily pull it away from the bone, it's ready.

I used Dover sole, but any sustainable or MSC-approved flatfish like plaice, dab or lemon sole would also be fantastic. Dover sole can be a bit on the pricey side, but they are so tasty that they are a wonderful treat every now and then. You want them skinned, with the heads left on, so ask your fishmonger to do this for you. I've used fresh cockles and peeled brown shrimps, which are deliciously sweet, but way underrated. This dish is best made for two so you can cook everything together quickly in one large pan. There's something about the way these ingredients work together that makes it such a luxurious dinner. Hope you love it.. Sort through the cockles or clams and tap them. If any stay open, throw them away. Give them a wash and slush about in a bowl of cold water. Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and slice the bacon into matchsticks, then add to the pan along with a drizzle of olive oil and fry until lightly golden. Strip the leaves from the sprigs of rosemary and add to the pan. Fry for a few more minutes, then remove everything to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add a small knob of butter to the bacon fat, give it a little shake and carefully lay both fish in the hot pan, head to tail. You're going to cook them at a medium high heat, so it won't take long, but the cooking shouldn't run away from you. Cook the fish for about 4 minutes, then carefully and confidently turn each one over with a large fish slice. Quickly return the rosemary and bacon to the pan and add the shrimps and the cockles or clams. Using a tea towel to protect your hands, cover the pan immediately with a lid or tinfoil, making it as airtight as you can. Cook for another 4 minutes, or until the cockles have all opened. Finely slice the chives, then remove the foil when the time is up. Squeeze in the juice of a lemon, scatter over the chives, add a good pinch of salt and pepper, then chivvy the pan around with a sense of urgency and remove the fish to a warm platter or two plates, pouring over all the juices and seafood from the pan.

Put the fillets in a dish in the fridge and let them sit there for an hour. Now make your black olive sauce by mixing all the ingredients except the vinegar together. You want the sauce to have the consistency of a coarse salsa. Then carefully balance the flavours with the vinegar to taste. If you're roasting your monkfish, preheat your oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7 just before the fish comes out of the fridge. Pat the fish dry with some kitchen paper and then pat it with a little olive oil. Peel and halve your potatoes. Put them into a pot of salted, boiling water and cook until tender. Then drain and mash up with 6 tablespoons of olive oil and a good swig of milk. Season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice. If you want to get your mash really smooth and creamy you can use a spatula to push the potato through a sieve once or twice. It doesn't make it taste any better but it will make it silky smooth, shiny and lovely. Just depends if you can be bothered, really. If it needs thinning with a little extra milk, feel free. To roast the monkfish, heat a large ovenproof frying pan, add a splash of olive oil and fry the fillets in the pan for 2 minutes. Then turn them over and put the pan in your preheated oven for 6 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. To grill, place the the butterflied fillets on a hot griddle pan and cook for about 3 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness.

I didn't grow up eating these, but they're beautiful and so easy. A bit like bubble without the squeak. This was my first attempt at mastering them and it turned into this lovely breakfast, which I made in a pretty little flat in Glasgow's West End. It's the posh area of town and is full of beautiful shops and neighbourhoods. Well worth a visit.
This dish is the best brunch I can think of, besides maybe kedgeree. I never would have thought of putting this much flour with potatoes, but it works brilliantly. Give them a go with bangers, stews, on their own, or as part of this lovely brunchâ€¦I assure you this is one of the nicest ways to start the day, ever. Cut the potatoes into 2.5cm chunks and cook them in boiling salted water for around 7 minutes, or until tender. Drain them, allow them to cool, then return them to the empty pan and add the flour. Lightly mash everything together but try to avoid stirring it up too much. Finely slice the chives and add them to the potatoes with a knob of butter and the baking powder, then mash a few more times. (If you like, you can grate a little cheese into the mixture at this point - it's delicious.) Season, then use your clean hands to bring the mixture together. Pinch off a little, taste and adjust the seasoning, then divide into 4 balls and dust with flour. Put a large frying pan (roughly 32cm) on a medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the potato balls (you may need to cook them in batches) and pat them down so they're almost flat - 2cm thick is about right. Cook for around 10 minutes, turning them every few minutes until golden on both sides. Meanwhile, beat the eggs so they are broken and marbled. Season and put aside. When your potato scones are perfectly cooked, divide them between your plates, then take the pan off the heat and add a knob of butter. Once bubbling, pour in the eggs and put back on a low heat. Don't be tempted to stir aggressively, use a rubber spatula to just sweep up the cooked layer of egg from the bottom of the pan every time it forms, so the uncooked egg can get down there and set. This will give you the nicest texture. The key to good scrambled egg is getting the perfect ratio of cooked silky egg and slightly less-cooked curds. To achieve that, you need to remove it from the heat once it looks three-quarters cooked - trust me. It will carry on cooking and by the time you mix it around one more time and serve, it will be gold. Arrange a piece of smoked salmon on top and add a pinch of watercress. Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil and serve with wedges of lemon for squeezing over."

Peel and slice the potatoes into chips. To make the mushy peas, pick and finely chop the mint leaves. Place the butter in a pan over a medium-low heat, add the peas and mint, pop the lid on and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and season to taste with sea salt and black pepper - you can either mush the peas up in a food processor, or mash them by hand until stodgy, thick and perfect for dipping your fish into. Keep them warm until needed. Pour the sunflower oil into a deep fat fryer or a large sturdy pan and heat it to 190°C/375°F. Mix Â½ a teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper together, then use it to season the fish fillets on both sides - this will help to remove any excess water, making the fish really meaty. Whisk the flour, beer and baking powder together until nice and shiny - the texture should be like semi-whipped double cream (i.e. it should stick to whatever you're coating). Dust each fish fillet in a little of the extra flour, then dip into the batter and allow any excess to drip off. Holding one end, gently lower the fish into the oil one by one, working carefully so you don't get splashed - it will depend on the size of your fryer or pan how many fish you can cook at once. Cook for 4 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the batter is golden and crisp, then remove to kitchen paper to drain. Meanwhile, parboil the chips in boiling salted water for 4 to 5 minutes, or until softened but still retaining their shape, then drain and steam dry. When the chips are nice and dry, fry in the oil that the fish were cooked in at 180°C/350°F until golden and crisp. While the chips are frying, transfer the fish from the kitchen paper to a baking tray. Place in the oven for a few minutes to finish cooking - this way they will stay crisp while you finish off the chips. When the chips are done, drain them on kitchen paper, season with salt, and serve with the fish and mushy peas. Other things to have on the table are some crunchy sweet pickled gherkins, some pickled onions (if your other half isn't around!) - and pickled chillies are good, too. Then you want to douse it all with some cheap malt vinegar and nothing other than Heinz tomato ketchup."

Rub the salmon fillet all over with 1 teaspoon of oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then place in a colander and cover with tin foil. When the time's up on the potatoes, place colander directly over the pan of boiling potatoes. Turn the heat down to medium-low and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the salmon and potatoes are both cooked through. Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley leaves, discarding the stalks. Once cooked, remove the fish from the colander to a plate, and discard the skin. Drain the potatoes, and leave to steam dry for 1 minute, then tip back into the pan. Mash the potatoes, spreading the mash round the sides of the pan to help it cool down quickly. When the potatoes are cooled, transfer to a bowl. Flake the salmon into the bowl, add 1 tablespoon of flour, the chopped parsley and a really good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Finely grate over the lemon zest, then mash and mix together really well. Dust a plate with a little flour. Divide the mixture into 4, then lightly shape and pat into circles about 2cm thick, dusting them with flour as you go. Put them onto a clean plate also dusted with a little flour. If you're going to freeze them, wrap them in clingfilm at this point and put them into the freezer. Otherwise simply pop them into the fridge for an hour before cooking - this will allow them to firm up slightly.

Mix together a good lug of extra virgin olive oil, a nice squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper. Drizzle this all over the fish then pat on the chopped marjoram or oregano. Put your fillets on the hottest part of the grill (make sure your grill is really clean to prevent the fish from sticking). If your fillets are 2cm thick, they'll only need about 2 minutes cooking time. If the fish breaks up, don't worry as you'll be flaking it up later anyway. If it still has the skin on, cook it skin-side down as it's less likely to stick. Once cooked, remove to a warm plate. To make the salad, finely slice the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Arrange on your plates. Finely slice your fennel bulb and dress it in a bowl with extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper then scatter over your tomatoes.

The most important bit is to put the other bit of bread on top and, using a little force, push down on your buttie which, for some reason, seems to make it taste even better. And that's it - all done. I tend to eat one of these while I'm walking about at home and I always get told off by the missus for dropping bits everywhere.

It's not cheap, but bear in mind you won't need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you haven't got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid. To make the saffron aÃ¯oli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shakerâ„¢ until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper. Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that aren't tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they don't close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little. Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that don't open.), Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly.

We've come to depend so heavily on tuna that it's now under a huge amount of pressure - this really is the time to turn to mackerel as an alternative. It's widely available in our waters and way down the food chain so we need to be buying and selling more of it, and learning how to cook and enjoy it. I like to treat mackerel more like a steak, and give it flavour and attitude to make it sing. It is so delicious, incredibly versatile and extremely good for you. Put a griddle pan on a high heat to get really hot. Add the rice to a pan with 2 mugs of boiling water and a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil on a high heat then turn the heat down to low, cover and leave for 7 to 8 minutes. Once the griddle is screaming hot, add the mackerel skin-side down (you may need to do this in batches). Use a fish slice to press the fish onto the pan. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper and finely grate over the zest of a lemon. Reduce to a medium-high heat and cook for about 8 minutes in total. Meanwhile, make your sauce. Use a fine grater to carefully grate the garlic, ginger, spring onion and chilli into a small bowl. Grate in the lime zest and mix, you should have a lovely slurry. Tear in the coriander leaves, add the sesame oil, soy sauce, honey and squeeze in the juice of the limes. Finish with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil then have a taste - you want to have a balance between sweet, sour, heat and fragrance. Check the mackerel, they should be lovely and dark on the skin side so carefully flip them over to finish cooking for a final few seconds. Check your rice; all of the water should have been absorbed. Divide the rice between your plates, top each portion with a piece of mackerel then drizzle over some of that gorgeous sauce. Scatter over the spring onion, mint, coriander and chilli, if using."

In the markets and supermarkets these days you can get some fantastic spring vegetables: baby carrots with tops, baby fennel with its herby leaves, baby turnips, peas and broad beans, fine green and yellow French beans, all really colourful and easy to cook with. Here's a nice little combination - it's all cooked in the same pot and gives you a lovely broth. The only thing you have to do is control the cooking times by adding the veg that need longer in the pot first. First, make the aioli. When you've done that, bring your stock to the boil in a large pan then add your fennel and allow this to boil for 4 minutes while you heat up a non-stick frying pan. Take your salmon steaks and, if you fancy it, you could finely slice a little of your mint and basil and push this into the score marks. Pat the salmon steaks with a little olive oil, season and place skin-side down in the frying pan. Leave them for 2 minutes to get really crispy then check how they're doing. They'll want around 4 minutes on the skin side and 1 minute on the other. You'll get an idea of how they're cooking as you'll see the salmon change colour. When the fennel has had 4 minutes, add the green beans and the broad beans. Give them a further 2 minutes. By this time you will probably want to turn over the salmon steaks for their last minute. Add the peas to the other veg and cook for a final 2 minutes. Don't be tempted to overcook the salmon - remove it from the heat. Divide the vegetables between 4 bowls, rip over the mint and basil, ladle over some of your hot cooking stock and place the salmon on top. Serve with a dollop of aÃ¯oli. Fantastic!"

If your barbie is small, feel free to cut the salmon in half to make it more manageable. Place the salmon skin side down on a plastic board and, using a sharp knife, slash it evenly all over on the fleshy side, making the incisions about 1cm deep. Grate the lemon zest and most of the chopped fennel tops or basil over the salmon, then push these flavourings into the incisions - don't hold back; really push them in!, Rub the fish lightly all over with olive oil then season with salt and pepper, giving the skin side a generous amount as most of this will fall off. When your barbie's ready, lay the salmon on the bars, skin side down. The flesh will start to colour from the bottom up and after about 4 minutes the skin should be beautifully golden brown. Carefully flip the salmon over with a roasting fork or a spatula and cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes on the other side. While it's cooking, gently ease the skin away from the fish and put it on the barbie alongside to crisp up.
If your salmon is wild it will have slightly less fat in it, so will be a drier fish. You can therefore cook it for a shorter amount of time, even leaving it slightly undercooked - although this might feel unusual to us Brits, who nuke fish beyond belief, this is a really good idea!, If it's (organically) farmed, cook it through, but please don't overcook it or it will become too dry. Lift the salmon carefully off the barbecue and place it on a nice serving platter or board. Allow to cool a little, then break the skin into pieces, a bit like poppadoms. Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, remove and discard the seeds, chop it up and mix it in a bowl with the yoghurt. Balance the flavours with the lemon juice, half the chopped chilli, and half the chopped mint or oregano. Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil. Season carefully to taste with salt and pepper. Break the salmon up with a fork into four to six chunks. Serve with the cucumber yoghurt, sprinkled with the rest of the chopped chilli and the remaining fennel tops or basil.

Traditionally, they prepare it in lots of different ways; pickled, salted, dried or smoked. This stew is similar to the way in which they slowly stew salt cod after soaking it (so that the excess salt seasons the other ingredients in the soup, like the potatoes). Good salt cod is quite hard to find these days, so I've adapted the recipe to use fresh cod, but you can also use hake, bass or halibut. In an appropriately sized large pan, slowly fry your onion and leek with around 5 tablespoons of olive oil for 5 minutes until soft and tender. With a teaspoon, remove and discard the fluffy tasteless core from the courgettes and grate the rest into the pan. Chop the potatoes into rough 2cm dice and add to the pan. Give everything a good stir and then add the anchovies. Turn the heat up and add the white wine. Allow to cook down by half before adding your milk and stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for half an hour until the potatoes are tender. At this point, add your cod and simmer for a further 15 minutes until the flesh flakes away; feel free to stir and break up the fish, but it's quite nice to leave some big chunks as well. Season carefully to taste. Divide between your bowls, and serve with a small handful of parsley and spring onion dressed with a little olive oil and lemon juice. Try this: Sprinkle a little orange zest over the parsley and spring onion. It really works with the cod."

Tear off a good handful of coriander and mint from the bunches and put to one side to use for garnish later. Finely chop the remaining herbs and really pat these around the tuna to encrust it. Wrap in cling film and place in the fridge until needed. Boil the noodles for 1 minute until they are slightly flexible, drain and allow to steam dry and cool. Add a little olive oil to a hot non-stick pan, add your noodles and leave them until they are nice and crisp on one side. Now flip them over and do the same on the other side - it doesn't matter if some stick to the pan, just scrape them up and turn them over. Divide the crispy noodles between 4 plates. Slice your tuna up about 0.5cm thick - in Japan it's a sign of generosity to have nice thick slices of tuna, but I like them a little thinner as they are more delicate in the mouth. Place the tuna on the noodles, sprinkle over the torn-up herbs that you put to one side earlier, sprinkle with the spring onions and then drizzle a couple of spoonfuls of the dressing over the tuna. Before your eyes you will see the cut sides of the slices of fish begin to change colour and ""cook"". Serve straight away."

Add the lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of olive oil and stir until you have a good drizzling consistency. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add your peas and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, then remove them with a slotted spoon or sieve. Add the broad beans to the pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, depending on their size. Drain and leave to cool, then pinch the skins off any big beans (you can leave the skin on any small or medium ones). To dress the peas and beans you want the same balance of acid and oil as you would have in a salad dressing. So, put the olive oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper into a large bowl. Chop up most of the mint and throw it in, add the peas and beans and mix everything around. Add lemon juice to taste. You can serve the dressed peas and beans hot or at room temperature. Heat a griddle pan or barbecue until hot, season your tuna steaks with salt and pepper and pat with some of the oregano oil. Place in the pan and sear for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Personally, I like to keep my tuna a little pink in the middle as this tastes much nicer, but if you're going to cook it through please don't nuke it. Tear the tuna into 2 or 3 pieces and toss in a large bowl with the rest of the oregano oil. This will give you a lovely combination of flavours. Serve the fish immediately with the peas and broad beans scattered with the rest of the mint leaves. P.S. Sometimes I love to throw random delicate greens like baby spinach, watercress, even rocket, in with the broad beans for 30 seconds before you drain them. The combination of peppery irony greens, creamy broad beans and sweet little peas makes the veg taste even better."

It's a terrific hot snack or main dish - and with the tuna all torn up it makes a great salad. I like to griddle the tuna for a minute on each side so it has colour on the outside but still remains a little pink in the middle. A lot of people still want to cook tuna all the way through (which I think is madness!), but you must do it how you like best. It's worth seeing if you prefer it pink in the middle though. I'm really going heavy on the herbs in this recipe - 4 or 5 years ago this might have been a bit OTT, but it's really easy to get hold of a good selection of herbs now, so the more the merrier. Feel free to use a couple of tins of beans if it's more convenient. Tinned beans aren't bad these days - they have got much better for some reason. But if you're using dried, which still taste better, soak them overnight in water. They'll double in size. You then just need to drain them and put them into a pan with fresh water to cover. Bring to the boil, then simmer them for around 40 minutes or until tender - sometimes I put a squashed tomato and a potato in the water with them, as it helps to soften the skins. When done, drain them, discarding the tomato and potato, and put them into a large bowl with 8 tablespoons of peppery olive oil, the red onion, anchovies and chillies. Season with salt and pepper and the lemon juice - for a bit of a twang. Preheat your griddle pan until really hot. Season the tuna steaks with salt and pepper, sprinkle over the lemon zest and pat a little olive oil on both sides. Sear the steaks for a minute on each side. While the fish is searing, get your guests round the table. Throw the herbs into the dressed beans, mix up and divide between the plates. Take the tuna off the heat, tear it up and place on top of the warm beans. Nice with some cold white wine."

In the UK, red mullet are hard to get hold of at the moment. Make sure your fish is from a sustainable source, and if you can't find sustainable red mullet, go for small red snapper instead. First get your barbecue going, with the coals piled up high on one side so it's super hot and low on the other side for a more gentle heat to give you some control. With a sharp knife, score each of your fish all over on both sides, about 1cm deep. This helps the flavours to get into the fish and will allow the heat right in so the fish gets cooked evenly right down to the bone. Get a big chopping board ready. Roughly chop the oregano leaves, then scatter them over the board. Sprinkle over a generous amount of salt and pepper. Roll the fish over board, pushing them down and rubbing the flavourings into the slashes. Place fish on to the hot side of the barbie to give them a bit of colour. You'll be making your salsa on the cooler side (or on your hob). Just heat a little olive oil in a frying pan, add the chopped olives and warm them through for a minute or so. Add the garlic, chilli and rosemary sprigs, give it a good toss and gently fry while you finish cooking your fish. After about 4 minutes, turn the fish over by easing them off the grill with a fish slice - be patient otherwise they will stick - and cook for another 4 minutes until cooked and moist on the inside, with a crispy skin on the outside. Remove and discard the sprigs of rosemary from the frying pan; they will have released lots of flavour so they've done their job. Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan and toss. Squeeze in the lemon juice and add the parsley leaves. Give the salsa a taste. Olives are usually quite salty so you probably don't need any more salt but that's your call. I might add a little pepper though. Once everything is warmed through, take the pan off the heat. Remove the fish to a plate. To make sure they are cooked, pull a bit of the meat away from the bone. If it comes away easily, you're in business. Serve the fish simply with some salsa spooned over the top. P.S. If you've got any leftovers, what I like to do is pull the fish away from the bone and flake it into a bowl. Toss with the leftover salsa, add some extra torn parsley leaves or peppery rocket, and serve with some nice bread."

Add the tomatoes and season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, then simmer gently over a low heat for 30 minutes, or until thickened and slightly reduced. When the time's up, remove the chilli, and break up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed, then add a tiny swig of red wine vinegar to give it a little twang. Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Pour the tomato sauce into a 20cm x 30cm roasting tray. Season the fish fillets on both sides with a little salt and pepper, then place on top of the sauce. Squash the olives, using the base of a jar or something heavy, and remove the stones. Sprinkle into the tray, along with the capers and most of the basil leaves over the fish. Cook in the oven for around 15 minutes or until the fish is cooked through - check by cutting into the thickest part of one or two of the fillets; they should be pearly white and not transparent.

Each mouthful is an outrageously delicious bit of heaven that anyone sensible won't be able to resist. The contrast of hot crispy soft Yorkshire pudding and cold creamy smoky trout with a good hit of horseradish is unbelievable. You can put the creamy smoked fish in one big serving bowl if you like, but I think it's quite sweet to make up a few individual servings in little teacups. Around May and June you'll start to see flowering chives around, and those are beautiful for decorating the top of the potted fish if you're out to impress. This is dead quick, so easy and absolutely perfect for a starter - just whack it right in the middle of the table so everyone can help themselves. Your guests will be fighting over it, I promise. Put the cream cheese into a mixing bowl with the horseradish, the zest of 1 lemon and the juice from half, and mix together. Mix in most of the chopped chives, then have a taste and add a pinch of salt and pepper. It's very important that this mixture has a bolshie attitude - it should be hot, smoky, salty, so add more horseradish or lemon juice if needed. Flake in the trout, removing any skin and bones, then use a spatula to fold the mixture together gently so you have smaller bits and nice chunks. Decant into a single nice serving dish or several little bowls or cups, then drizzle over a little rapeseed oil and sprinkle over a few more chopped chives. Cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge to get nice and cold. When you're nearly ready to eat, preheat the oven to full whack (about 240°C/475°F/gas 9) while you make your Yorkshire pudding batter. Get yourself a mini muffin tin (you can buy these easily online or in cooks' shops) and pour a little thimble of vegetable oil into the 16 compartments of the tin, so you have a thin layer covering the bottom of each. Pop the tray on to the top shelf in the hot oven for around 10 to 15 minutes, so the oil gets so hot that it smokes. While you're doing that, aggressively beat the eggs, flour, milk and a pinch of salt and pepper together, either by hand or in a food processor, until light and smooth. Transfer the mixture into a jug. Carefully take the tray out of the oven and quickly and confidently pour the batter into the hot tin so it nearly fills each well. Return the tray to the top shelf of the oven to cook for around 10 to 12 minutes, or until the Yorkies are puffed up and golden. Whatever you do, don't open the oven door! Get your cold cups and bowls of potted fish out of the fridge and serve on a board with those sizzling hot little Yorkies and some lemon wedges. To. Die. For."

Have a taste, and tweak with extra lime, oil or soy until you've got a good balance. Pour the dressing over your tuna and gently mix together - as soon as the acid from the limes hits the tuna it will begin to cook it so you only need to mix lightly. Click off the stronger outer leaves of your little gem lettuces - you want about 16 in total. Wash them and spin dry well, then line them up on a board.

Once the chicken is cooked, remove to a plate, cover with tin foil and a clean tea towel, then leave to rest. Place the rest of the birds directly on the oven shelf next to the duck. Sit the sausage wheel on top of the veg in the tray, then cook it all for 30 minutes, or until the birds are tender and cooked through. Meanwhile, to make the gremolata, peel the garlic, finely chop with the parsley leaves, then place in a bowl with the reserved fennel tops. Finely grate over the lemon zest, add a squeeze of juice and mix well. Remove the cooked birds from the oven and leave to rest. Move the roasting tray to the top shelf for a further 15 minutes, or until the sausage is cooked through and golden. Meanwhile, bring 1.1 litres of water to the boil in a large pan, then gradually add the polenta, whisking continuously until combined. Continue to stir over the heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until oozy, thick and smooth. Transfer the cooked veggies and sausage wheel to a plate, then skim away and discard the fat from the tray. Place on a medium heat on the hob, stir in the flour for 1 minute, then pour in the Chianti. Scrape up all that goodness from the bottom of the tray, then add the plum tomatoes, any resting juices from the chicken and the stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened and reduced to a lovely gravy consistency. Stir the butter into the polenta and finely grate in the Parmesan, loosening with a little water, if needed. Season to taste. Carve up the birds and slice the sausage, squeeze the onions and garlic out of their skins, then serve it all up on a board with the polenta. Scatter over the gremolata and serve the gravy and some steamed greens on the side."

Sear the meat in a hot pan on all sides - roughly 6 minutes for medium rare, 7-8 minutes for medium, and you'd have to be a nutter if you wanted to cook it for any longer than that! Depending on the thickness of the meat and the heat of the pan, it may need a little less or more time to cook - so don't look at the clock, look at the meat. This is the time when you want to try to be instinctive with your meat. Remove it from the pan when it's cooked to your liking and allow it to rest on a plate for 4 minutes, covered with tinfoil. Reduce the heat under the pan and add a good lug of oil. Add the shallots and the garlic and fry gently for around 3 minutes until translucent and tender.

If you cook it in the oven, turn the pieces of rabbit several times to ensure even colour and cooking. If you cook it on the barbecue, you'll need 5 wooden or metal skewers (soak wooden ones before you use them). Whether barbecuing or roasting, here are your rough timings:, Belly: 25 to 30 minutes.
Kidneys and liver: 4 minutes.
Saddle and ribs: 15 to 20 minutes.
Legs and shoulder: 35 to 40 minutes. Put your rabbit pieces into a bowl. Using a pestle and mortar, or a liquidizer, bash or whiz up the thyme and rosemary leaves to a pulp, then add the garlic cloves and bash or whiz again. Stir in 8 tablespoons of olive oil, the lemon zest and juice and the honey, and pour this over the rabbit. Put the meat to one side and let it come to room temperature while you light your barbecue. Now I'm going to talk about flavour. Get a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme and tie them together like a little brush. Each time you turn the meat, dab it with a little of the marinade to give you a lovely encrusted layer of flavour. This rabbit is going to be really tasty!, Keeping the marinade to one side, remove the pieces of meat and season with salt and pepper. Sandwich the pancetta between the 2 pieces of belly using 3 skewers. Put the legs and shoulder on the barbecue. When they've been cooking for 10 minutes, put the belly on. After another 10 minutes put the saddle and ribs on. Make sure you turn the meat over every so often. Look after it by controlling the temperature and basting it continuously with the marinade. Cut three-quarters of the way through each kidney and open them out like a book. Cut the liver into 4 pieces and push one piece on to each remaining skewer, followed by a kidney and more liver. When all the pieces of meat are beautifully cooked, add your skewered bits of kidney and liver on to the barbecue and cook until golden, along with your 2 remaining slices of pancetta. After a few minutes, when the pancetta is browned, put it on top of the meat at the cooler end of the barbie. Now get your guests round the table. You can serve the rabbit with any white beans, or roast potatoes, or grilled vegetables, or different salads - it really depends on how you feel and what the weather's like. Just put a big bowl of your chosen accompaniment in the middle of the table and serve all the meat on a board. Lovely with a glass of white wine. Simple, honest and bloody good."

In the past, I've seared pigeon breast, put it inside some lovely bread and had people tell me it's the best steak sandwich they've ever had! So here's how it's done ... This makes a brilliant casual lunch, dinner or snack with a nice salad. Turn the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Put the onions into a large pan on a medium low heat and add a lug of olive oil, a pinch of sea salt and white pepper, the sugar and the thyme leaves. Put the lid on and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. After this time, remove the lid, turn the heat up to high and give the onions a good stir, then add the vinegar and stir again. Leave the lid off and continue to cook down until the onions are really sticky and slightly golden. Keep your eye on them. Put the ciabatta into the hot oven. Heat a large non-stick pan on a high heat. Finely chop the rosemary leaves and put them into a mixing bowl. Add the pigeon breasts, drizzle over some olive oil, season with salt and pepper and grate over a few scrapings of nutmeg. Toss the pigeon until coated. Once the pan is really hot, add a lug of olive oil and the bay leaves and put in the breasts, skin side down so they crisp up nicely. Cook for around 2Â½ minutes on the skin side and 1 minute on the other side for tender and blushing medium- rare meat, which trust me is what you want - anything over that and it will be tough and boring. As you remove the pan from the heat, shake in a few good drizzles of Worcestershire sauce, then toss the meat in the juices. Move to a board and slice thinly at an angle. Get the warm bread out of the oven, open it out with a serrated knife, put it on a nice board and spread as much mustard as you dare on one side (be confident - you can spread a little butter on if you want, but I don't because the meat juices are enough). Put big pinches of watercress and those sticky onions down one side. Arrange the slices of pigeon around the sandwich, then dollop small amounts of cottage cheese in and around the meat. Push the top of the sandwich down and hold it for a couple of seconds so it sucks up all those juices. You can stab a knife through the sandwich to hold it together when you take it to the table. Serve next to a pint of good British ale."

Fold those crispy bits back into the mash, then pat and flatten down and repeat the process for about 15 or 20 minutes. Concentrate on building up flavours, character and crispiness. Halfway through the cooking, flip it over using a fish slice, or like a pancake if you're brave. If it breaks don't worry, just push it back together. Let it crisp up on the underside then nick a bit and taste it. This is the time to correct the seasoning. Once you're happy, serve it with a blob of HP sauce and whatever else you fancy."

Drain in a colander, leave to steam dry for 2 minutes, then lightly shake the colander to chuff up the chip edges. Divide between two baking trays, then season from a height with salt, pepper and the dried oregano. Drizzle each tray with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and toss to coat. Roast in a single layer for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway. To make the flatbreads, mix the flour, yoghurt and a pinch of salt together into a dough. Knead on a clean flour-dusted surface for 1 minute to bring it all together, then roll into 8 balls. Cover with a damp cloth. Thread the lamb on to a long, sturdy metal skewer to make one epic kebab (or split between two, if you prefer). Preheat a large griddle or barbecue to high, then cook the lamb for 15 minutes, or until dark and gnarly all over, turning regularly. Transfer to a large baking tray and roast in the oven for 5 minutes, or until just cooked through but still slightly blushing. For the salad, peel and coarsely grate the red onion with the tomato, cucumber and cabbage. Drizzle over the vinegar and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, season to perfection, then toss together. Roll the flatbreads out on a clean flour-dusted surface into Â½cm-thick rounds. Reduce the heat under the griddle to medium and - in batches - cook the flatbreads for 1 minute each side, or until charred. To serve, shave the meat off the kebab, drizzling over any resting juices (see tip below). On a plate, drizzle the feta with a little extra virgin olive oil. Put the yoghurt into a bowl and sprinkle over the paprika. Cut the remaining lemons into wedges. Serve it all in the middle of the table and let your guests get stuck in!"

Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan, add the onion, garlic and spring onions and sauté for 5 minutes, or until softened. Remove from the pan. Season the lamb and brown in the pan over a medium heat - you may need to do this in batches. Stir in the cinnamon, then return the onion mixture to the pan. Add the white wine and 100ml of water, and stir to pick up the crispy bits on the base. Simmer for 30 minutes, with a lid on for the first 5Â minutes. Beat 1 egg in a bowl, then grate in the cheeses. Cook the spinach or chard in a large pan of boiling water, then drain and leave to cool. Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4. Lightly grease a 23cm springform tart tin with a little oil. Divide the dough in half. Lightly flour a work surface and roll the first piece of dough into a circle, about 35cm wide. Carefully place it into the tin, lightly pressing into the base and sides, leaving about 3cm of pastry hanging over the rim. Spread half the lamb mixture over the base, followed by half the cheese mixture. Chop the cooled greens, then scatter half on top. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Roll out the second piece of dough and place over the filling. Trim the edges, but leave about 4cm of overhang, then roll it up and crimp the edges. Make a hole in the centre of the pastry lid. Beat the remaining egg and brush over the pie, then bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or till golden. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Serve with a mixed green salad."

Put the stock cube into the pan along with enough boiling water to just cover the meat. Bring to the boil, season and reduce to a simmer. Cover with a lid and cook for 1Â½ hours, or until the meat is tender (you should be able to cut the meat with a spoon). Now remove the lid and boil away most of the cooking liquid, until you have a thick gravy, then stir in half of the parsley (saving the rest to serve) and season. Set aside. Meanwhile, start the rice. Place a large pan of salted water over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Wash the rice under cold running water until the water runs clear, then add it to the pan. Simmer for 6 to 7 minutes, until it's almost cooked but the grains still have some bite. Drain in a colander and cool under cold running water. Allow the rice to drain completely. In a bowl, mix together the yoghurt, egg and lemon juice and season well. Set aside a quarter of the yoghurt mixture, then stir the rest of it into half of the cooked rice. Preheat the oven to 190°C/gas 5. In a large, heavy-based iron pot or casserole dish, melt the butter over a medium heat, brushing some up the sides of the pan. Pack the yoghurty rice into the base of the pan in one layer, then spread the lamb on top in another even layer. Mix the remaining rice with the leftover yoghurt mix, then use it to top the lamb. Cover with the lid or a layer of well-sealed foil. Bake in the oven for 1 hour, then remove the lid and bake for a further 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until you can see a dark golden crust all around the edge of the rice. When your dish is cooked, lower the pot into a sink of cold water for 1 minute (being careful the water doesn't get in), then run a knife around the inside. This will help release the rice from the pot. Working quickly, place a large platter or board on top of the pot and invert it, so the tah chin comes out. Don't worry if it isn't completely rigid - the bottom layer of rice will be softer, but you should have a crunchy golden crust on top. Serve your tah chin topped with the rest of the chopped parsley, pomegranate seeds, and some extra yoghurt on the side, if you like."

Separately freeze half the cool meat and gravy for another day. For the topping, sides and bottom, peel and roughly chop the potatoes and cook in boiling salted water for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain and leave to steam dry, then add the butter, grate in half the cheese, season to perfection with salt and pepper, mash well and cool completely. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Use a little reserved lamb fat to grease the inside of a large pie dish (25cm x 30cm), then pick and tear over the rosemary leaves and sprinkle with half the breadcrumbs - they'll stick to the fat and add an incredible crunch. A handful at a time, press the cooled mash into the dish, covering the bottom and sides with a 1cm-thick layer. Spoon in the filling and a couple of spoonfuls of gravy, smooth out, then top with the remaining mash, pat it flat, scuff it up with a fork and pinch it at the edges. Grate over the rest of the cheese, scatter with the remaining breadcrumbs and drizzle lightly with oil. Importantly, bake on the bottom of the oven for 1 hour 10 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Warm your gravy through (reducing if desired), then serve the pie with loads of seasonal greens or peas and lots of condiments."

Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour, then roll out each piece of pastry to the thickness of a pound coin, dusting and turning as you go. Repeat until you have 8 rounds. Place an even amount of filling on one side of each pastry sheet and brush the edges of the pastry with a little beaten egg. Pull the other half of the pastry over, feel where the filling is and use your thumb to press down and seal around the edges. Brush the pasties all over with the beaten egg, place on an oiled baking tray and cook in the hot oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden. Meanwhile, prepare the salad. Scrub the carrots and quarter lengthways. Discard the outer leaves of the lettuce, then cut it into slices. Toss the carrot and lettuce in a bowl. Chop the mint and stir into the yoghurt in another bowl with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Squeeze over a little lemon juice. Serve the pasties hot, with the salad and dressing on the side."

If you've never made homemade gravy before, give it a go - you can't beat it!, Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Turn the leg of lamb upside down on a chopping board and very gently cut halfway down into the leg along the bone so the meat opens out, creating a pocket. Make your stuffing by peeling a couple of garlic cloves and popping them into a food processor. As it's whizzing away, add the parsley and rosemary leaves, then the anchovies. Scrape this mixture into a bowl, then add the ciabatta and pine nuts to the processor. You want it to be quite coarse so just pulse it a few times, then tip it into your bowl of herbs along with the chopped olives and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper, then get your clean hands in the bowl and scrunch everything together. If it looks too dry, add a little lemon juice. Pack this stuffing into the pocket of the lamb, then wrap the meat back over and tie it tightly with string, pushing the remaining rosemary sprigs underneath the string. Drizzle over a little olive oil, pat this into the lamb and season with salt and pepper. Place your roughly chopped onion, carrot and celery in a roasting tray with any remaining unpeeled garlic cloves and lay your lamb on top. Roast for about an hour and a half. In Italy, they'll start basting the lamb after 30 minutes by pouring a swig of wine over the meat and veg every 15 minutes or so until the meat is cooked. Trust me - it is well worth doing and makes it juicy and delicious! When cooked, transfer the lamb to a board or platter to rest while you make your gravy. Spoon off most of the fat from your tray, then put it on the hob over a low heat. Add the flour and mash everything together with a potato masher. Add a glass of red wine and bring to the boil, to cook off the alcohol. Pour in the stock and bring back to the boil, scraping all the goodness from the bottom of the pan as you go. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Sieve your gravy into a jug or pan, using a ladle to really push all the goodness through. Discard any veg or meat left behind. At this point, your lamb will have been resting for around 15 minutes and will be perfect for serving. Dish it up and tuck in!"

It will probably curdle a little, but don't worry, a blast from a hand blender will sort that out. Cook gently for about 20 minutes until the sauce begins to thicken. Season carefully with salt and turn the heat off. When you're ready to serve, preheat a ridged griddle pan on a back ring of your cooker (it's safer).

Ask your butcher for extra long lamb cutlets, untrimmed, so you have big Captain Caveman style chops to gnaw on. Marinate the lamb overnight if you can, to really intensify the flavours, which are inspired by the amazing Yemeni cooks I met in the old Tiger Bay community near the docks in Cardiff. Their community has been there for over 200 years, ever since the coal boom of the industrial revolution brought their ancestors to Wales. Their food hasn't become famous in the same way other cuisines have. But it should have. It's some of the most exciting food I've seen in a long time. Pound the marinade spices, chillies and garlic to a paste using a pestle and mortar, add a good pinch of salt and pepper, then muddle in just enough olive oil to make the mixture nice and loose. Get a roasting tray, put in the cutlets and rub the marinade all over them. Cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge, or to one side if you're cooking right away. Now get all your little dips ready. Put the nuts, sesame seeds, cumin and a pinch of salt into a dry frying pan and toast for a few minutes, tossing occasionally. Once golden, tip them into the mortar and pound up a few times until fine and crunchy, then pour them into a little bowl. Coarsely grate the cucumber on a box grater, then transfer it to a bowl, squeezing out any excess liquid. Finely chop the mint and add it to the bowl with the yoghurt, a good pinch of salt and pepper, and a good squeeze of lemon juice. Stir, then put into a little bowl next to the toasted nuts. Halve the tomatoes and rub each half, cut side down, on the finer side of the grater so you end up with a fresh tomato slurry. Discard the skins, then finely grate in half the chilli. Season with salt and pepper, stir in a squeeze of lemon juice, sprinkle over some coriander leaves, and crumble over a little feta. Have a taste, adjust if you want it a bit spicier, or saltier, then put it into a little bowl next to the other dips. Heat a griddle pan on a high heat and cook the lamb cutlets for around 4 minutes on each side, standing them on their fatty sides for a minute or two extra to crisp up. Once they are sizzling and golden, they're done. Pile them on a board, then get stuck in and encourage everyone to dunk the chops in the dips and some of the based up nuts. Lovely with flatbreads or rice."

A thousand pictures go through my head just thinking about my old man slicing lamb on a Sunday. This brilliant roast lamb dish uses Italian staples to make a delicious stuffing - it's nice to get all the herbs in the ingredients list, but if you can only get hold of a couple, don't worry. Try to buy the lamb from your own butcher or a supermarket with a qualified butcher's section. Tell them you want a nice leg of lamb, preferably organic, with the H-bone and thigh-bone tunnel-boned and removed. This sounds complicated but it's just butchers' jargon. It means the top half of the leg has the bone removed leaving just the ankle bone, allowing you to stuff it. For the veg, turnips, Jerusalem artichokes, celeriac, fennel and parsnips are all good. Peel a couple of garlic cloves and pop them into a food processor - as it's whizzing add your mixed herbs. Add the pancetta and anchovies and whiz again. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and add the bread to the processor. Whiz to coarse breadcrumbs, and add to the bowl with the pine nuts and olives. Add salt and pepper and scrunch everything together with your hands. If it looks too dry, add a drop of boiling water. Push the stuffing into the cavity in the lamb. You can roast it stuffed like this, or you can tie it up with string, pushing some rosemary underneath. Pat it with olive oil on the outside and season with salt and pepper. Toss the potatoes and remaining garlic with the bay leaves, the rest of the rosemary and some olive oil, salt and pepper and put them into a roasting tray with the lamb in the middle. It's unusual to see rare or pink roasted meats in Italy, so we're going to cook our lamb like they do. Roast it for about an hour and a half at 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Trust me - it will be juicy and delicious! After half an hour, the Italian way is to start basting the lamb with a swig of wine over the meat and veg every 15 minutes or so until the meat is cooked. Remove the veg to a dish when cooked to keep them warm. When the lamb is cooked, let it rest for 15 minutes. It's nice served with some simply cooked greens. The Italians prefer the goodness from the meat juices to be cooked into the vegetables in the tray rather than make gravy."

Add the garam masala and a good pinch of sea salt and give it a stir. Keep frying until the meat is lovely and crispy. Shave the carrots into long thin strips with a speed peeler or a mandolin slicer and keep them to one side. Heat a small frying pan over a moderate heat and toast the cumin seeds for 30 seconds - they will start to smell nutty and gorgeous. You're not trying to cook the seeds here, you're just waking their flavours up a bit. Put them into a pestle and mortar and grind them up. Place the pan back on the heat and toast the sesame seeds until golden. Transfer them to a plate. Slice your peeled shallots or onion wafer thin. As with all salads that contain onion, you don't want to be coming across great big chunks! If you don't feel confident about your knife skills, use the coarse side of a box grater instead. This will almost mush your onions to a purée, but at least you won't come across any big bits. To make your dressing, grate the lemon zest and squeeze the juice into a bowl and add the shallots or onion, grated ginger, ground cumin and a pinch of salt. Whisk everything together with about 5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Pour the dressing over the carrots, add the coriander and mint leaves, and mix it all together using your fingers. It's important that you have a little taste to check whether the dressing needs more lemon juice, oil or seasoning. Divide the crunchy lamb mince between four plates and put the dressed salad on top. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds. Served with naan bread, some yoghurt and lemon halves, this makes a great snack!"

Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and chop into large chunks. Peel the carrots and swede, then chop into small chunks. Prep the greens by separating out the leaves and finely slicing any tougher stalks. When the lamb is nearly cooked, put your potatoes, carrots and swede into a large pot of boiling salted water and boil hard for 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain and allow to steam dry, then smash them up in the pan with a knob of butter. If you prefer a smooth texture, add some cooking water.

Either way, get your cooking source preheated. Place the lamb in a food processor with most of the thyme, chilli, cumin and sumac (reserving a little of each for sprinkling over later), a little sea salt and black pepper and all the pistachios. Put the lid on and keep pulsing until the mixture looks like mince. Divide the meat into six equal pieces and get yourself six skewers. With damp hands, push and shape the meat around and along each skewer. Press little indents in the meat with your fingers as you go - this will give it a better texture when cooked. In one bowl, mix the salad leaves and mint. In another, combine the sliced onion with a good pinch of salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice (the acidity will take the edge off and lightly pickle the raw onion). Scrunch this all together with your hands, then mix in the parsley leaves. Grill the kebabs until nicely golden on all sides.

Otherwise use a preheated ridged griddle pan. Slap the cutlets with the heel of your hand to flatten them slightly. Then bash up your thyme in a pestle and mortar and add a little olive oil. Mix together, then rub the oil over the cutlets and season both sides of them. Put to one side. Cook the mushrooms dry on the bars of your hot griddle pan. This is quite an unusual way to do it, but it gives you a nutty flavour that you wouldn't get otherwise. Just grill them on both sides to mark them and put them into a large bowl. Once the mushrooms are done you can put the lamb on the barbecue or griddle pan. If the cutlets are about 1.5cm thick, just give them 3 or 4 minutes on each side until they're really golden. This should cook them medium. (To be honest, I'm not really into rare lamb cutlets, but if you prefer them like that then cook for a little less time.), When cooked, put the lamb cutlets into the bowl with the mushrooms and drizzle with a little olive oil. Tear over the parsley, in quite large pieces, and add a good squeeze of lemon juice. Season lightly and toss around. Place to one side to rest, to allow all the lovely juices to get sucked up by the mushrooms. Meanwhile you can make a really quick sauce. It looks a bit like pesto, but although it contains basil and pine nuts it has no similarity in flavour. In a pestle and mortar pound up the pine nuts until you have a mushy pulp - this will give the sauce a creamy flavour and texture. Remove the mixture to a bowl, then use the pestle and mortar to bash the basil up into a pulp. Add this to the pine nuts and loosen with extra virgin olive oil so that the sauce easily drops off the end of a spoon. Now you need to balance it with quite a lot of balsamic vinegar to give it a good zing, almost like a mint sauce, but add it to taste. Give the lamb and mushrooms a final toss. I like to serve this up on a big platter and let everyone help themselves. Have the sauce and a simple watercress salad on the side."

Pile the flour into a large bowl and make a well in the middle. Add the eggs to the well, use a fork to whip up the eggs until smooth (add a tablespoon of cold water, if needed), then gradually bring the flour in from the outside until it becomes too hard to mix. With floured hands, bring it together into a ball of dough. Knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for 4 minutes, or until smooth and elastic (add a touch more water or flour, if needed). Cover with a clean damp tea towel and leave to relax for 30 minutes. For the filling, you'll need to wear rubber gloves. Rinse the nettles in cold water, then strip the leaves into a large bowl, discarding the stalks. Trim the leeks, halve lengthways, wash and slice 2cm thick. Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1 knob of butter, strip in the marjoram and stir in the leeks.

Tip the mixture onto a board and chop super-finely. Finely grate over most of the Parmesan, and add the soft cheese, then chop again, mixing as you go. To make the ravioli, take a third of the pasta dough (save the rest in a container in the fridge for tasty cooking another day) and roll out a sheet that is just 1mm thick - use a pasta machine, or do it by hand with a rolling pin. Once you have a thin sheet (you should be able to see your hand through it), lay it out horizontally on a flour-dusted surface in front of you. Place teaspoonfuls of your filling along the lower half of the pasta sheet, 8cm apart. Brush the upper edge of the pasta with water and fold it towards you, covering the filling and pressing around it to remove any air. Use a pasta cutter or knife to cut out the ravioli. Pop them on a flour-dusted tray and repeat with the rest of the dough. Place a large pan of water on to boil with a good pinch of salt. Get a small saucepan on a low heat and add a knob of butter, letting it slowly melt. Reduce the water to a simmer, and cook 6 pieces of ravioli at a time (2 portions) for 1 minute, or until cooked but still with a little bite. Scoop the pasta straight into the buttery sauce, bringing some starchy cooking water with it, toss gently, then spoon on to warmed plates. Finish each portion with shavings of Parmesan.

Put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. One at a time, dry fry the quesadillas for 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp on the outside, and the cheese has melted in the middle, turning halfway. Meanwhile, jazz up your houmous. Add half a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon or lime juice to the houmous tub, and mix together. You can add some fresh herbs here if you have any. Let each quesadilla cool for at least a minute before slicing into wedges. Finely slice the chilli, if using.

So we had a scout around the supermarkets and developed a really delicious and impressive recipe for this. It's dramatic and stretches the meat a fairly long way. The case of pastry and minced mushrooms keeps the breast moist and delicious and is a little forgiving so the meat holds its juices. You could assemble it a day before and just leave it in the fridge ready to over deliver on Christmas day. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Place the turkey breast upside-down on a board. Gently slice into the natural join of the breast muscle to open it out and make a sort of pocket. Season well and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle over half the thyme leaves, then spread over an even layer of cranberry jam, pushing it into all the nooks and crannies. Fold it back into shape to seal the mixture inside - swiss roll-stylie - and push a few cocktail sticks into the seam to keep it together. Transfer the turkey to a roasting tray, season the outside with the remaining thyme leaves, a good pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Rub it all over, cover in tin foil and roast in the hot oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until just cooked through - using a thermometer, you want it to be 72°C at the thickest point. Meanwhile, soak the porcini in a dish of just-boiled water. After 5 minutes, stir with a fork so any bits of grit sink to the bottom. Add the bacon to a large frying pan with a splash of oil on a medium heat and fry for 5 to 10 minutes, or until beautifully golden and super crispy. Strip in the leaves from 2 rosemary sprigs for the last 30 seconds or so. Remove everything from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat behind. Add the fresh mushrooms to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper. Drain and chop the porcini, saving the water, then stir into the pan. Add a splash of the water, avoiding the grit, then cook for around 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pan starts to sizzle again and the mushrooms are golden, soft and sticky with caramelly edges. To make the gravy, cut the thigh off the turkey leg and slash into it slightly. Throw the leg and thigh into a pot along with the carrot, leek and onion. Stir in the flour, add a good pinch of salt and pepper and 2 litres of boiling water. Add a heaped tablespoon of cranberry jam, the balsamic vinegar and remaining rosemary sprig. Bring back to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for around 2 hours, or until thick. Strain it through a sieve and reheat before serving. When the mushroom pan is dry, add a knob of butter and toss to coat.  Tip the mushrooms into the food processor and whiz until you get a good mixture of smooth and chunky. Leave to cool. Once the turkey breast and stuffing have cooled, you can get on with assembling the wellington. Dust a clean surface with flour, then roll out each packet of puff pastry to the size of a shoe box (one will be the base, one the lid - roll the lid ever so slightly bigger). Line a large roasting tray with greaseproof paper, dust with flour, then add the smaller piece of pastry. Spread half of the mushroom stuffing onto the middle of the base to cover an area the same size as your turkey breast. Remove the cocktail sticks, then place the turkey breast on top and spread the remaining stuffing over the top packing it all in and smoothing it out so that the whole breast is covered.  Sprinkle with the crispy bacon and rosemary, then brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg. Lay the second sheet of pastry over the top, gently mold it round the shape of the breast, pushing all the air out and seal together. Trim the edges  to around 4cm, then pull, twist, tuck and pinch in the pastry (like in the picture). Brush the whole thing with beaten egg then all the hard work's done. Leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight until you're ready to cook. On Christmas day, cook at 180°/350°F/gas 4 for 50 to 60 minutes, or until risen, puffy and beautifully golden and the turkey is piping hot throughout. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for around 10 minutes before carving. Serve carved into 2.5cm with the gravy and all the usual. Christmas in a mouthful."

This is dead simple, completely versatile and absolutely gorgeous. It's not a pretty-boy pie; it's a proper, old-school pie that everyone will be over the moon to see on the table. I'm putting leftover white turkey meat to good use here, but you could also mix brown meat in there too. Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Put your bacon in a large pan on a medium heat and add your thyme leaves. Add a lug of olive oil and let it all fry off a few minutes. Add all of your prepped leeks and fry them off for about 3 minutes. Add a pinch of salt and pepper then pop the lid on top, turn the heat down to medium and let them cook away gently for 30 minutes, stirring every 5 to 10 minutes to make sure they don't catch. There's going to be enough moisture in the leeks to keep them happy in the pan so they should be soft and melt in your mouth once they're done. When your leeks are ready, add the turkey meat to them and stir. If you've got a bit of stuffing mixed in there you can put that in too. Add the flour, mix it in well then pour in your stock and stir again. Add the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che then turn the heat up and bring everything back up to the boil. Have a taste and add a bit more salt and pepper if it needs it then turn the heat off. Pour the mixture through a sieve over another large empty pan and let the wonderful gravy from the mixture drip into the pan while you roll out your pastry. Get a deep baking dish roughly 22 x 30cm. Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with a bit of flour and roll your pastry out so it's about double the size of your dish. Crumble the chestnuts over one half of the pastry then tear a few of the sage leaves over the chestnuts. Fold the other half of pastry on top then roll it out carefully and evenly so you have a rectangle big enough to cover your baking tray. Don't worry if a few bits stick out here and there. Spoon that thick leek mixture from your sieve into the pie dish and spread it out evenly. Lay your pastry on top, tuck the ends under then gently score the pastry diagonally with your knife. Add a pinch of salt to your beaten egg then paint this egg wash over the top of your pastry. Pop your pie in the oven for about 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is puffed up and golden brown.  When the pie is ready, re-heat the lovely gravy and serve with your pie, along with some peas tossed in butter, lemon, salt and pepper and everyone's happy!"

Lay the leeks on a board and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Using a rolling pin, press down on top of the leeks to really squeeze the seasoning into them. This will also loosen their texture. Weave the leeks in and around the tomatoes. Pour over the balsamic vinegar, drizzle over the olive oil, and bake in the preheated oven for an hour.

I remember looking at the pile of shells and thinking, I'm never going to eat those, but my mum said, â€˜Don't look at them, darling, just eat them,' so I did. Once I figured out how to use an empty shell as pincers to grab the meat from the other shells, I went through the whole bowl in no time flat. Mussels are one of the most sustainable types of seafood. They can be cultivated on a large or small scale, they clean the water around them, take literally 4 minutes to cook and are nutritious and wonderful to eat â€¦ I can't think of any negatives! What are you waiting for?, Quickly wash and debeard all the mussels (pull off any bits that look like wire wool), discarding any that won't close (your fishmonger will do this for you if you ask in advance). Trim, wash, then finely slice the leek and the stick of celery, reserving any of the delicate yellow leaves for sprinkling over later. Put a really wide, deep pot on a medium heat and add a lug of olive oil and a knob of butter, along with the sliced leek and celery. Cook and stir for 10 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened, then flake in the smoked haddock and pour in the whisky - feel free to light it with a match to burn off the alcohol if you want. I think this adds to the flavour, but don't set yourself on fire. Next, add the mussels and single cream. Stir and shake the pan, put the lid on and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or literally just until the mussels have all popped open - discard any that haven't. Use a slotted spoon to move them to a large serving platter or bowl. Leave the pan of cooking liquor on the heat and let it bubble away until it thickens to a consistency you're happy with. While that's happening, roughly chop the parsley, then add it to the pot and shake it about. Have a quick taste of the sauce, correct the seasoning if it needs it, and pour all over the mussels. Scatter over any celery leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve straight away with fresh or toasted hunks of bread for a beautiful hearty lunch or dinner."

I decided to do a bit of reinventing on the classic mince pie, so in this recipe I'm using a combination of puff and filo pastry, both of which you can buy ready-made in the shops for extra convenience. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Scoop the mincemeat into a mixing bowl and mix in the dried berries, the clementine zest and the sherry or brandy. Dust a clean work surface with flour and roll out the puff pastry into a big rectangle about 20cm x 40cm and the thickness of a pound coin. Thinly spread the mincemeat over the pastry, leaving a 1cm gap around the edges. Tightly roll up the pastry, lengthways, like a Swiss roll, place it on a floured tray, and pop in the fridge to firm up. Take two cupcake trays (for 12 cupcakes each) and butter each one lightly with the melted butter. Place one layer of filo pastry over the tray (you may need more than one sheet to cover each tray depending on the size of the sheets) and ease the pastry into each hole. Brush with the melted butter, then cover with a second layer of filo pastry. Brush with butter again. Take the puff pastry roll out of the fridge and, with a sharp knife, cut it into 24 slices. Place each slice, flat-side down, into a filo-lined hole. Brush with the egg and sprinkle a few flaked almonds on top of each little pie, then pop both trays in the oven for about 25 minutes, until cooked and golden brown. Leave to cool, then crack the individual pies out of the trays. Dust with a little icing sugar before serving. PS You can freeze the cooked, cooled mince pies in their trays (just wrap the lot in cling film) or in a plastic container. Just reheat them in a hot oven straight from the freezer."

(Alternatively, cut out smaller circles and line a 12-hole bun tray.), Spoon the mincemeat into the pastries and bake for 20 minutes, until cooked through and golden, and the mincemeat is bubbling hot. Set aside on a wire rack to cool completely. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites with 1 tablespoon of caster sugar until it thickens and you have stiff peaks. Gradually whisk in the rest of the sugar and keep whisking for a few more minutes until the meringue turns thick and glossy.

Start by making the pastry. Sift the flour and xanthan gum into a food processor, add the margarine, vegetable shortening and a pinch of sea salt, and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. If you don't have a food processor, place the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and cut together with the flat of a knife. Add 2 tablespoons of cold water, pulsing as you go (or stirring with a flat-bladed knife, if making the pastry by hand), until the mixture begins to pull together to form a dough. Tip the pastry into a large bowl (or keep in the same bowl, if making it by hand) and, using your fingertips, pull together into a ball. Knead lightly for about 2 minutes  or until smooth and elastic. Shape the pastry into a ball and place between 2 large sheets of clingfilm, then roll it out into a circle slightly larger than the tart tin and no thinner than 3mm. Peel off the uppermost sheet of clingfilm and carefully flip the pastry into a deep 23cm tart tin. Peel away the remaining clingfilm and gently press the pastry into the sides of the tin, filling in any cracks with pastry and patting it flat with your fingertips. Trim the edges and set aside. Next, prepare the potatoes. Peel and cut in half, quartering any large ones. Place in a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. The second the water begins to boil, time the potatoes, allowing them to cook for  4 minutes before removing from the heat and draining. Shake the potatoes in the colander a little to chuff up the edges - this helps them crisp up. Pour 8 tablespoons of the groundnut oil into a large roasting tin, tip in the potatoes and 1 heaped teaspoon of sea salt and firmly shake to coat evenly. Set aside while you make the filling for the tart. Finely chop the onion, crush the garlic, then finely grate the carrots. Trim the stalks from the chestnut mushrooms and slice into rounds. Halve 240g of the chestnuts (the rest will be used for the topping). Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy-based frying pan until hot, add the onions and cook gently over a low heat until softened. Add the carrots, garlic, thyme and mushrooms, and fry gently until softened and all of the liquid from the mushrooms has been absorbed - around 10 minutes. Stir in the cream cheese and halved chestnuts and mix together gently until the cheese has softened and formed a creamy mixture. Season to taste, spoon the filling into the pastry case then level the top. Place the tart on the baking tray on the top shelf of the oven and the potatoes on the bottom shelf. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is crisp. Remove the tart from the oven, cover loosely in foil to retain its heat and set aside. Move the potatoes to the top shelf of the oven and increase the temperature to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Continue roasting the potatoes for a further 25 to 30 minutes until golden and crisp. For the gravy, heat the walnut oil and redcurrant jelly in a small saucepan, stirring until melted and smooth. Add the hot stock, bring to a simmer and stir in the cornflour. Simmer gently and stir continuously until you have the desired consistency. Set aside. Finally, tear the wild mushrooms into pieces, roughly chop the remaining chestnuts and finely chop the parsley. Heat the garlic oil in a heavy-based frying pan until hot, add the mushrooms and fry gently until softened. Stir in the chestnuts, cranberries and parsley, and spoon over the tart to form a decorative layer. Reheat the gravy and serve with the tart and roast potatoes."

It will be sticky to begin with, so stop and scrape the sides as you go. Place a large sheet of greaseproof paper on a work surface and sit the dough on it. Then, with lots of gluten-free flour on your hands and rolling pin, roll out the dough as thinly as possible (less than 5mm). If you're making individual tartlets, oil and flour four 10cm loose-bottomed tart tins, then cut the pastry to size. For 1 large tart, roll out the dough and cut to the size of a large, shallow baking tin, and transfer to the tin using a fish slice. Prick the pastry all over with a fork, cover with greaseproof paper, fill with baking beans or rice and bake blind for 12 to 15 minutes. Leave to cool in the tray, and keep the oven on. Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms. Heat 1 tablespoon of rapeseed oil in a pan over a medium heat, then sauté the mushrooms for 6 to 8 minutes, until golden. Remove and set aside. In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of rapeseed oil and wilt the spinach (or heat through if frozen) along with the pepper. Blitz the spinach, avocado flesh, tofu, nutmeg and lemon juice in a food processor until smooth. Thinly slice the sweet potato using a vegetable peeler or mandolin, creating a pile of peelings. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a small pan, then fry the peelings over a high heat, turning occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes, until just turning crisp.

It's an exciting dish and the end result will definitely blow you away, but you'll have to take a bit of time with it and show it some love. You'll want to buy the pork from a good butcher and ask for a boneless loin of pork with the skin off (but keep it for crackling) and belly on. Keeping the belly on makes stuffing the pork much easier. A nice little tip is to ask your butcher to give you the bones, as these will make a brilliant trivet to roast your meat on. Preheat your oven to its highest setting. Tear or roughly chop your mushrooms - thick, thin and wonky, it doesn't matter, you want it chunky and rustic. Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat, add a lug of olive oil, the thyme leaves and mushrooms, and toss around a bit. Next, add the sliced garlic and knob of butter. Fry everything off for about 10 minutes until the mushrooms are browning a little around the edges. Add the lemon zest with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then remove to a bowl and let it cool. Once cool, add the bread and toss together. Now turn your attention to the pork. Lay the loin and belly on a board, fatty-side down, and use a knife to make a little pocket between the loin and the belly meat. Stuff the cooled mushroom mixture into the pocket, then season well all over with salt and pepper. If you've got any garlicky, thyme and lemon juices left in the pan, pour these over the pork for some wonderful added flavour. Rub all the seasoning and juices into the pork. Roll the belly around the loin and tie it tightly with 5 or 6 pieces of string to keep it all in place. If your butcher gave you the bones, scatter them around the bottom of an appropriately sized roasting tray - you want the pork to sit quite snugly in the tray - and put the meat on top. Place in the oven and immediately turn it down to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 so the meat cooks through nice and evenly. This is a good time to get the crackling ready for the oven, so score the skin with a small sharp knife to open it up for seasoning. Bash up the fennel seeds and salt in a pestle and mortar, rub a generous amount of this into the skin and place it on a baking tray. After the meat has had an hour in the oven, take it out and add the chopped vegetables and remaining bulb of garlic to the tray, roughly broken apart into unpeeled cloves. Pour in the glass of cider and give the tray a shake to coat everything. Put it all back in the oven to cook for another hour. The crackling can also go in at this point. Before the second hour is up, put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Peel and cut the celeriac and potatoes into even-sized chunks, then boil for 12 to 15 minutes until soft and ready to mash. Drain and let them steam-dry, then return to the pan with a good knob of butter, some seasoning and the milk. Mash until smooth, adding a splash more milk if you need it. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve. When the pork is ready, remove it from the oven on to a plate and cover with tin foil, so it can rest for about 20 minutes while you crack on with the gravy. You'll have some nice roasted root veg and sticky goodness left in the bottom of the tray. Pour or spoon off the excess fat in the tray, then place it over a very low heat and pour in the stock a little at a time (you may not need to use all of it), using a potato masher as you go to mash up all the vegetables. Keep stirring to make sure you get all the lovely sticky brown bits off the bottom of the tray. Add the flour and keep reducing the gravy down until you get the consistency you like. Pass the gravy through a sieve to get rid of any lumps, then serve with the warm mash, stuffed pork and beautiful crackling."

Serve it as a nice autumn supper with a lovely glass of Chianti, or as a starter for a dinner party. Don't worry if you can't get hold of wild mushrooms - this works just as well with chestnut or field varieties. You can find scamorza, a delicious smoked mozzarella, at Italian delis and most supermarkets, but a good-quality buffalo mozzarella works just as well. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Heat a griddle pan and toast the ciabatta slices until they have lovely dark griddle marks. Tear up the toasted bread into chunks or, if using carta di musica, break up into pieces and toss with a drizzle of olive oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Get yourself a medium-sized earthenware dish, drizzle it with a little olive oil then add the seasoned, toasted bread. In the same bowl you used for the bread, add the sliced garlic, chopped bacon and thyme leaves, then tear over the mushrooms, leaving any little ones whole. Crumble in the dried chilli, then use your hands to toss everything together and get all those wonderful flavours going. Sprinkle this mixture fairly evenly on top of the bread, then tear over big pieces of the scamorza. Give the whole lot one final drizzle of olive oil, and put it in the oven to bake for about 30 minutes, until the mushrooms are beginning to crisp up and the cheese is melted, bubbling and starting to brown. While that bakes, wash and dry the salad leaves, and make a simple dressing by squeezing the juice of half a lemon into a jam jar. Top with twice as much extra virgin olive oil, and add a good pinch of salt and pepper. Put the lid on and give it a good shake, then put it to one side. Once the mushrooms are ready, drizzle some of your jam-jar dressing over the salad (any leftover dressing will keep happily in the fridge for a few days).

In fact, they're so delicious I end up eating them as soon as they come out of the pan, so not all of them make it to the table! You can use one type of mushroom - like I've done here with the field mushrooms - or a mixture. Tearing them up into different sizes will add a wonderful mixture of textures, colours and flavours. Start by making your posh, flavoured vinegar. Put the whole sprigs of tarragon and thyme, the peppercorns and garlic slices into a bottle, then top with the vinegar, making sure it completely covers all the herbs and spices. Allow the vinegar to steep for at least a few hours and, remember, the longer you leave it, the more delicious it will become. You can let it infuse for a couple of weeks to really push up the flavour and, as long as you strain the vinegar after this time and bottle it up, you can keep using it for a good few months. Fill a deep pan with the olive oil and let it heat up over a medium heat. Meanwhile, put the flour on a large plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and the lemon zest. Cut or tear the mushrooms into uneven chunks, and sprinkle them with a bit of water to moisten them. Toss handfuls of the mushrooms in the seasoned flour until they are all lightly coated. To test if the oil is hot enough, add a small piece of potato to the pan. Once it begins to sizzle and brown, the oil is ready. Deep-fry the mushrooms in batches - about a handful at a time - until they're golden brown. The cooking time will depend on the size of the mushrooms but it shouldn't take more than 3 or 4 minutes - just use your instincts. Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and leave on kitchen paper to drain for a minute. Serve as soon as possible sprinkled with a pinch of salt, some posh vinegar and some roughly chopped parsley. Delicious!"

Get a large casserole-type pan nice and hot, then add a good couple of lugs of olive oil and your fresh mushrooms. Stir around very quickly for a minute, then add your garlic, onion and thyme and a small amount of seasoning. After about a minute you'll probably notice moisture cooking out of the mushrooms and at this point add half of your porcini, chopped up, and the rest left whole. Strain the soaking liquid to remove any grit, and add it to the pan. Carry on cooking for about 20 minutes until most of the moisture disappears. Season to taste, and add your stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for around 20 minutes. I usually remove half the soup from the pan and whiz it up to a purée at this point, then pour it back in, adding the parsley and mascarpone, and seasoning carefully to taste. You can serve this soup as you like, but there are a few things to remember when finishing it off. Mix together a pinch of salt and pepper with the zest of one lemon and the juice of half of it, then spoon a little of this into the middle of the soup. When you go to eat it, stir it in and it gives a wonderful flavour. Other things you can consider are little slices of grilled crostini put into the bottom of the bowls before the soup is poured over. Or you could even quickly fry some nice-looking mushrooms - like girolles, chanterelles or oysters - and sprinkle these on top of the soup. If I was going to use truffle oil, then I would use it on its own - a few drips on the top just before serving.

The inspiration for this recipe came when I was in Japan and saw mushrooms being cooked completely dry on a barbecue or griddle pan. This way of cooking brings out a really fresh and nutty flavour in them; perfect for being dressed lightly with olive oil, salt and lemon juice or stirred into a risotto at the last minute before serving. Heat your stock in a saucepan and keep it on a low simmer. Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl and pour in just enough hot stock to cover. Leave for a couple of minutes until they've softened. Fish them out of the stock and chop them, reserving the soaking liquid. In a large pan, heat a lug of olive oil and add the onion and celery. Slowly fry without colouring them for at least 10 minutes, then turn the heat up and add the rice. Give it a stir. Stir in the vermouth or wine - it'll smell fantastic! Keep stirring until the liquid has cooked into the rice. Now pour the porcini soaking liquid through a sieve into the pan and add the chopped porcini, a good pinch of salt and your first ladle of hot stock. Turn the heat down to a simmer and keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. This will take about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, get a dry griddle pan hot and grill the wild mushrooms until soft. If your pan isn't big enough, do this in batches. Put them into a bowl and add the chopped herbs, a pinch of salt and the lemon juice. Using your hands, get stuck in and toss everything together - this is going to be incredible!, Take the risotto off the heat and check the seasoning carefully. Stir in the butter and the Parmesan. You want it to be creamy and oozy in texture, so add a bit more stock if you think it needs it. Put a lid on and leave the risotto to relax for about 3 minutes. Take your risotto and add a little more seasoning or Parmesan if you like. Serve a good dollop of risotto topped with some grilled dressed mushrooms, a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

Place the flour on a board or in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Beat the egg until smooth, then pour it into the well. Using the tips of your fingers, gradually mix the egg with the flour until combined. Knead the bits of dough into one smooth lump. You can also do this step in a food processor - just whiz the flour and egg until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip onto a work surface and bring together with your hands. Knead the dough to develop the gluten; this makes your pasta springy instead of flabby when you cook it. There's no secret to kneading - you just have to bash the dough around a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, stretching it and squashing it again. Stop when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky. Wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes. It's not the end of the world if you haven't got a pasta machine, just use your rolling pin. The problem you'll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces. You'll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than you'll get from aÂ machine. If using a machine, make sure it's firmly clamped to a clean, long work surface. Dust the surface with flour, then take a lump of dough the size of aÂ large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips. Set the pasta machine at its widest setting and roll the dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks. Click the machine down a setting and roll the dough through again. Fold the dough in half, click the machine back up to the widest setting and roll it through again. Repeat 5 or 6 times. Work the dough through all the machine's settings, from the widest to the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the dough with flour every time you run it through. When you reach the narrowest setting, fold the dough in half, then in half again, then once more into a squarish piece of dough. Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll through the settings for the last time, you should get a silky, rectangular sheet of pasta with straight edges. For the lasagne sheets needed in this recipe, keep rolling the pasta until it's somewhere between the thickness of a beer mat and aÂ playing card. Cut the pasta into 6 sheets of 8cm x 30cm, and cut the rest into 8cm xÂ 12cm sheets. ItÂ dries faster than you might think, so don't wait more than a minute or two to cut it. LayÂ aÂ damp tea towel onÂ top of the pasta to help prevent it drying out. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. For the béchamel sauce, place the milk and saffron in a saucepan and bring almost to the boil. In a second pan, melt 75g of the butter. Stir in the flour to make a paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the hot milk to the pan, a ladleful at a time, whisking as you go. Gently bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for around 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until you have aÂ thick, smooth sauce. Finely grate and stir inÂ most ofÂ the Parmesan and season well. Scrub and debeard the mussels, discarding any that remain open when tapped. Halve the sole fillets lengthways, then thinly slice the salmon. Melt the remaining butter in a large, deep frying pan. Peel, finely slice and fry the garlic over a medium heat for 1Â minute, or until golden. Add the rosemary sprigs and anchovies to the pan and fry for a few more minutes, or until the anchovies have dissolved. Add the mussels, shake the pan and cook, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes, orÂ until the mussels have all opened (throw away any that haven't after this time). Turn off the heat, then remove the mussels from their shells, putting the meat back into the pan (discard the shells). Stir to coat in the garlicky juices, discard the rosemary sprigs, then stir the mussel mixture through the béchamel sauce. Grease 6 individual baking dishes (measuring about 12cm x 16cm each) with a little oil and bring aÂ large pan of salted water to the boil. Cook the sheets of pasta, a few pieces at aÂ time, for about 1 minute. Remove with tongs and spread over a clean tea towel to drain. To assemble, place a long sheet of lasagne across each dish so that it overhangs the sides. Add a mixed layer of lemon sole and salmon, then spoon over a layer of the béchamel. Top with a smaller rectangle of pasta. Repeat until you get to the last of the béchamel sauce, then fold over the overhanging pasta to enclose. Top each lasagne with a king prawn, then scatter over the remaining Parmesan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling at the edges. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving."

Cook for 2 minutes, add the red onion mix and continue cooking until the liquid has reduced to almost nothing. Season to taste. Leave to cool to room temperature, then place in the fridge to chill. To make the stew, chop the tomatoes, pick and roughly chop the tarragon and chervil. Place the fish stock, tomatoes, half the tarragon, saffron, butter and 200ml of the shellfish stock in a pan. Bring to the boil, then reduce by three-quarters. Blitz in a food processor, pass through a sieve and keep it warm while you cook the shellfish. Place a large lidded pan over a high heat, add the mussels and cockles, pour in 100ml water and immediately put on the lid. Steam the mussels and cockles for 2 minutes to open them, then drain. Discard any that have not opened. Once they are cool enough to handle, pick the mussels and cockles from the shells (keep 18 in their shells for presentation), place on a plate, and leave in the fridge to chill. Reheat the oven to 200°C/gas 6. Heat a little olive oil in a non-stick pan over a medium heat, and add the cod (you can do this in batches). Cook for 1 to 2 minutes on one side, or until slightly golden, turn over, then transfer to a baking tray. Roast for 4 to 5 minutes, or until cooked through. While it's cooking, heat a little more olive oil to the pan over a medium heat, add the squid, and sauté for 2 minutes, or until just cooked. Bring the stew to the simmer, add the mussels and cockles and warm through. Remove the cod from the oven and place on a serving dish with a dollop of the marmalade. Pour over the stew liquor, spoon on the mussels and cockles and top with the squid, a scattering of tarragon and chervil and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve with the mayo, and some crusty bread."

(You can make of that what you will!). I was really surprised to find out that Nonno lives by himself, and I was very impressed to hear that he still cooks for himself every day; although there are always friends and family nearby to help him if he needs it. His favourite thing to cook for himself is mussels with pasta, so I'm going to talk you through the recipe as he explained it to me. Get a pan of salted water on to boil. Pour a few drizzles of extra virgin olive oil into a separate little pan and put it on a medium heat. Add the garlic, dried chilli and anchovy, then squeeze in and add the cherry tomatoes as the garlic begins to fry - at no point should the garlic take on any colour, but you need the heat to be hot enough to melt the anchovies. The juice from the tomatoes and oil will make a light, very delicate and simple sauce. Add the linguine to the pan of boiling water and cook according to packet instructions. Meanwhile, add a good handful of washed and debearded mussels to the tomato sauce. Give the pan a little toss, then place a lid on top and cook until all the mussels are open. As usual with mussels, if any remain closed after cooking, throw them away. Add a handful of chopped parsley to the pan. The pasta will now be a little under al dente and only a minute away from being ready. Nonno likes to drain his pasta, saving a little of the cooking water, then he puts the pasta back into the big pot and pours the mussel sauce over the top, mixing everything together well. Put the pot back on a low heat for an extra minute or two to cook the pasta perfectly - it will suck up all the lovely mussel juice. To finish, drizzle over a good bit of olive oil, season to taste and serve immediately."

Peel the husk from the corn and slice off the kernels with a sharp knife. Add the sweetcorn and potato to the saucepan, along with the stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 10 minutes, or until the potato is soft.

Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Halve, deseed and chop the butternut squash into big chunks and rub them with a little olive oil. Bash up the coriander seeds, fennel seeds and chilli in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Dust this mix over your pieces of squash, then put them into a snug-fitting ovenproof dish or roasting tray, covered with a dampened piece of greaseproof paper. Pop the tray into the oven for about 30 minutes, then remove the paper and let the squash roast for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden. While this is cooking, pick the marjoram or oregano leaves, discarding the stalks, and peel and finely slice the garlic. Get a large pan nice and hot and add a little olive oil, the herb leaves and sliced garlic. Move it all around for 20 seconds, then add the spinach. Water will cook out of it as it heats up - this is fine, though, as we will cook it away. Using a pair of tongs, keep the spinach moving quickly around the pan, then after a minute add a couple of knobs of butter and a good grating of nutmeg and stir it around a bit more. Keep cooking until the moisture has cooked away then season to taste and allow to cool. To roll out your pasta either use a pasta machine to give you 4 or 5 long sheets (15cm x 30cm wide) and stick them together using a little water, or you can do what I do and use a rolling pin on a large surface, dusting with flour on top of and underneath the dough. Have a go at both ways. Keep it in a rectangular shape but trim it as necessary. Roll out to the thickness of a beer mat and the size of a tea towel, then lay it out on top of a clean tea towel. Once you've done this, spoon a line of squash along the long edge of the sheet nearest you. Sprinkle the spinach over the rest of the sheet, leaving the top 5cm of the pasta sheet clear. Crumble the ricotta over the spinach, finely grate over the Parmesan and you're ready to begin rolling!, Brush the last clear edge of the pasta sheet with a little water then, working carefully, use the nearest edge of the tea towel to roll the pasta up and away from you, like a Swiss roll. Roll the rotolo up in the tea towel and tie it firmly at each end using some string. You can secure the sausage shape even further by tying some more round the middle if you want. Tie a little extra string at one end so it can hang out of the cooking pot and act as a handle. Now, to cook the rotolo, get your fish kettle or very large pan with a lid and fill it with boiling salted water. Lower the rotolo in and use the fish kettle rack on top to keep it submerged. If using a saucepan, hold the rotolo down with a plate. Simmer for about 25 minutes. While it's cooking, you need to clarify some butter. To do this, take the remaining butter and place it in an ovenproof dish in the oven on a low plate-warming temperature (80°C). Over the next 10 to 15 minutes it will melt and you'll see that the milky whey will sink to the bottom. Discard any white bits floating on the top, then spoon out the clear golden butter and put to one side. Discard the whey. You won't need all the butter now, but it's quite hard to clarify any less than this - you can leave the extra in the fridge to use for your roast potatoes another day. Now you've removed the whey from the butter, you can heat it up more aggressively. So put about 3 tablespoons of your clarified butter into a pan and heat it up. Test to see if the butter is hot enough by adding a sage leaf to it. If it fries nicely, add the rest of the leaves and fry for about 30 seconds until they begin to crisp up. Then remove from the heat and put to one side. When the rotolo is ready, carefully remove it from the pan, take the string off, unroll it and slice it up - a couple of slices per portion. Scatter a few sage leaves over the top, drizzle with a little of your sage-flavoured butter, and finish off with a grating of Parmesan. Unbelievable!"

Pour over the balsamic and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, toss to coat, then strip over half the thyme leaves, reserving any pretty tips. Cover with a sheet of wet scrunched-up greaseproof paper and roast for 1 hour. Prick the potatoes and dry-roast in a separate tray alongside until cooked through, then remove. Once cool enough to handle, scoop the potatoes out of their skins and mash the insides in a bowl. Finely chop the radicchio and onion, then stir into the potato with 1 tablespoon of the balsamic juices from the tray. Finely grate in most of the Parmesan and all the fontina, mix well, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Leave to cool completely. On a clean flour-dusted surface, roll out the pasta dough so it's 1mm thick and roughly 16cm wide (the width of a standard pasta machine). Spoon heaped teaspoons of filling evenly down the pasta strips, slightly off centre, leaving a 5cm gap between each. Brush the exposed pasta lightly with water and fold the sheets in half over the filling. Gently seal around the filling, pushing out the air - you can cut them into 8cm circles with a pastry cutter or into squares with a knife. Place them on a semolina-dusted tray as you go - you'll get about 18 ravioli in total. Toast the hazelnuts in a large frying pan on a medium heat until golden, then lightly bash and tip into a bowl. Cook the ravioli two portions at a time in a pan of boiling salted water for 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, place the frying pan back on a low heat and add a splash of olive oil, a third of the butter, and a third of the remaining thyme leaves and tips.

Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, then reduce the heat to a rolling simmer. Carefully lower in the ravioli, two or three at a time, and cook for 4 minutes, or until they float. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. As soon as it foams, finely grate in the lemon zest and add a squeeze of juice plus a pinch of pepper. Remove the pasta with a slotted spoon straight into the butter sauce, adding a splash of pasta water and grating in the remaining Parmesan. Cook the next batch of ravioli, then add to the sauce. Dress the frisée with half the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of oil, tear in the prosciutto, then season with pepper and mix together. Divide the ravioli between your plates, arrange the frisée salad around it, then serve with a good grating of Parmesan."

Place the flour on a board or in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Beat the egg until smooth, then pour it into the well. Using the tips of your fingers, gradually mix the egg with the flour until combined. Knead the bits of dough into one smooth lump. You can also do this step in a food processor - just whiz the flour and egg until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip onto a work surface and bring together with your hands. Knead the dough to develop the gluten; this makes your pasta springy instead of flabby when you cook it. There's no secret to kneading - you just have to bash the dough around a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, stretching it and squashing it again. Stop when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky. Wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes. It's not the end of the world if you haven't got a pasta machine, just use a rolling pin. The problem you'll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces. You'll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than you'll get from aÂ machine. If using a machine, make sure it's firmly clamped to a clean, long work surface. Dust the surface with flour, then take a lump of dough the size of aÂ large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips. Set the pasta machine at its widest setting and roll the dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks. Click the machine down a setting and roll the dough through again. Fold the dough in half, click the machine back up to the widest setting and roll it through again. Repeat 5 or 6 times. Work the dough through all the machine's settings, from the widest to the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the dough with flour every time you run it through. When you reach the narrowest setting, fold the dough in half, then in half again, then once more into a squarish piece of dough. Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll through the settings for the last time, you should get a silky, rectangular sheet of pasta with straight edges. For the lasagne sheets needed in these recipes, keep rolling the pasta until it's somewhere between the thickness of a beer mat and aÂ playing card. Cut the pasta into 10cm xÂ 20cm sheets. ItÂ dries faster than you might think, so don't wait more than a minute or two to cut it. LayÂ aÂ damp tea towel onÂ top of the pasta to help prevent it drying out. Peel and finely slice the garlic. Peel all the onions, finely chop 3 and cut the remaining onion into wedges. Trim and finely chop the celery and carrots, and pick and finely chop the rosemary. Heat a good lug of oil in a large, deep saucepan. Fry the garlic over aÂ medium heat for 1 minute, or until golden. Add the finely chopped onions to the pan with the carrot and celery. Fry over a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the veg are soft but not coloured. Add the rosemary, oregano, tomatoes, wine and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and bring to the boil, breaking up the tomatoes with a spoon. Reduce the heat and leave toÂ simmer for 1 hour, or until thickened. Chop up the meat or pulse in a food processor, then stir into the ragÃ¹ for the final 15Â minutes, or until the meat is heated through and the sauce is thick, rich and glossy. Stir the sauce regularly and loosen with a splash of boiling water from the kettle if it's too thick for your liking. When the ragÃ¹ is almost there, preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 and start your béchamel sauce. Pour the milk into a large saucepan over a low heat. Add the peppercorns and the remaining onion and gently bring almost to the boil. Melt the butter in aÂ second saucepan. Stir in the flour toÂ create a paste and cook over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Whisk in the hot milk, aÂ ladleful at a time (discard the onion and peppercorns). Gently bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until you have a thick, smooth sauce. Grate and stir in most of the Parmesan and season to taste. Grease a large rectangular or round baking dish with a little oil and bring aÂ pan of salted water to the boil. Add the lasagne sheets to the pan, aÂ few sheets at a time, and cook for 1Â minute or so per batch. Remove the pasta with tongs and spread out on aÂ clean tea towel to drain. Drape a single layer of lasagne over the base of the baking dish. Spread over a thin layer of ragÃ¹, top with another layer of pasta and then spread over a thin layer of béchamel sauce. Repeat as many times as you can (6 to 8, ideally), finishing with a layer of pasta topped with béchamel sauce. Tear over the mozzarella, then finish with the remaining grated Parmesan and a drizzle of oil. Pick and scatter over the basil leaves. Bake the lasagne in the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden on top and bubbling at the edges. Let stand for 5Â minutes before serving."

Beat the eggs in a large bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan. Season with a little salt and a good twist of pepper. Whisk well, then stir in your pasta. To cook the frittata, heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a 26cm non-stick ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Add the frittata mixture and cook for about 5 minutes, or until crisp underneath, then place in the oven for another 5 minutes, or until firm. Carefully flip the frittata onto a large plate, then slide it back into the pan and return it to the oven for a further 5 minutes, or until crisp underneath. Serve with an extra grating of Parmesan. If you've got about 400g of leftover cooked pasta that is already coated in sauce, you can swap that in for an easy twist on my basic recipe. Or try making a pizzaiola pasta frittata - make the basic pasta frittata (I like to use fusilli, but use whatever shape you have), then serve by slicing and layering over 6 ripe cherry tomatoes and 40g of fontina cheese. Scatter over a few fresh basil leaves, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan. If it's springtime, make the basic recipe extra special by adding peas and pancetta. Heat 1Â½ tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a 26cm non-stick ovenproof frying pan. Peel, finely slice and add 1 onion, then sweat for a few minutes. Very finely slice 6 higher-welfare slices of pancetta and add to the pan for a further 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 200g of peas, pour in 400ml of hot water, then turn the heat up to high and bring to the boil. Leave it to simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated, then cool. Make the basic pasta frittata mixture, finely chop and add the leaves from 4 sprigs of fresh mint,, squeeze in the juice from 1 lemon, then stir in the cooled pea mixture. Cook your frittata as above, and serve with an extra grating of Parmesan. Tip: Pasta frittata is delicious served hot or cold - I like to wrap it up to have as a snack during a long walk or a day out foraging in the woods or, take it out for a picnic."

Swiftly plunge the lobster head first into the water, place the lid on and cook for 8 minutes (or slightly less if you're using 2 small ones). Remove and leave to cool. Peel and finely chop the onions and garlic. Get yourself a large ovenproof casserole pan (ideally 30cm wide and 10cm deep) that you want to serve up in.

Squeeze the tail shell in until you hear it crack, then rip it open the other way to expose all that lovely tail meat. Rip the claws off the body, then use a rolling pin on a board to crack them open and poke out any meat you can find. Roughly chop all the meat, reserving the tail, shell and head.

Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to packet instructions, then drain, reserving a little cooking water. Remove the sauce from the heat, stir in the pasta and lobster meat and grate in the Cheddar and GruyeÌ€re. Mix well, taste and correct the seasoning - you don't want the sauce to be super-thick now, so loosen it with a little cooking water if needed, remembering that it will thicken as it bakes. Finely grate over the Parmesan (I didn't do it in the picture, but you can add a sprinkling of breadcrumbs before the cheese too, if you like). For a bit of fun, pop the lobster head and tail into the pan at either end. Cook in the oven for about 35 minutes, or until golden, bubbling and delicious. Serve with a smile, a big seasonal salad, and a glass of cold Soave.

Check the tomato sauce - it should look rich and glossy and the tomatoes should be soft and squashy. Carefully pick out and discard the vine, leaving the tomatoes in the pan. Gently stir in the brown crabmeat and let it heat up. Finely chop the parsley leaves. Drain the pasta, reserving a cupful of cooking water, then gently fold it through the ragÃ¹ with the white crabmeat and the chopped parsley, adding a little of the reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce if needed. Serve the pasta on a lovely big platter with the fennel salad bang on top so you can mix and toss the two together as you serve. Chop the remaining lemon into wedges and serve on the side for squeezing over. The mix of flavours is a knockout!"

Tip out onto a flour-dusted surface and knead for 3 to 5 minutes, or until smooth. Cut the dough into four pieces, then carefully press a portion out flat with your fingertips and start to roll it out using a pasta machine. Start at the widest setting and roll the dough through it, lightly dusting with the rice flour if it sticks. Roll the pasta through the widest setting a second time, then click the machine down a setting and roll the dough through again. Now, start clicking the settings down, rolling the pasta through each setting twice - gluten-free pasta isn't as elastic as standard pasta, so make sure you avoid using the two narrowest settings, otherwise it may rip. Once you have a thin sheet of pasta (about 2mm thick), set aside on a flour-dusted surface and cover with a damp tea towel to avoid it drying out, then continue with the remaining dough. Now's the time to transform your dough into whichever variety of pasta you like. If you want to make tagliatelle, roll the pasta through the tagliatelle setting on your pasta machine, or use a sharp knife to slice the pasta sheets lengthways into long strips (roughly 7mm thick), placing on a flour-dusted tray as you go. To cook, place in a pan of boiling salted water for around 3 minutes, or until al dente, then serve how you like it."

Feel free to use tagliatelle as well. Blanch and skin the tomatoes, then halve them and chop into small pieces. Put a pan of salted water on to heat for the pasta. Put a couple of lugs of olive oil in a second pan, and fry the prawns, garlic, lemon zest and tomatoes for a couple of minutes. Add the booze and allow to flame if you like.

Season the sauce carefully with salt, pepper and the lemon juice. Put the pasta into the boiling water â€” fresh will need only 3 minutes and dried will need to be cooked according to the packet instructions. If your sauce has cooled down then reheat it now.

Serve straight away, telling your guests to stir the pasta up in their bowls every so often to keep the pasta moist. Try this: Crumble over a little ricotta or feta cheese - just a little bit - both of these cheeses have a nice texture, go really well with prawns and make it look great.

What you should have now is a reasonably thick sauce, which you should think of more as a dressing, so taste it and think about how the different flavours are coming through. I want you to balance the flavours so you end up with something quite zingy because, as the sauce heats up and the cheese melts, the flavour of the lemon will calm down a lot. Season with some freshly ground black pepper. Taste it and if you think you haven't got the balance right, simply add a little more oil and Parmesan. Put a large pot of salted water on to boil for your pasta. Sit the sauce bowl on top of the pan while the water's heating up - this will take the chill out of the sauce and warm it through slightly. When the water starts to boil, remove the bowl and add your pasta to the water. Cook it according to the packet instructions then drain in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water. Toss the pasta with the sauce and a little of the reserved cooking water to help loosen it up a bit. The heat from the pasta will melt the cheese, allowing all the lovely sauce to coat it. If you find the sauce is too thick then add a little more water. It's not supposed to be claggy, thick and miserable, but incredibly silky, fresh and fragrant.

I've used sweet tomatoes in my recipe as they really complement the cheese, and instead of béchamel sauce I've used single cream as it's a lot lighter. I've also topped the dish off with cheesy breadcrumbs, which give it a wonderful crunch. I think you'll laugh when you see how easy it is to make. I put it together extremely quickly by using my Magimix food processor. Don't worry if you haven't got one - you can chop it all up by hand instead and then mix it in a bowl. Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Get a pan of salted boiling water going and cook your macaroni according to the packet instructions. Meanwhile, break your bread up, place it in the food processor and whiz it up to form breadcrumbs. Set aside. Wash your tomatoes and place them in the food processor with the garlic, basil, sun-dried tomatoes, anchovies and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Whiz up for 30 seconds. Then add 2 handfuls of the Parmesan, the cream, vinegar and grated nutmeg. Whiz until smooth and season carefully to taste so it's really yummy!, By this time your macaroni will probably be cooked, so drain it in a colander, saving some of the cooking water. Place the pasta back into the pan and pour over every last bit of the cheesy sauce. You want it to be quite loose because you'll be surprised how quickly the sauce will disappear inside the macaroni and will look dry. So add a few spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water. Now you need to get yourself a baking dish about 8-10cm deep - this could be an earthenware dish or even a shallow ovenproof pan. Pour the pasta straight into your baking dish and break the mozzarella into little pieces over the top. Mix the last handful of Parmesan with the thyme leaves and breadcrumbs and sprinkle evenly over the top of the dish. Drizzle generously with good extra virgin olive oil - this will give you a lovely crunch topping. Place in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until piping hot and golden on top.

Keep frying and turning the meatballs until they're golden brown and cooked through. Meanwhile, put the spaghetti into a large pan of salted boiling water and cook according to the packet instructions until al dente. To make your tomato sauce, heat a separate pan and pour in some olive oil. Add the garlic and the chopped basil stalks and move them around the pan for a couple of minutes. Put some small basil leaves to one side for later, and sprinkle the rest into the pan. Add the tomatoes and season carefully to taste. Bring to a simmer, break up your tomatoes a bit more with a spoon and add a swig of balsamic vinegar - it's lovely for adding sweetness to the sauce. Add the herbs to the pan of sausage meatballs, tossing everything in all the lovely flavours. Cook for around 30 seconds. When your spaghetti is cooked, drain it and divide the pasta and meatballs between four bowls. Spoon over the tomato sauce.

This way you'll get the right cover of sauce and the right amount of crispiness on top. When I cook this at home I just use one pan to cut down on lots of washing up!, Take your metal tray or a saucepan, put it on a high heat and add your butter, a drizzle of olive oil, one of the sliced garlic cloves, a handful of marjoram or oregano and the grated nutmeg. By the time the pan is hot the garlic should be soft. Put as much spinach as will fit into the pan. Keep turning it over; it will wilt quickly so you will be able to keep adding more spinach until it's all in. Moisture will cook out of the spinach, which is fine. By cooking it this way you don't lose any of the nutrients that you would if boiling it in water. After 5 minutes, put the spinach into a large bowl and leave to cool. Place the pan back on the heat, add a little olive oil, the other clove of sliced garlic, your basil stalks and the tomatoes, then fill one of the empty tomato tins with cold water and add this too. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down, add a pinch of salt and pepper and the sugar, and simmer for about 10 minutes, until you get a loose tomato sauce consistency. Then take the pan off the heat and add the basil leaves. By now the spinach will have cooled down, so squeeze any excess liquid out of it and pour this back into the bowl. Finely chop the spinach and put it back into the bowl. Mix it with the liquid, add the ricotta and a handful of the Parmesan, and then use a piping bag to squeeze the mixture into the cannelloni. You can make your own piping bag by getting a sandwich bag and putting the spinach mix into the corner of it. Then twist the bag up and cut the corner off. Carefully squeeze the filling into the cannelloni tubes so each one is filled right up - really easy. Lay the cannelloni over the tomato sauce in the pan. Or you can pour the tomato sauce into your ovenproof dish and lay the cannelloni on top. To make the white sauce, mix together the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che, anchovies and the 2 handfuls of Parmesan with a little salt and pepper, then loosen with a little water until you can spoon it over the cannelloni.

Make a well in the centre and crack the eggs into it. Beat the eggs with a fork until smooth. Using the tips of your fingers, mix the eggs with the flour, incorporating a little at a time, until everything is combined. Knead the pieces of dough together - with a bit of work and some love and attention they'll all bind together to give you one big, smooth lump of dough!, Once you've made your dough you need to knead and work it with your hands to develop the gluten in the flour, otherwise your pasta will be flabby and soft when you cook it, instead of springy and al dente. There's no secret to kneading. You just have to bash the dough about a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, pulling it, stretching it, squashing it again. It's quite hard work, and after a few minutes it's easy to see why the average Italian grandmother has arms like Frank Bruno! You'll know when to stop - it's when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky instead of rough and floury. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and put it in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes - make sure the clingfilm covers it well or it will dry out and go crusty round the edges (this will give you crusty lumps through your pasta when you roll it out, and nobody likes crusty lumps!). How to roll your pasta: first of all, if you haven't got a pasta machine it's not the end of the world! All the mammas I met while travelling round Italy rolled pasta with their trusty rolling pins and they wouldn't even consider having a pasta machine in the house! When it comes to rolling, the main problem you'll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. It's quite difficult to get a big lump of dough rolled out in one piece, and you need a very long rolling pin to do the job properly. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces of pasta rather than a few big ones. You'll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than the long rectangular shapes you'll get from a machine, but use your head and you'll be all right!, If using a machine to roll your pasta, make sure it's clamped firmly to a clean work surface before you start (use the longest available work surface you have). If your surface is cluttered with bits of paper, the kettle, the bread bin, the kids' homework and stuff like that, shift all this out of the way for the time being. It won't take a minute, and starting with a clear space to work in will make things much easier, I promise. Dust your work surface with some Tipo 00 flour, take a lump of pasta dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips. Set the pasta machine at its widest setting - and roll the lump of pasta dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks at all. Click the machine down a setting and roll the pasta dough through again. Fold the pasta in half, click the pasta machine back up to the widest setting and roll the dough through again. Repeat this process five or six times. It might seem like you're getting nowhere, but in fact you're working the dough, and once you've folded it and fed it through the rollers a few times, you'll feel the difference. It'll be smooth as silk and this means you're making wicked pasta!, Now it's time to roll the dough out properly, working it through all the settings on the machine, from the widest down to around the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the pasta with a little flour every time you run it through. When you've got down to the narrowest setting, to give yourself a tidy sheet of pasta, fold the pasta in half lengthways, then in half again, then in half again once more until you've got a square-ish piece of dough. Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll it down through the settings for the last time, you should end up with a lovely rectangular silky sheet of dough with straight sides - just like a real pro! If your dough is a little cracked at the edges, fold it in half just once, click the machine back two settings and feed it through again. That should sort things out. Whether you're rolling by hand or by machine you'll need to know when to stop. If you're making pasta like tagliatelle, lasagne or stracchi you'll need to roll the pasta down to between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card; if you're making a stuffed pasta like ravioli or tortellini, you'll need to roll it down slightly thinner or to the point where you can clearly see your hand or lines of newsprint through it. Once you've rolled your pasta the way you want it, you need to shape or cut it straight away. Pasta dries much quicker than you think, so whatever recipe you're doing, don't leave it more than a minute or two before cutting or shaping it. You can lay over a damp clean tea towel which will stop it from drying."

Place a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat with 4 tablespoons of olive oil. As soon as the oil starts to shimmer, pour it into the heatproof bowl to make a fragrant oil. When the sizzling subsides, add the soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar, then leave to sit - the flavour will get better and better. Return the pan to a medium-low heat and add the pork, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Cook for 5 minutes stirring occasionally, until golden and crispy. To make the noodles, pile the flour into a mixing bowl and slowly add 300ml of water to bring it together into a dough. Knead for just a couple of minutes, or until soft, shiny and elastic. On a flour-dusted surface, use a rolling pin to roll out the pasta to about 2mm thick - don't worry if it tears or looks wonky, this dough is very forgiving. Dust it well with flour, then loosely roll it up. Use a sharp knife to slice it at 2cm intervals, then toss it with your hands to separate the strands. Meanwhile, pop a large pan of salted water on to boil. Cut the broccoli into mouth-sized florets, cracking open any big ones (this will help with cooking time), then finely slice the stalk. Halve the onion, finely chop and use it in 2 ways - add Â¾ to the pork now, and add the remaining to a bowl with a splash of vinegar and some salt to make a quick pickle to be used as a garnish. When the pork is golden, increase the heat to medium-high, and stir through the remaining ginger and garlic. Add the broccoli to the salted water and cook for 5 minutes, with the lid on, then remove with a slotted spoon. Return the salted water back to the boil. Add the noodles, give them a stir and cook with the lid on for 3 minutes. At the last minute, stir the honey through the pork (this will stop it burning) to give the meat sweetness and shine, then remove from the heat. When the noodles are cooked, drain and toss them with the broccoli and the flavoured oil and divide between plates. Pour over the pork juices and scatter over the crispy pork bits from a height. Bash up and sprinkle over the peanuts, scatter with the quick-pickled onions, and serve straight away."

Add more water to the wok during cooking if needed - just be careful the steam doesn't burn you. You can test if the cakes are cooked by pressing the tops - if they feel firm and springy and your finger doesn't sink in, then they're cooked. If the cakes give slightly, leave them in the steamer for an extra 10 minutes or so. (You can also insert a skewer into the middle of the cakes and if it comes out clean then they're cooked.), Allow the cakes to cool completely in the tins before gently tipping them out and slicing them into sections. Typically the cakes are served as 8cm squares, but for a party it's also nice to slice them into smaller (4cm), bite-size cubes. Place a wok over a medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of peanut oil and stir-fry the cake cubes until all the sides are nicely brown and crispy. Transfer to a serving plate. In a small serving bowl, combine both chilli sauces. Serve the turnip cake cubes sprinkled with the finely chopped chives, with the chilli dipping sauce on the side."

Peel and finely slice the onions, then place in a frying pan with 1 tablespoon of oil and cook gently over a medium heat for 30 minutes, or until dark, sweet and sticky. Pick and finely chop the sage leaves, then roughly chop the bacon and add both to the pan after 10 minutes. Once cooked, add the onion mixture to a large bowl and leave to cool. Shred the turkey and add to the bowl, then finely grate over half the nutmeg. Add the remaining filling ingredients and mix together well. To make the pastry, place the flour into a large bowl. Put the dripping and 300ml of water in a small pan over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until melted. Bring to the boil, then stir straight into the flour. Leave until warm and pliable, but cool enough to handle. Knead the pastry until smooth, then cut off a quarter, wrap it in clingfilm and reserve for the top of your pie. Working quickly, while the dough is still pliable, press it evenly over the base and up the sides of a 23cm loose-bottomed cake tin, until it's about 1cm thick, patching up any holes as you go - you may not need all of the pastry. Place the tin on a baking tray and fill the pastry case with the cooled filling, then roll out the reserved pastry and place it on top, pinching the edges to seal and create a crust. Gently press down the top of the pie to create a slight indent to hold the cranberry topping. Using the handle of a wooden spoon, carefully pierce a hole in the centre of the pie lid to allow the steam to escape, then bake the pie for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 160°C/325°F/gas 3 and cook for a further 2 hours 30 minutes. Carefully remove the pie from the oven, brush the top with beaten egg and pop it back in the oven for another 20 minutes, or until perfectly golden, then leave the pie to cool completely. To make the gravy, soak the gelatine in cold water for 5 minutes, then remove and squeeze out the excess water. In a pan, bring the stock almost to the boil, then remove from the heat and whisk in the gelatine. Leave to cool to room temperature. Using a small funnel, pour the gravy into the pie through the hole in the top, adding just a little at a time and allowing each addition to sink in before adding the next. To make the cranberry topping, place all the cranberries in a pan. Using a speed-peeler, strip in the orange zest, then squeeze in the all juice. Add the remaining topping ingredients, except for the sage, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thickened, stirring regularly. Taste and add a little extra sugar, if needed, then remove the cinnamon stick, cloves and orange peel. Leave to cool and thicken for 45 minutes, then spoon it on top of the pie. Place in the fridge overnight to set. Just before serving, pick the sage leaves, and fry over a medium-high heat until crispy, then scatter over the pie."

Put 1 teaspoon of filling in the middle of the circle. Fold it into a half-moon shape, pushing one side into small pleats as you press the edges together to seal - this creates the classic â€˜har kau' shape. To fold your dumplings into rabbits, gently press and elongate the sealed edge by about 2cm, then snip in half with scissors. Fold each side of them back and pinch so that they resemble bunny ears. Make two dimples in the front of the dumpling and add a black sesame seed or dab of food colouring into each one to make the eyes. Set a steamer basket over a pan of boiling water.

Peel and roughly chop the ginger and garlic, pound into the mortar with the turmeric, then muddle in 1 tablespoon of oil and the vinegar. Using a sharp knife, chop the pork belly into rough 2cm chunks. Return the pan to a medium-high heat with the pork and season with a little sea salt. Fry for 15 minutes, or until golden all over. Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the onions. Once the pork is golden, add the curry leaves and three-quarters of the curry paste to the pan (save the rest for another day). Toss well, then add the onions and cook for a further 15 minutes, or until golden, stirring occasionally. Finely chop the fresh chillies, then stir into the pan with the tamarind paste and sugar. Transfer to the oven for around 25 minutes, or until darkened. Take the pan out of the oven and skim away any excess fat (store in an airtight jar in the fridge for epic roasties another day). Place the pan on a high heat, add 600ml of boiling water and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Place the charcoal and cinnamon stick over a direct flame on the hob, turning with tongs until the charcoal starts to smoke and turn white. Place both in a small heatproof bowl with the cloves, then sit the bowl directly in the middle of the vindaloo pan (like you see in the picture). Drizzle over a drop of oil until the charcoal starts to smoke like incense. Carefully cover the pan with a double layer of tin foil and poke a hole in the top to allow the smoke to escape. Put the curry back in the oven and cook for around 20 minutes, or until the meat is tender; or, if you prefer it falling apart, cook it for 1 hour longer, topping up with water if it gets too dry. Remove the charcoal bowl before serving. I like to dish up with homemade naan breads, a simple baby gem salad and raita."

Fish out the star anise, transfer the mixture to a blender and blitz until smooth, loosening with a splash of water, if needed, then pass through a fine sieve so it's super-super-smooth. Have a taste and season if required. Trim the spring onions and deseed the chillies, then finely slice both lengthways and put them into a bowl of ice-cold water so they curl up. For a laugh you can randomly score the radishes and pop them into the water for a bit of a naff 80s feel; otherwise, leave them whole or cut them into quarters. When the time's up, transfer the ribs to the tray, discarding the foil, and turn the oven up to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Brush a good layer of glaze over the ribs and return them to the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, then I like to keep brushing on glaze and popping them back into the oven every minute after that for a few more minutes, to build up a really good layer of dark, sticky glaze. Serve the ribs with a bowl of any leftover glaze for dunking, and with the radishes, chillies and spring onions on the side.

I love it when it's layered up like this, with the tomato sauce and cheese, then baked in the oven to gratinate. Feel free to swap veal for pork leg or even chicken that's been battered out. If you want to spike this with a bit of extra flavour you could also add a few capers or olives to the tomato sauce. Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Pick the leaves off the sprigs of basil and put them into a small bowl of water to keep them fresh. Finely chop the tender stalks. Put a pan on a medium heat and add a splash of olive oil, the chopped basil stalks, garlic and anchovies and cook for a few minutes. Prick the chilli a few times and add it to the pan. Allow everything to sizzle for a minute or so, then pour in the tinned tomatoes. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer for 20 minutes. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper. Meanwhile, prepare your escalopes. Mix the breadcrumbs in a bowl with the thyme leaves and Parmesan. Finely grate your lemon zest into the breadcrumbs, mix again, then lay out three plates in front of you. Put the flour on one and season it with salt and pepper, pour the eggs on to the next plate and put the herby breadcrumbs on the third. Dip the escalopes, one at a time, into the flour until well coated. Shake off any excess, then dip into the egg. Let the extra egg drip off, then lay the escalope in the breadcrumb mixture. Sprinkle a handful of crumbs over the top and press them down. Make a real point of getting breadcrumbs on to every part of the escalope. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a good splash of olive oil. Let it heat up a bit, then add your escalopes. If your pan isn't big enough, you may have to cook them in batches, adding a little extra oil if needed. Cook for a few minutes on each side until lightly golden, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain. Get yourself a snug-fitting, appropriately sized baking dish (approx. 30 x 20cm) and spread the tomato sauce in the dish. Lay your escalopes on top, side by side. Tear the buffalo mozzarella into pieces and dot these over the dish with a few basil leaves. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes until golden, bubbling and deliciously cooked. Sprinkle the rest of the basil leaves over. Perfect with a crunchy zingy salad, but in America they'd also serve it with things like spaghetti, rice or mashed potatoes, polenta or crusty bread."

Have a taste and add some seasoning to the point where it's delicious. Pop the lid on the pan to keep the grits warm while you crack on. PRAWN & SAUSAGE TOPPING Get a large frying pan on a medium heat. Squeeze the sausages out of their skins bit by bit and roll the meat into little 2cm balls. Don't go getting fancy, just pack them into roundish shapes. Once you've done that with all your sausages, turn the heat up under the pan and add the meatballs to the pan with a few lugs of olive oil. Shake the pan every now and then, and after 4 or 5 minutes the meatballs should be looking gorgeous all over. Add your prawns and chopped garlic and sprinkle in your smoked paprika. Give everything a good shake and within about 2 minutes the prawns will be perfectly cooked, so add a knob of butter and cook for another minute or two, shaking and stirring every 10 seconds or so. Take the pan off the heat, squeeze in the juice of your lemon, add your chopped parsley and season to taste with a pinch of salt and pepper. TO SERVE Let everything mix together, and stir around to pick up any flavours from the bottom of the pan. Have a taste and check you're happy with it.

You see, we've become attracted to breeds of pigs that grow very fast to be butchered and sold on ASAP, whereas our old farming methods used breeds that are now considered rare. They take longer to grow to maturity, which gives the meat a fantastic depth of flavour and plenty of snowy white, waxy fat that just melts in the pan. Once you've tried that, everything else comes second best. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Parboil your potatoes in salted boiling water for around 15 minutes until tender, then drain. Score the pork skin, season it and put it in a hot roasting tray with a drizzle of olive oil. As it begins to crisp up, add your potatoes and thyme. Toss once or twice (making sure the crackling ends up on top of the potatoes so it crisps up even more) and put in the oven for around 15 minutes until cooked. Meanwhile, pound up your fennel seeds and bay leaves in a pestle and mortar with 2 tablespoons of salt until you have a fine green moist paste. Shake this through a sieve into a bowl - this will stop it from sticking together in lumps. Pat your pork chops with a little oil - this will stop them sticking to the pan. Season the pork chops on both sides with the herb salt and keep any excess to use another day. Preheat your griddle pan until really hot. Don't add any extra oil to the pan - if you do it will start to smoke. Add your pork chops, and cook for around 3-4 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the pork. Try to avoid the temptation to overcook them. Once cooked allow to rest for about 4 minutes. Heat a little pan and add the cider and mustard. Bring to the boil, then reduce by half and add the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che. Bring back to the boil and reduce again until the sauce thickens, then remove from the heat. Add the butter and shake the pan around a bit so the sauce thickens and shines. Season to taste. Serve up the potatoes - I like to bash up half of them so they kind of smash and crumble - with the pork, a lovely piece of crackling and any resting juices from the meat. Drizzle over the cider sauce and eat - what a pleasure. Nice with a simple green salad and a pint of cider."

Put the meat in a high-sided roasting tray and cook in the preheated oven for 30 minutes to start the skin crisping up. Remove the meat from the oven, turning the heat down to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Take the pork out of the tray and put it to one side, then spoon out half the fat and discard it. Place the tray on the hob, add the onions, whole chillies, chorizo, bay leaves and rosemary with the remaining paprika, and fry gently until the onions are soft. Add all the tomatoes, the beans, garlic, parsley and a wineglass of water to the tray, stirring and scraping up all the lovely sticky bits from the bottom. Place the pork on top, return to the oven and cook for another hour or so or until the skin is crispy and the meat is meltingly tender. When cooked, remove the pork from the tray and allow to rest. Taste the sauce and season with salt, pepper and a few swigs of red wine vinegar to give it a twang. Then remove the chillies and control the heat by chopping up as much chilli as you like and stirring it back into the sauce. Lovely served with soured cream."

But even though a whole roasted shoulder is really impressive, it's actually a â€˜slam and go' recipe. Of course it's lovely served with roast potatoes and orchard apple sauce, but lately, I've been pulling all the meat apart and tossing it through this great jerk salsa - hell, yeah! The flavours of Jamaica and Britain really work well together - and actually many of the same spices found in jerk can also be found in some of the most quintessentially British puddings, syrups and even our beloved mulled wine. This is my version of jerk-dressed pork, and I love it. Preheat the oven to full whack (about 240°C/475°F/gas 9). Carefully score the skin and fat on the shoulder into zigzags about 1cm deep, using a very sharp knife or a clean Stanley knife. Sprinkle and rub in a good pinch of salt, pepper, dried rosemary, thyme, and a few good gratings of nutmeg. Add a lug of olive oil, then rub those flavours all over the meat and into the scores. Place the pork, skin side up, in your largest roasting pan. Pour one of the bottles of cider into the bottom of the tray, put into the hot oven for 30 minutes so the crackling gets going, then turn the heat down to 130°C/250°F/gas Â½. After the pork has been in for an hour, add the rest of the cider and cook for a further 6 to 7 hours, or until the meat pulls apart easily. Halfway through the cooking time cover with a double layer of tin foil. Once the pork is perfectly cooked, move it to a large serving board or platter. Carefully pour any fat from the roasting tray into a Kilner jar for some lucky roast potato some day, but leave the wonderful flavourful cooking juices in the pan. Then add the Scotch bonnets to a liquidizer with the spring onions, spices, the juice from the limes, ginger, bay leaves, garlic, a squeeze of honey and 2 lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Pulse together until you get a salsa consistency, then mix the salsa into the juices in the roasting tray, have a taste and balance out the salt and acid if needed. It should have attitude and loads of personality. Pour that salsa on to a platter, then pull the crispy crackling off the shoulder, get rid of any flobbery fat underneath, and use two forks to roughly pull the meat apart. Pile the meat on top of the salsa and toss together quickly. Tear over any coriander leaves and snap those wonderful zigzags of crackling on top of the meat and serve with good quality apple sauce. Rock 'n' roll!"

It's a great thing to serve at a party because when you've grilled it on all sides for 15 minutes you can just pop it into a hot oven for an hour quite happily and leave it - and you can serve it as a hot roast or have it cold. My boss at the River Café, Rose Gray, used to baste her grilled pork with herb vinegar and bay leaves, which was a tremendous combination, so feel free to do this, or to use rosemary instead of bay. The way we flavoured ours in Italy was with fennel seeds, dried chilli, salt and pepper. I'm going to give you the recipe for 12, but feel free to halve it, or even double it. It's dead simple, and it's made even easier if you ask your butcher to prepare the meat for you. Just ask for a 2kg/4Â½lb loin of pork, off the bone with the skin removed. First of all, smash your fennel seeds up in a pestle and mortar and crumble and bash in your dried chilli - now this is supposed to give a subtle heat, so I'm going to leave it up to you to use as much or as little as you prefer. Put your loin of pork on to a chopping board and score the fat in a criss-cross fashion. Rub the meat all over with a little olive oil, then sprinkle the fennel seeds and chilli all over the pork. Cover the pork up and put it to one side in a roasting tray - if it has come straight out of the fridge let it come to room temperature - so that it can absorb the flavours. About an hour before you're ready to cook, you need to light your barbecue to let it get to the right temperature. I'd advise you to use charcoal instead of gas so that you get a lovely chargrilled flavour coming through. You can also, of course, roast the meat in the oven, but I prefer to do it on the barbecue. (If you roast it in the oven for the whole time it'll need 1 hour 20 minutes.) Either way, season the meat quite generously with salt and pepper and place it fat-side down on the grill. This will make the barbecue flame a bit so you'll probably need to turn it over quickly on to the meat side, but it does tend to get the bars oiled up and the smoke going, which we like. Grill the meat for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on how hot your barbecue is, and remember to keep turning it so it gets those lovely charred bar marks all over it. Remove the pork to the same roasting tray you marinated it in and put it into the oven at 200°C/400°F/gas 6. After half an hour add the vinegar and rosemary leaves, carefully move the meat around and baste it, and put it back into the oven for another 20 minutes. Remove it from the oven, leave it to rest for 10 minutes, then slice the meat up. All the lovely juices from the tray can be kept warm and poured over the meat just before serving. If you've been to Italy, you may have noticed that you really do just get some slices of meat with a simple side dish. At the end of the day, the meat tastes great; so serve it in any way you see fit."

In England, we're sort of brainwashed into thinking of chilli as just being chilli con carne, but this is completely different and I absolutely love it. I think it's cleaner, braver and fresher than your average chilli. You can make your own flatbreads or use tortillas, or you can even serve with chapattis or naans instead. Put a large pan on a high heat and add a little olive oil. Add the pork mince, dried sage and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat up a bit and stir it about, then cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. Add your onions, garlic, peppers and chillies, stir everything together, then fry for 15 minutes on a high heat until any liquid from the pork has evaporated and everything is starting to turn golden. When it looks good, stir in your chopped tomatoes and half a glass of water. Remember that it's supposed to be quite dry (in a really wholesome and nice way), not stewy and wet, so don't add too much water. Turn the heat down to medium and let it tick away for 10 minutes or so while you wash and roughly chop up the lettuce. Pick the leaves from the bunch of mint and roughly chop them. Trim and finely slice your spring onions. When you're ready to serve your chilli, warm your tortillas in the oven at 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for a few minutes or in a dry pan for 30 seconds. Taste your dense chilli. More than likely it will need another good pinch of salt and pepper. If you want to give it a nice fresh edge, you can squeeze in the juice of a lime. Stir in half your chopped mint. Push a warm tortilla or flatbread into each of your little bowls and spoon some delicious green chilli on top of each one. Top with your chopped lettuce and a dollop of yoghurt. Sprinkle over the rest of your mint and spring onions and serve right away with some cold beers."

Get your butcher to butterfly the meat for you then make this beautiful stuffing and roll it up inside the meat before you roast it. You'll want to have a piece of string about an arm's length handy to tie your meat up once you've rolled it. Preheat your oven to full whack. Lay the boned shoulder of pork on a board, skin-side down, and season well with a few really good sprinkles of salt and pepper. Massage this seasoning all over the meat. Put a large pan on a medium heat and fry your diced onion in a lug of olive oil for about 10 minutes and when it's softened but not coloured, turn the heat down to low and add the chopped chicken livers and pork mince. Use a wooden spoon to break the mince up a bit and mix everything together. Add the pine nuts, raisins, chopped sage and parsley, then season with a good sprinkle of salt and pepper. Pour in a splash of red or mulled wine, give everything a good stir then take your pan off the heat. You don't want to cook the meat now, you just want to get a good mix of flavours going so you have a delicious stuffing. Put the stuffing in a bowl and put it to one side to cool down. Once your stuffing has completely cooled, spoon all of it down the middle of the opened shoulder. Roll the meat up quite tightly then tie it up as tightly as you can with 4 or 5 pieces of string. Drizzle all over with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and rub the seasoning all over the skin to help it turn into delicious crackling. Lay your carrots across the middle of the roasting tray and put the meat on top. Pour your glass of red or mulled wine and a glass of water in the bottom of the tray then put your meat in the oven. Turn the heat down immediately to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for about 3 Â½ to 4 hours until lovely and golden. Once it's out of the oven carefully remove the skin and put it to one side.

Get yourself a small sharp knife and make scores about 1cm apart through the skin into the fat, but not so deep that you cut into the meat. If the joint is tied, try not to cut through the string. Rub sea salt right into all the scores you've just made, pulling the skin apart a little if you need to. Brush any excess salt off the surface then turn it over. Season the underside of the meat with a few pinches of salt and black pepper. Place the pork, skin-side up, in a roasting tray and roast for 30 minutes, or until the skin has started to puff up and you can see it turning into crackling. At this point, turn the heat down to 170°C/325°F/gas 3, cover the pork snugly with a double layer of tin foil, pop back in the oven and roast for a further 4Â½ hours. Meanwhile, halve the onions, carrots and celery, and break the garlic up into cloves (there's no need to peel them). Remove the pork from the oven, take off the foil, and baste the meat with the fat in the bottom of the tray. Carefully transfer to a board, then skim all but 2 tablespoons of excess fat from the tray into a jar, and pop in the fridge for tasty cooking another day. Add all the veg, garlic and bay leaves to the tray and stir them into the fat. Place the pork back on top of everything and place back in the oven without the foil to roast for 1 further hour, or until meltingly soft and tender. Carefully move the meat to a serving dish, cover again with tin foil and leave to rest while you make the gravy. Spoon away any fat in the tray, then add the stock (or replace with water, if you prefer) and place the tray on the hob. Bring to the boil and simmer for a few minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to scrape up all those lovely sticky tasty bits from the bottom of the tray. When you've got a nice, dark gravy, pour it through a sieve into jug using your spoon to really push all the goodness of the veg through the sieve. Season to taste, if needed. Serve the pork and crackling with the jug of gravy and all the trimmings - a dollop of apple sauce will finish this off perfectly."

The next day, place the black beans pan on the hob, topping up with water to cover the beans if needed, then bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 30 minutes (it's important to keep them in the same water to achieve the most vibrant colour). Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onions and garlic. Heat a splash of olive oil in a very large casserole pan on a medium-high heat, drain and add the chunks of pig's ear, tail and trotter and pork belly and fry for 15 minutes, or until golden and gnarly. At this point, go in with three-quarters of the chopped onions, and all the garlic, bay leaves and paprika. Slice up the bacon and chorizo 2cm thick, cut the ribs up, then add it all to the pan and cook for 15 minutes, stirring regularly. When the time's up, pour the beans into the meat pan with enough of their cooking water to cover everything nicely. Cook on a low heat for 3 hours, or until the meat is tender, stirring occasionally, and topping up with a little more water, if needed. To make the salsa, peel the onion, deseed the tomatoes and pepper, then very finely chop them with the top leafy half of the parsley, mixing as you go. In a bowl, dress with the lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and vinegar, then taste and season to perfection. Just before you're ready to serve, tear off the leaves of the spring greens, roll up and slice them 1cm thick, then cook with the remaining chopped onions and a splash of olive oil in a large pan on a high heat for 5 minutes. Season the feijoada to taste, then serve with fluffy rice, your spring greens, salsa and plenty of cold beers. To be truly authentic, you want a little bowl of toasted cassava flour on the side to dip each mouthful in, and some hot pickled chillies. Santos also recommends a few fresh wedges of orange to cut through the intensity of the sauce - delicious."

Toss together, then squash flat with a potato masher and roast for a final 20 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Meanwhile, scratch the outside of the cucumber with a fork to create grooves, then finely slice into rounds. Halve and quarter the radishes, peel and very finely slice the onion, then put all this into a bowl with the mustard, vinegar and half the lemon juice.

I've given you the recipe for the pigs in blankets and the batter, and everything else is based on what you've got - just don't overload it. Start by moving your oven shelves around so you have plenty of space in the middle of the oven for your Yorkshire to grow. Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. For the Yorkshire, beat the eggs into the flour with a pinch of sea salt, then gradually whisk in the milk to give you a smooth batter, and pour into a jug. Wrap half a rasher of bacon around each sausage, poking in a sage leaf, too. Pop on to a baking tray with the potatoes (roughly chop, if you like), balls or pinches of stuffing, and the sprouts. Pick over the rosemary leaves and place in the top of the oven for 10 minutes. Pour the sunflower oil into a baking dish (25cm x 30cm) and place in the oven on the shelf underneath, to preheat the oil properly. Meanwhile, for the gravy, wash, trim and finely slice the leek, then put it into a frying pan on a medium heat with the butter or dripping. Cook for 10 minutes, or until soft, stirring occasionally. Shred in the turkey meat and stir in the flour and cranberry sauce, followed by the stock. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thick, then taste and season to perfection. For the next bit, you need to be cool, calm and safe, as you're working with hot oil, and you want to retain the heat from the oven. Have your jug of batter ready and two oven gloves or tea towels. Keep the tray of oil in the oven and carefully pull the shelf out a little.Holding it steady, pour in the batter, then gently transfer everything from the tray above into the centre. Push the shelf back in and keep the door shut for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the Yorkshire is puffed up and golden. Serve the Christmas toad in the hole with the dirty gravy, any extra cranberry sauce, and with a nice fresh slaw on the side."

Use a spatula to push the potato through a sieve into a bowl, then mix with the butter, warmed milk mixture and a little seasoning, until combined and creamy. You can also do this with a potato ricer or French mouli, if you have one. Trim the green beans and cook in a large pan of salted boiling water for 4-5 minutes, or until tender. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the shallot, garlic and tarragon. Dollop the mustard into a serving bowl with 3 tablespoons of vinegar.

Arrange in a flat layer and roast for 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway through. Check the mussels and sort through the clams, giving any that aren't tightly closed a tap. If they don't close, discard them. Peel off the prawn shells, leaving the heads and tails on for bonus flavour, then run a knife down the back to butterfly them and remove the vein. Gently score the mullet and bream along the length of the fillet (going a little deeper if the fillet is fatter, and cutting to fit in the pan if very big). Gently score the scallops on one side. Open up the squids like a book and use a table knife to score the insides in a criss-cross fashion. Separate the halves. Preheat your grill to full whack. Pop all the fish into a large skillet or ovenproof dish, halve the tomatoes and nestle into the gaps. Dot over your reserved flavoured butter, then cut the lemon into wedges and scatter into the pan.

Sprinkle over a little more black pepper and finely grate over the Parmesan, then use a spoon to make little nests in the vegetables for the pieces of chicken to sit in. Place the chicken in these nests and dot little knobs of butter on and around the breasts. Return the tray to the oven to cook for 35 minutes, or until the chicken is golden and cooked through and the potatoes are delicious.

Wash the potatoes and chop into 2cm chunks. Add to the pan and mix well. Keep an eye on the pan, stirring often. Meanwhile, put a clean tea towel over a board and ruffle up the edges to catch the corn. Hold a corn cob upright on the board and run a knife gently down to the base of the kernels, all the way round. Repeat with the rest of the cobs, discarding the cores. Tip the kernels directly from the tea towel into the pan. Add the smoked haddock to the pan with 3 bay leaves and the leaves from 3 sprigs of thyme. Cover with the chicken stock, then put the lid on and cook for 12 minutes. Meanwhile, put the tiger prawns into an ovenproof pan with a few lugs of olive oil, the butter, a pinch of sea salt and pepper, the thyme, cayenne pepper and a small pinch of cinnamon. Crush in 4 unpeeled cloves of garlic, then deseed the chilli, slice and add to the pan with the lemon. Toss and mix well, then put under the grill on the top shelf for 8 to 10 minutes, or until dark pink and golden on the tips. Once ready, take out of the oven and leave to sit until ready to serve. For the salad dressing, peel the garlic and place in a liquidiser with the chilli, tarragon, red wine vinegar, yoghurt, 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and and a pinch of salt and black pepper. Whiz until combined. Have a taste - you want the salt and acid to be slightly over the top, so tweak if needed and whiz again. Pour into a small jug and take to the table. Give the chowder a good stir, then put the lid back on. For the salad, wash and trim the courgette and carrots. Peel the beetroot. Using the coarse grater attachment, grate the vegetables one at a time, all in the food processor. Tip out onto a platter so it looks like a rainbow and snip the cress over the top. Put on the table next to the jug of dressing and dress at the last minute. Add the cream and peeled prawns to the chowder and stir well. Put the lid back on and turn the heat down to low. Put the matzo crackers in a pile on the table. To make the berry slushie, rinse the food processor bowl and fit the standard blade attachment. Add a pint glass or 2 large handfuls of ice cubes, pick in the mint leaves and blitz to a slush. Leave the processor running and add 50ml of elderflower cordial and the raspberries. Pour in 500ml of soda water and leave to whiz until combined. Taste, adding another little splash of elderflower cordial to sweeten if needed. Pour the slushie into a large jug, top up with soda water and stir again right before serving. Take the chowder off the heat. You can leave it coarse and chunky, or use a potato masher to mash it up a little bit and make it silky, or purée the lot - it's up to you. I like to roughly mash one side of it, then mix it through. To serve, take the tiger prawns to the table with the saucepan of chowder. Roughly break a few crackers into each bowl, ladle the chowder on top and finish off with a couple of tiger prawns on the side. Toss the salad in the dressing, taste and season, then tuck in."

Fold the dough in half over the filling, cupping your hands around to seal and get rid of any air bubbles. Make the edge wavy like a shell, placing the dumplings on a floured plate as you go. To cook the dumplings, put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Arrange the first batch of dumplings inside and fry until golden on the bottom. Meanwhile, whisk 4 heaped teaspoons of flour with 800ml of water (re-whisk between batches). Once the dumpling bottoms are golden, pour in enough floury water to come 1cm up the side of the pan. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes, then remove the lid until it begins to fry again - you'll notice a delicate pancake starting to form and encase the dumplings. When it's nicely golden, confidently bang it out upside down on to a serving board. Repeat with the remaining dumplings and floury water. Mix up your own dipping sauce, to taste, using a combination of the condiments. Delicious served as part of a wider dim sum selection."

Spoon two-thirds of your vermicelli filling into a large baking tray or earthenware-type dish, making a bed for the fish, and gently place the fish on top. Stir your prawns into the rest of the vermicelli filling and spoon this into the cavity of your fish, pushing it right in - don't worry if it spills out a little. Drizzle over a little olive oil, and roast in the hot oven for around 25 minutes, until the fish is crisp on the outside and cooked through. To serve, pull the meat off and pick the bones out.

If you want to, you can ask your fishmonger to run a knife down the back of the fish and make a pocket for you to stuff. If not, it's dead easy to do at home. If you need some guidance, check out a video of how to stuff a flatfish. Once you've tried it this way you can stuff the fish with whatever you fancy: lobster or crabmeat, small fish, herbs, tomatoes . . . just let your imagination go wild! Getting a nice big fish isn't hard, but you might want to order it in advance from your fishmonger. It's equally delicious with individual portions though, so look at this as a principle as well as a recipe. Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. If you look at the head and the tail of your fish, more often than not there's a secret line between them that the Big Man upstairs has drawn. Using this as your guide, carefully cut into one side of the line near the head, push down gently, angle the tip-end of your knife towards the bone and score between the flesh and the bone to peel away that beautiful fish fillet. Run the knife down to just above the tail and part the fillet from the bone - about 4 to 5cm deep on both sides. Even if you don't get it perfect, you'll be stuffing this pocket with prawns so no one will know if your knife work was a bit shabby. Get a roasting tray that snugly fits your fish and sprinkle your finely sliced onions around the base of the tray. Season both sides of your fish with sea salt and black pepper and lay it on top of the onions. Try to sweep most of the onions under the fish so they sweeten as they cook. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, the grated garlic and a pinch of cayenne to the olive oil, then grate over the zest of half your lemon. Toss the peeled prawns through this mixture until nicely coated, then stuff them loosely inside the fish, pouring over any flavoured oil left behind in the bowl. Before putting it into the oven drizzle over some olive oil and a splash of white wine, then halve your lemon and add both halves to the tray. Adjust the cooking time depending on the size of your fish: a large fish will want 25 minutes, 2 small fish about 12 minutes. You'll know it's beautifully cooked when the flesh flakes away from the bone. Finely chop your parsley leaves and sprinkle them over the fish once it's out of the oven. Squeeze over the juices from your roasted lemon halves, and serve. I like to put this in the middle of the table with something propping up one end of the tray so that the delicious milky juices run out of the fish and mingle with the olive oil and lemon juices at one end of the tray. Spoon this over clumps of your fish and prawns, and anything else you're serving it with, like new potatoes, mash or simple steamed greens - it will taste wonderful."

Originally, any Louisiana â€˜critter' unlucky enough to get caught would have gone into this: rabbit, duck, squirrel, frog, alligator. . . you name it! And similarly, you can adapt it to whatever your local butcher or fishmonger happens to have. Go cheaper by using things like frozen prawns and chicken livers, or more expensive by including lobster or crab. I used an incredible local smoked sausage called andouille, but fresh chorizo or any other smoked sausage would work just as well. This dish makes me happy every time I eat it. And if more people than expected turn up for dinner just add a bit of extra rice. Season the chicken with sea salt, black pepper and a pinch of cayenne. Pour a couple of lugs of oil into a large casserole type pan and brown the chicken pieces and sliced sausage over a medium heat. After 5 minutes, once nicely browned on all sides, add your onion, peppers and celery as well as your bay, thyme and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir, then fry on a medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes stirring every now and again. It's important to control the heat of the pan: you don't want it to be so slow nothing's happening, or so fast that things are catching and burning. You want a steady, solid heat. Once the veg have softened, add your garlic and chillies, stir around for a minute, then stir in the tinned tomatoes and chicken stock. Bring everything to the boil, then turn the heat down, pop the lid on the pan and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. When you can pull the meat off the bone and shred it easily the chicken's ready. Feel free to remove the chicken bones at this point if you like, then add your rice. Give it all a good stir, then put the lid on. Give it a stir every few minutes, scraping the goodness off the bottom of the pan as you go. Let it cook for about 15 to 20 minutes until the rice is perfectly cooked. Stir in the prawns and if it needs it, add enough water to make it a kind of porridgey consistency (look at the picture). Pop the lid back on and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes while you chop your parsley. Stir the parsley through and serve on a lovely big platter. I absolutely love this with a lemony green salad."

Open them out in a butterfly style and flatten them down gently with the heel of your hand. Season the langoustines and cook them, cut-side down, across the bars (so they don't fall through) on a hot barbie for 2 minutes and then for 30 seconds on their backs before lifting them on to a serving plate.

Chop 250g of unsalted butter into cubes, then, using your fingertips, gently work it into the flour and sugar until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs (or simply pulse in a food processor). Beat 2 large eggs with 4 tablespoons of whole milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla bean paste, then add to the flour mixture and gently work it together until it forms a ball of dough. Divide the dough in half, cover each piece and pop into the fridge to rest for 30 minutes. Roll one of the pieces of pastry out into a round, about Â½cm thick. Lightly grease a 24cm non-stick loose-bottomed tart tin with vegetable oil. Line the base and sides with the pastry. Prick the bottom with a fork, then place back in the fridge until needed. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Meanwhile, make the filling. Trim 1kg of rhubarb and peel and core 500g of eating apples, then chop into 3cm chunks and place into a large pan with 125g of golden caster sugar, and a splash of water. Simmer on a medium heat for 15 minutes, or until tender, then strain through a colander, catching the liquid in a bowl. Tip the strained liquid back into the pan and simmer over a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until thick and syrupy. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Scrunch up a large piece of greaseproof paper, then unwrap it and use it to line your pastry case, pushing it right into the sides. Fill the case with rice or baking beans, and bake blind for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the rice or baking beads (save for another bake) and return to the oven for a further 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Pour 500ml of whole milk into a pan over a medium-low heat, whisk in 3 level tablespoons of custard powder, the remaining 35g of golden caster sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla bean paste. Whisk in a figure of 8 until the mixture becomes really thick, then pour into the pastry case and leave to cool. For your pie lid, roll the remaining pastry out into a circle, just under 1cm thick (it will be larger than you need, but the excess can be used for decorating). Carefully spoon the apples and rhubarb over the custard base. Beat the remaining egg, then use it to eggwash the edges of the pie. Top with the pie lid, gently tuck in slightly, then roll over the top with your rolling pin to trim away the excess pastry. Use the excess pastry to decorate the top of your pie, however you like. Brush with a little more beaten egg to glaze, then toss 50g of flaked almonds in 1 teaspoon of icing sugar and a tiny splash of water, then sprinkle over the top. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden. Delicious served with more custard and the beautiful fruit syrup drizzled over."

Grease two 20cm springform cake tins and line the bases with greaseproof paper, then dust the sides with flour. Chop the butter into cubes, then beat with the caster sugar and vanilla until very pale and creamy. Beat in the eggs one by one, then sift in and fold through the flour and baking powder. Divide the batter between the prepared tins and spread out evenly. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden and an skewer inserted comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in the tins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, to make the jam, trim the rhubarb, chop into 3cm chunks and place in a large pan with the caster sugar and 2 tablespoons of water. Mix well. Place the pan over a medium heat with the lid ajar. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and simmer for a further 10 minutes, or until the rhubarb has broken down and is thick and jammy, stirring occasionally. Leave to cool. To make the custard, mix the custard powder, icing sugar and 1 splash of milk together in a pan. Whisk to a smooth paste, then pour in the remaining milk and whisk again until well combined. Place over a low heat and cook gently for 10 minutes, or until thick and silky smooth, whisking continuously. Take the custard pan off the heat and cover with a layer of non-PVC clingfilm, making sure it's in contact with the custard - this will prevent a skin forming on the surface. To make the buttercream, chop the butter into cubes, place in the bowl of a stand mixer, and whisk for 2 minutes, or until creamy (or beat it by hand). Sift the icing sugar into a bowl, then gradually add it to the mixer, a few spoonfuls at a time. When all the sugar has been added, whisk for a further 4 to 5 minutes, or until very pale and fluffy - it should resemble whipped cream. Add 1 small splash of water to the buttercream and fold through to loosen slightly, if needed. Spoon the buttercream into a piping bag with a 1.5cm plain round nozzle, or use a large sandwich bag (then snip off the corner). Whisk the cooled custard to loosen, then scrape into another piping bag with a 1.5cm plain round nozzle, or use a sandwich bag. Slice the cooled cakes in half horizontally, using a serrated knife, reserving the prettiest cake half for the top. Place one cake half cut-side up, and spread over one third of the jam. Pipe small alternating blobs of custard and buttercream around the outside of the cake. Repeat, until the whole of the cake is covered. Do the same with the next two cake layers.

Add the zest and juice of both oranges, then cover with foil and roast in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until softened - the cooking time may vary, depending on the thickness of your rhubarb. Taste it and add a little more sugar if you like. Transfer the rhubarb to a plate, set aside, and pour the roasting juices into a pan. Boil it for a few minutes until it forms a thick syrup, then set this aside too. To make the custard, pour the milk, cream and 4 tablespoons of the sugar into a pan. Split the vanilla pod in half and scrape out the seeds, adding both to the pan. Bring it to the boil over medium heat, stirring continuously, then remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly. Place the egg yolks in a large bowl and beat in the remaining sugar to combine. Remove the vanilla pod from the milk, then slowly whisk the warm milk mixture into the yolks. Return the custard to the pan and place over a low heat for a few minutes, stirring continuously, until it coats the back of a spoon. Sieve it into a clean bowl, cover the surface with a layer of clingfilm to stop it forming a skin, and set aside. Make the meringues by placing the egg whites in a clean bowl and beating them with an electric whisk until they form firm peaks. Continue whisking as you add the sugar, then turn up the mixer and whisk for about 7 minutes, or until they're white and glossy. To poach the meringues, pour the milk into a wide, shallow saucepan over a medium heat and warm it through until it just begins to simmer. Float 3 or 4 heaped tablespoons of the meringue mixture on the hot milk, making sure they are well spaced out to allow them to expand. Cook for about 30 seconds, then turn over and cook for 30 seconds more, or until they're firm. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meringues to a plate lined with kitchen paper, to absorb any milk. Repeat with the remaining meringue mixture, discarding the milk once you've finished. Spoon the custard into serving bowls, top with the roasted rhubarb - stirring a little for a rippled effect, if you like - then finish by placing a meringue island on top.

Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Trim and finely chop the celery. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the knob of butter into a separate pan, add the onion, garlic and celery, and cook very slowly for about 15 minutes without colouring. This is called a soffrito. When the vegetables have softened, add the rice and turn up the heat. The rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep stirring it. After a minute it will look slightly translucent. Add the vermouth or wine and keep stirring - it will smell fantastic. Any harsh alcohol flavours will evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty essence. Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of sea salt. Turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn't cook too quickly on the outside. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the creamy starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take around 15 minutes. Taste the rice to check if it's cooked. If not, carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. Don't forget to check the seasoning carefully. If you run out of stock before the rice is cooked, add some boiling water. Remove from the heat and add the 70g butter and grate in the Parmesan. Stir well. Place a lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 minutes. This is the most important part of making the perfect risotto, as this is when it becomes amazingly creamy and oozy like it should be.

This should take about 15 minutes and give you rice that is beginning to soften but is still al dente. Meanwhile, pop the goat's cheese onto a roasting tray, sprinkle over the fennel seeds and red chilli, and place in the oven for 10 minutes. Next, heat a deep saucepan on a medium heat, then add 1 tablespoon of butter, a splash of olive oil, the garlic and a good grating of nutmeg. Once the butter has melted, add the sorrel and cook for about 2 minutes, moving it around until it's just wilted down. Take the pan off the heat, let the sorrel cool slightly, then chop it finely and season to taste. Take the pan of rice off the heat, add the chopped sorrel and beat in the remaining butter and grated Parmesan. Add a good squeeze of lemon juice, then check the seasoning and add a little salt and pepper if needed. Pop a lid on the pan and leave the risotto to rest for a minute, while you remove the goat's cheese from the oven. Dish up your risotto, grate a little lemon zest over the top, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, and top with another grating of Parmesan. Serve with the lovely roasted goat's cheese on the side for everyone to crumble over the top."

The use of vodka instead of wine leaves you with a fragrant freshness when the risotto is cooked, which marries fantastically well with smoky flakes of haddock and the al dente crunch of fine yellow beans. As there is fish in this risotto you don't want to include any Parmesan, so bear this in mind. If you're a risotto fan you've got to give this a try.
Start your basic risotto, adding the vodka at Stage 2 instead of the wine. Then lightly poach your haddock in the milk and stock from the basic recipe with a couple of bay leaves, covered with a lid. Simmer for around 5 minutes and remove from the heat. At Stage 3 of the basic recipe, I like to add the poaching liquor to the rice and then I carry on as normal through the recipe. At the end of Stage 3 flake in your smoked haddock, add the beans and carry on as normal through to the end of the recipe. Don't serve with any Parmesan sprinkled over - serve sprinkled with the celery leaves. Add a dash of vodka and a squeeze of lemon to lift the flavours. Lovely."

You don't want to cook them to pulp - they should be soft but should still hold their shape. Remove from the heat and put to one side. In an appropriately sized high-sided, thick-bottomed pan with a lid, slowly melt two-thirds of the butter. Score down the length of the vanilla pods and remove the seeds by scraping a knife down the inside of each half. Add the seeds to the butter and stir. Continue to cook for 1 minute before adding your rice with the remaining sugar. Turn the heat up to medium, stir the rice, and add the wine, continuing to stir until it has almost cooked away. Now add the milk little by little. Keep the rice on a slow but constant simmer for about 16 or 17 minutes and stir it as often as you can. In this way you can massage the starch out of the rice and this will give you a silky, oozy end product, much like the classic Italian risotto. When the rice has cooked through it should be soft yet still holding its shape. You may need to add a little more milk or water just to adjust the consistency. Remove from the heat, add the grated white chocolate and the rest of the butter, then stir, place a lid on top and leave for a few minutes. Remove the skin and stones from the peaches, discard them along with the cinnamon stick, and take the peaches to the table with your block of dark chocolate, snapped into small pieces. Spoon the risotto on to plates, then push a couple of pieces of dark chocolate into the middle of each one. Just so you know, a perfect risotto should slowly creep and ooze to the side of your plate, so don't worry if it starts to spread out! Gently tear the peaches and place some on each plate, then drizzle over some of the lovely juice and sprinkle over a few mint leaves. By the time you go to eat it, the dark chocolate will have melted. Joy joy joy!"

Have a go at mastering it - you'll be amazed at the light and fluffy results. Once you've got the hang of that, you can have a go at flavouring it - any flavouring you boil with the rice will infuse it with wonderful fragrances and flavours. So try boiling things like fresh herbs, a cinnamon stick, a few cardamom pods, a strip of lemon zest or even a green tea bag in the water with the rice. Doubling the amounts in the recipe will give you enough rice to serve 8-12 people. Put a large pan of salted water on a high heat and bring to the boil. Rinse the rice in a colander under running water for about 1 minute, or until the water runs clear (this will stop the grains sticking together later). Add your rice to the boiling water and wait for the grains to start dancing around. From that point, boil for 5 minutes, Drain the rice in a colander. Pour 2.5cm of water into the pan, put it back on the heat and bring it to the boil again, then turn down to a simmer. Cover the rice in the colander with foil or a lid. Place the colander on top of the pan of simmering water and let the rice steam over it for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and if you're ready, serve immediately.

If your barbie is small, feel free to cut the salmon in half to make it more manageable. Place the salmon skin side down on a plastic board and, using a sharp knife, slash it evenly all over on the fleshy side, making the incisions about 1cm deep. Grate the lemon zest and most of the chopped fennel tops or basil over the salmon, then push these flavourings into the incisions - don't hold back; really push them in!, Rub the fish lightly all over with olive oil then season with salt and pepper, giving the skin side a generous amount as most of this will fall off. When your barbie's ready, lay the salmon on the bars, skin side down. The flesh will start to colour from the bottom up and after about 4 minutes the skin should be beautifully golden brown. Carefully flip the salmon over with a roasting fork or a spatula and cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes on the other side. While it's cooking, gently ease the skin away from the fish and put it on the barbie alongside to crisp up.

If your salmon is wild it will have slightly less fat in it, so will be a drier fish. You can therefore cook it for a shorter amount of time, even leaving it slightly undercooked - although this might feel unusual to us Brits, who nuke fish beyond belief, this is a really good idea!, If it's (organically) farmed, cook it through, but please don't overcook it or it will become too dry. Lift the salmon carefully off the barbecue and place it on a nice serving platter or board. Allow to cool a little, then break the skin into pieces, a bit like poppadoms. Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, remove and discard the seeds, chop it up and mix it in a bowl with the yoghurt. Balance the flavours with the lemon juice, half the chopped chilli, and half the chopped mint or oregano. Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil. Season carefully to taste with salt and pepper. Break the salmon up with a fork into four to six chunks. Serve with the cucumber yoghurt, sprinkled with the rest of the chopped chilli and the remaining fennel tops or basil. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and make sure everyone gets a piece of the crunchy fish skin."

When the sage is brown, add the onions and cook for 15 minutes, until golden and sweet. Don't rush this part, this is where you amplify the flavour. Now let's ramp up the Christmassy flavours: tip in the cranberries, and crumble in the chestnuts. Thinly slice the dried apples and add to the pan with a big pinch of salt and black pepper. Finely grate in the zest of both the clementines (save one for step 8 and the other for your turkey trivet) and pour in the cider. Let the cider bubble away until lovely and shiny, then leave to cool completely. Tear the stale bread into small chunks, place in a food processor and blitz into breadcrumbs (you might need to do this in batches). Tip into a baking tray or dish and add the onion mixture. Use clean hands to really scrunch and mix everything together. Take half of the stuffing and press it into an oiled bundt tin or baking dish. Add the sausagemeat to the remaining stuffing and use your hands to scrunch everything together. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, then scrunch it all up until well combined. Take a third of the stuffing and place it in a pretty baking dish. Cut one of the zested clementines in half and push, skin-side down into the centre of the stuffing. (Use the remaining stuffing to stuff your turkey). Pop both dishes in the oven to cook for 50 minutes, or until bubbling and crispy. If you're doing it as part of your Christmas lunch, you want to put it in at the same time as your spuds. Once done, you can pour away any excess fat before serving, if you like.

Line 2 large baking trays with baking paper. Place a small bowl upside down in the centre of one of the trays and arrange the larger sausage rolls around it, leaving space in between each one. Then use the smaller sausage rolls to fill the gaps (as per the picture above). Remove the bowl and place the squash rolls in the centre. Any remaining rolls can be frozen for another time (see tip). Brush all the pastry with the remaining egg wash and sprinkle with the sesame and poppy seeds. Rub the rosemary sprigs and bay leaves with Â½ a tablespoon of olive oil, then stick into the pastry around the wreath. To make the plait, cut the remaining pastry in half lengthways. Place the tip of the knife near the top of the pastry and cut each half into three lengthways, making sure it remains connected at the top. Grate over the rest of the Cheddar (50g) and then weave into two plaits. Pinch the ends together to join them up into one long plait and form into a circle, patting any cheese that falls off back onto the pastry. Place on the lined baking tray, then transfer both trays to the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes until golden, crisp and bubbling. Lay the plait above the wreath and decorate with ribbon or baubles, if you like, before serving."

Season with a little salt and pepper and a sprinkling of lemon zest. Sear for a minute in a frying pan, scored-side down, with a touch of olive oil, and don't be tempted to touch them! Add the roe to the pan now, too. After a minute, check the underside, and continue to fry until lovely and caramelised. Turn them over and allow the other side to do the same. Be careful not to overcook them though, a minute or so on each side is all they need. Arrange the salad leaves on a large platter, then nestle the lovely scallops in among them.

At this point, take the tin out of the oven, being very careful, and pour the batter over the sausages. Throw a couple of sprigs of rosemary into the batter. It will bubble and possibly even spit a little, so carefully put the tin back in the oven, and close the door. Don't open it for at least 20 minutes, as Yorkshire puddings can be a bit temperamental when rising. Remove from the oven when golden and crisp. For the onion gravy, peel and finely slice the onions and garlic, then simply fry off in the butter on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until they go sweet and translucent. You could add a little thyme or rosemary here, if you like. Add the balsamic vinegar and allow it to cook down by half. At this point, I do cheat a little and add a stock cube or powder.

Stir in your garlic, chilli, thyme and spices and fry for another minute or two. Stir in your flour and vinegar, and after a couple of minutes add your browned sausages, chicken stock and tinned tomatoes, using a wooden spoon to break them up a little.

Always buy the freshest scallops you can find and pat them dry before cooking them. Give the butter a whiz in a food processor with the mint leaves, a pinch or two of salt and pepper and the zest of the lemon. Lay a sheet of greaseproof paper (roughly A4 size) on your kitchen surface and dollop all of the flavoured butter in the middle of it. Roll the butter into a sausage shape and cut a good-sized amount off the end to use later. Twist the ends of the paper so it looks like a Christmas cracker. Then pop it in the fridge to use up that week or put it in the freezer and take slices off as and when you need it. Place a griddle pan on a high heat and get a saucepan of salted water boiling at the same time. Once the griddle is hot, toss your scallops in a little olive oil and season them with salt and pepper. If there is roe on your scallops (orange stuff, also known as coral), prick it with a knife before putting the scallops in the pan, or it will burst. Grill the scallops on each side for a minute or so until they're cooked through and golden on each side. When you've turned the scallops once, add your pancetta or bacon to the griddle and cook until crisp and golden brown. Just before everything is ready to come out of the pan, put your pancetta or bacon on top of the scallops so the fat drips down and flavours them. While that's going, snap the woody ends off the asparagus stalks and throw them away, keeping the delicate tips. Drop these tips in the boiling water and cook for a minute before adding the frozen peas. Cook for a minute more, drain well and put in a bowl to flavour. Toss the cooked veg in some olive oil, a good squeeze of lemon, salt and pepper and a knob (roughly 20g) of the minty butter (save the rest for another day). Put a plate on top of the bowl to keep the vegetables warm. Pile your wonderfully-flavoured vegetables onto two warmed plates and top with the pancetta or bacon, scallops and some rocket leaves.

You'll get small, dainty portions, but each bite will be a real wake-up for the senses. Tartare is seen as a really cheffy thing to make, because most people, unless they're quite foodie, won't eat raw meat or fish at home.

Ideally, oysters should be straight out of the sea when you eat them. Give them a rinse in cold water before you start preparing them - this can be tricky so please be very careful!, To open them, you'll need an oyster knife which is short, thick and quite blunt. Do not use a normal kitchen knife - it's dangerous and you'll probably snap the tip of the knife off! A screwdriver is probably a better bet if you don't have an oyster knife. Hold the oyster curved-side down on a chopping board with a folded kitchen cloth between the shell and your hand - this is to help you get a good grip and protect your hand. Look for the hinge between the top shell and the bottom shell, and poke the knife tip into the crack. You need to push quite hard and work it in there but eventually you should be able to prise the top shell off. It's not always that easy so it might be a good idea to try a few before dinner to get the hang of it. Wear an apron too in case you get a bit dirty. When you get the oyster open, throw away the top shell. If there is any seawater in the bottom shell with the oyster, try and keep it in there. Pick out any fragments of shell and place the oyster on a plate with a mound of rock salt or crushed ice in the middle.

It's great for battering fish, shellfish and vegetables. In Japan there are lots of tempura restaurants where everyone sits behind a bar and you get given the most amazing tempura for over two hours by a chef and his â€˜master', who does a lot of shouting. To kill the lobsters take a sharp knife, place it at the crown of the head, and cut straight down - this will kill them straight away. Twist off the tail and both claws. Cut the tail in half lengthways and each tail half into 3. Chop the claws into 3, slice up the remaining body meat, and place, with the tail pieces, in a bowl with any juice that comes out. Mix the dipping sauce ingredients together in a bowl and set aside. I suggest you use a deep-fat fryer as it's easier to control. Heat it to 170°C/325°F. You can use a wok half-filled with oil, safely positioned on a stove with a thermometer, but be aware of other people (curious kids) and of possibly knocking things over if doing it this way. To make the batter, whisk the egg yolks and iced water together, add the cornflour and flour, and stir together using chopsticks - this helps to keep the batter a bit lumpy, which is what you want. Add the okra, chillies and lobster to the batter. Feel free to add any other veggies you fancy. Fine slices of sweet potato, whole spring onions, coriander stalks and baby courgettes with their flowers are all good. Once battered, pick up the lobster and veg and carefully put them into the oil. Don't try to cook the tempura all at once - do them in 2 batches. Cook them until light golden and crisp on both sides. Drain them on some kitchen paper and then put them on to a plate. Serve the tempura with the dipping sauce and a dish of flavoured salt - I would suggest either jasmine tea salt or citrus salt. Try this: I once worked in a Japanese restaurant and when the chefs put the veg into the oil, they dripped extra batter from a height on to them. This gave the tempura a really crunchy, spiky look and feel. You don't have to do this but it's a good little trick."

Lightly brush with oil and a pinch of sesame seeds. Continue until you have used six sheets. Lay the spinach mix over the pastry. Place another sheet of filo on top, folding it in two. Lightly brush with oil and sesame seeds. Gently fold over the edges of the bottom layers of pastry. Add 2 more sheets of filo, again brushing with oil and sprinkling sesame seeds in between. Finish with a light brush of oil and sesame seeds, and gently score the top into 8 squares, using a sharp knife. Bake for 50 minutes, or until golden brown.

Trim and finely slice the spring onions and chillies (deseeding if you like), then pick and finely chop the herb leaves. Stir it all into the batter, along with the cumin seeds and turmeric until well combined. Leave the batter to rest for at least 15 minutes. Lightly grease the frying pan with oil and place over a medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add a ladleful of batter, turning the pan so it evenly and thinly coats the base.

Meanwhile, scrub the sweet potatoes and slice into 2cm chunks (there's no need to peel them), then char in the hot, dry frying pan for 5 minutes, turning them halfway through. Meanwhile, peel the onions and cut into 1cm chunks, then dry-fry in the casserole dish for 3 minutes until softened. Push them to the side and drizzle in 2 tablespoons of oil, then stir in the cumin seeds, paprika, cocoa powder and peanut butter. Add 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar and scrape up any sticky bits from the bottom of the pan, then stir in the charred sweet potato. Prick the chillies and blacken all over in the hot frying pan or directly over the gas flame. Carefully place the charred peppers on a board, then deseed and roughly chop, adding them to the casserole dish as you go. Carefully remove the charred chillies to a board, then finely chop and add to the mix. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Strain the butter beans in a sieve over the casserole dish, so the juices go straight in, then tip the beans into a the hot, dry frying pan and leave them in an even layer, without stirring, until they start to char and pop, then tip into the veg. Tip in the chickpeas (juice and all) and scrunch in the tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, then pour in 1 tin's worth of water. Finely chop and add the coriander stalks (saving the leaves for later), season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and stir well, then pop on the lid, leaving a little opening, and cook for 1 hour, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, scrub the potatoes and dry with a clean tea towel. Prick them all over with a fork and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt, then place on a baking tray and bake for 1 hour, or until crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. For the salsa, peel the onion and thinly slice with the apple, then tip into a small bowl, dress with the lime juice and season to perfection. For the cheat's chilli sauce, blitz the jalapeÃ±os and their vinegar with the mint in a food processor until smooth. When you're ready to serve, finely chop the coriander leaves and stir through the chilli with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Grate the cheese and click off the lettuce leaves. To serve, cut a cross into each baked spud, pinching the bottoms so they open up, and transfer to serving plates. Top with the cheese, stuffing it in well, then add a good spoonful of the chilli and serve with the lettuce leaves, a dollop of yoghurt, a sprinkling of the salsa and a drizzle of the chilli sauce. Put a large casserole pan on a medium-low heat and a grill pan beside it on a high heat. The idea here is to work in batches, starting by charring the veg on the grill to add a smoky flavor dimension. Peel the onions and cut into Â½-inch dice, char on the grill for 3 minutes, then place in the casserole pan with 2 tablespoons of oil, the cumin seeds, paprika, cocoa, and peanut butter, stirring occasionally. Slice the chile(s) Â½ inch thick and grill while you seed and roughly chop the peppers and chop the sweet potatoes into rough Â¾-inch chunks (leave the skin on for extra nutritional benefit, just give them a wash). Grill it all, adding to the casserole pan as you go. Finely chop and add the cilantro stalks. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Drain the beans in a sieve over the casserole pan so the juices go in, then tip the beans into the grill pan in an even layer. Have faith and leave them without stirring until they start to char and burst, then add to the veg. Pour in the canned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Stir well, then pop the lid on ajar and leave for 1 hour, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, wash the potatoes, prick, then bake for 1 hour, or until crispy on the outside, fluffy in the middle. Just before serving, finely chop the cilantro leaves and stir through the chili, taste, and season to perfection. Cut a cross into each spud, pinching the bottoms so they open up, then grate the cheese and divide it between them, stuffing it in well.

Sprinkle over the capers and the rocket and drizzle over the remaining dressing. Finish with a sprinkling of cayenne and a good grating of lemon zest, then tuck in."

Peel the onion, wash the leek and trim with the celery, then finely chop it all. Return the pan of fat to a medium heat, then add the veg and fry for 10 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, stirring occasionally, and adding a splash of oil, if needed. Pour the stock into a separate pan and bring to a simmer on a low heat. Stir the rice into the veg for a couple of minutes, then pour in the Prosecco. Let it cook away, then start adding the stock, a ladleful at a time, letting each one cook away before adding more.

When the risotto is done, add enough extra stock to make it oozy, then remove from the heat. Finely grate over most of the Parmesan and beat it in with the butter and mascarpone, then taste and season to perfection. Put the lid on and take to the table.

Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. You want to cook a higher-welfare bird for 25 to 30 minutes per kilo, and a standard bird for 35 to 40 minutes per kilo. Higher-welfare birds generally have more intramuscular fat, which means they cook quicker than standard, lean birds. If you've got a 7kg bird, like I had here, do it for just over 3 hours, based on the guideline timings above. Just under 1 hour before the time is up, get the tray out of the oven and remove the tin foil. Cover the bird with your rashers of bacon, stretching and weaving them into a criss-cross pattern however you like. Return the turkey to the oven for the remaining time, or until golden and cooked through. The simplest way to check it's cooked is to stick a knife into the thickest part of the thigh - if the juices run clear, it's done. If you're worried, use a meat thermometer. You want to reach an internal temperature of 65°C for a top-quality bird, such as Paul Kelly's turkeys, or 70°C for a supermarket higher-welfare or standard bird. Use heavy-duty tongs to lift up your bird so all the juices run from the cavity into the tray, then transfer the turkey to a platter, cover with a double layer of tin foil and a clean tea towel, and leave to rest for up to 2 hours while you crack on. Use your tray of trivet veg and juices to make your gravy. Place the turkey tray over a medium heat on the hob. Skim away most of the fat from the surface into a jar, cool, and place in the fridge for tasty cooking another day. Stir the flour into the tray, mashing up all the veg and scraping up all the sticky bits from the base. Pour in up to 2 litres of boiling kettle water and simmer until the gravy is the consistency of your liking, then stir in the cranberry sauce. Strain the gravy through a coarse sieve, pushing all the goodness through with the back of a spoon, then season to perfection. Keep warm over the lowest heat until needed, adding any extra resting juices from the turkey before serving."

Halve the clementine and chilli and place in the turkey cavity with most of the herbs - not filling it too full allows hot air to circulate, cooking the bird from the inside out and from the outside in. Place the stuffing in the neck cavity (click here for my meat stuffing recipe, or you could use any veggie stuffing), then pull the skin back over it and tuck it under the bird. You'll get a good contrast between the soft, juicy stuffing here inside the turkey, and the crispier stuff you can bake in a dish, as well. Scrunch and warm the butter in your hands so it's soft enough to spread all over the bird, getting into all the nooks and crannies. The butter layer serves two purposes - natural basting, plus keeping the seasoning away from the meat until it hits the oven, so the bird stays nice and juicy. The butter will melt off as it cooks, adding to the flavour of the gravy, and you'll also be able to skim off that tasty fat and save it in a jar in the fridge for delicious cooking another day. Generously sprinkle the turkey from all sides with sea salt and black pepper, pick over the remaining herb leaves and pat them on to the butter, then finely grate over a nice coating of nutmeg. Cover the turkey snugly with tin foil and place it on top of the trivet in the tray.

Stir in the cooled leeks and bacon until just combined, but don't overwork it - we want the dough as light as possible. Gently roll it out on a clean flour-dusted surface until 2cm thick, then use a 5cm fluted cutter to stamp out as many round dumplings as you can, re-rolling and using up any offcuts - you should get at least 12 from this amount. Brush the dumplings with beaten egg, then sit them on top of the stew. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the dumplings are risen and golden and the stew is blipping and bubbling away nicely.

Either way, get your turkey out of the fridge 1 to 2 hours in advance, depending on its size, so it can come up to room temperature. Check the main cavity for the bag of giblets, and if they're in there, remove them and tip into your roasting tray. The added flavour for your gravy later will be incredible - trust me. Warm the butter in your clean hands then rub and massage it all over the bird, getting into all the nooks and crannies, then sprinkle from a height with sea salt and black pepper. Halve the clementine and place in the main cavity with the fresh herbs - you don't want to pack it full as you want to allow hot air to circulate. Use a handful (200g) of your favourite stuffing to fill the neck cavity, but don't stuff it in too tightly, then pull the skin back over it and tuck it under the bird. You'll get a good contrast between the soft, juicy stuffing here and the crispier stuff you can bake off in a dish. Roughly chop the veg - there's no need to peel them - and chuck into the tray with the giblets to make your trivet, then sit the turkey on top and cover the tray with tin foil. Remember now to wash your hands, plus any kitchen kit the raw turkey has touched, before moving on. COOK - Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. As a guide, you want to cook a higher-welfare bird for 25 to 30 minutes per kilo, and a standard bird for 35 to 40 minutes per kilo. If you've got a 6kg bird, like I had here, do it for 2 hours 42 minutes - this sounds very precise, but I find that 27 minutes per kilo for a higher-welfare bird is the sweet spot. Remove the tin foil about 45 minutes before the end of cooking, to allow the turkey to get nice and golden. To check it's cooked, the simplest way is to stick a knife into the thickest part of the thigh - if the juices run clear, it's done. If you're worried, you could also use a meat thermometer. You want to reach an internal temperature of 65°C for a top-quality bird, such as Paul Kelly's turkeys, or 70°C for a supermarket higher-welfare or standard bird. Use heavy-duty tongs to lift up your bird so all the juices run from the cavity into the tray, then transfer the turkey to a platter, cover it with a double layer of tin foil and a clean tea towel, and leave to rest for up to 2 hours while you crack on with everything else. See how to finish your gravy by checking out my Christmas Day gravy recipe. CARVE - Choose from the two methods below, or watch the How to carve a turkey video on Food Tube. Remove the wing, slice the skin beside the leg, then pull out and chop the legs off. You can either slice or pull this brown meat - it's so tasty. Keep it warm while you move on to the breast meat. Use the full length of the knife in a nice smooth action to slice through the breast meat, transferring it to a platter as you go. Remove the leg as above, then feel where the backbone is and cut with the length of your knife all the way down beside it until you hit the carcass. You can then lift the whole breast off the bone.

If you don't have a large enough container, transfer the turkey to aÂ large plastic bag and pour the marinade over it. Refrigerate to marinate overnight.

For the rum butter, put all ingredients in a food processor and blitz until combined. Chill until ready to use. Preheat the oven to its highest temperature. Remove the turkey from the fridge and place on a large board (reserve the marinade for basting). Carefully pack as much of the stuffing into the neck cavity as you can fit. Take some small metal skewers and pierce the skin on either side to close the cavity and keep the stuffing in. Put the remaining stuffing in a lightly greased baking dish and set aside in the fridge. Halve the carrots lengthways, peel and slice the clementines, and halve the orange. Peel and cut the onions into wedges, and roughly chop the celery. Put the carrot, fruit, onion and celery in a large roasting tin then place the turkey on top. Rub the rum butter all over the turkey, season well, then brush with some marinade and place in the oven. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes at the highest heat then reduce the heat to 180°C/gas 4, cover the turkey with foil and roast for 35 to 40Â minutes per kilo, basting with the marinade every 30 minutes. Remove the foil during the last hour of cooking so the skin gets crisp, and baste more frequently. YouÂ can use a meat thermometer to check if it's cooked - insert into the thickest part of the breast; the turkey is ready when it registers 72°C. Add the tray of stuffing to the oven for the last 15 minutes of cooking time, and bake while the turkey rests (45Â minutes in total). Transfer the turkey to a board (reserve the pan juices), and brush off some of the blackened marinade to reveal the bronzed skin. Cover with 2Â layers of foil and 2Â tea towels and rest for at least 30 minutes. Chop the kale and boil in salted water for 5 minutes, till tender. Drain, reserving some of the water.

Heat a lug of oil in a large pan on a medium heat, then add the onion. Cook for around 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly. Add the allspice, dried fruit, nuts, thyme and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, then transfer to a large bowl and leave to cool completely. Once cool, add the pork mince and breadcrumbs to the bowl and scrunch everything together with clean hands. Reserve about half the stuffing for the turkey, then transfer the rest to a greased baking dish (approximately 20cm). Spread it out in an even layer, keeping it rough on top, then put aside. Preheat the oven to full whack. Rinse the turkey under the cold tap, then
pat it dry, inside and out, with kitchen paper. Peel and crush the garlic, finely grate the lemon zest, then pick and roughly chop the thyme and rosemary. In a small bowl, mix the soft butter, garlic, lemon zest, half the thyme and rosemary leaves and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Push your finger and thumb between the skin and the flesh around the main cavity to make a gap and use a spatula to push in the butter. Squash the skin back down and use your hands to smooth and spread the butter under the skin. Open up the neck cavity and pack in the reserved stuffing. Pull the skin over the cavity and tuck it under the bird. Drizzle the bird with oil and season with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then rub this into the meat. Cut the zested lemon in half and place in the empty cavity. Peel and roughly chop the onion, trim and roughly chop the celery and carrot, then place in a large roasting tray with the turkey on top. Cover with tin foil then place in the hot oven. Immediately reduce the temperature to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Cook for about 35 to 40 minutes per kilo - the 5kg bird in this recipe will take about 3 to 3Â½ hours. Check your turkey every 30 minutes or so - spoon over any juices from the
bottom of the tray to keep it juicy. After 2Â½ hours, remove the foil so the skin crisps up. Thirty minutes before the turkey is ready, mix the remaining herbs with oil and scatter over the bird. Halve and add the clementines to the tray and leave in for the remaining cooking time. To check the turkey is cooked, stick a small sharp knife into the fattest part
of the thigh. If the juices run clear and the meat pulls apart easily, it's ready. If not, cook it for a bit longer then check again. Once done, transfer the turkey to a serving platter and turn the oven up to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Cover the turkey with tin foil and 2 clean tea towels to keep it warm. Leave to rest for about 30 minutes while you cook your veg, stuffing and gravy. For the roast potatoes and veg, peel the parsnips, scrub the potatoes and carrots, then peel and halve the shallots. Break the garlic bulb up into cloves. Parboil the baby carrots in a pan of boiling salted water on a high heat for 5 minutes. Drain them in a colander and leave to steam dry. Chop the potatoes into 2cm chunks and peel and halve the parsnips lengthways. Add the veg to 2 large roasting trays with the shallots. Crush the garlic cloves with the heel of your hand and pick the rosemary leaves. Add both
to the trays along with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Drizzle everything generously with oil and toss well to coat. Roast in the hot oven along with the stuffing for 30 to 40 minutes, or until cooked through. When the veg and stuffing are in the oven, warm the stock in a pan on a
medium heat. Skim most of the fat away from the roasting tray, then stir in the flour, using a wooden spoon to scrape up all the sticky bits from the bottom. Place on a medium heat and add the red wine. Once that has cooked away, pour in the stock, bring it all to the boil, then reduce to a medium heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until you get a good consistency.

If you're buying from a small producer, like the lovely turkey I used from my mate Paul Kelly, you'll often find these birds come with their own cooking instructions. Really good-quality birds do cook in a shorter time so follow the instructions if it has them. This year I'm using a flavoured butter to give a bit of extra love to my turkey, and this is a job you can do the day before. Get your turkey and use a spoon to work your way between the skin and the meat. Start at the side of the cavity just above the leg and work gently up towards the breastbone and towards the back so you create a large cavity. Pick up half of your butter and push it into the cavity you've created. Use your hands to push it through the skin right to the back so it coats the breast meat as evenly as possible. Do the same on the other side then rub any leftover butter all over the outside of the bird to use it up. If you've got any herb stalks left over, put them in the cavity of the turkey for added flavour as it cooks. Cover the turkey in cling film and keep in the fridge until you need it. Take your turkey out of the fridge a few hours before you are ready to put it in the oven so it has time to come up to room temperature. That flavoured butter will already be under the skin so you'll only need a few tweaks to finish it off. Halve the clementines and pop them in the cavity with a few more sprigs of fresh herbs like rosemary, bay and thyme. The fruit will steam and flavour the birds in a really lovely way. Take the fresh rosemary, pull off the leaves at the bottom then spear that through the loose skin around the cavity to hold it together and keep it from shrinking back as the turkey cooks. Open up the neck cavity and pack as much stuffing  as possible in there, then carefully pull the skin back over the cavity, tuck it under the bird and pop it in the roasting tray. If you've already made your gravy like I've done, you won't need a vegetable trivet, if not, do that now by roughly chopping the carrots, onions and celery sticks. Preheat your oven to full whack, get the turkey in the roasting tray and cover with foil. As soon as it goes in the oven, immediately turn the heat down to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. As a rough guide, you want to cook the turkey for about 35 to 40 minutes per kilogram, so a 7kg turkey will want about 4 to 4Â½ hours in the oven. But there are so many variables such as the sort of oven you have and the quality of your bird. Check on your turkey every 30 minutes or so and keep it from drying out by basting it with the lovely juices from the bottom of the pan. After 3Â½ hours, remove the foil so the skin gets golden and crispy. If you are at all worried just stick a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the breast. When the internal temperature has reached 65°C for a good quality bird, and about 82°C for a cheaper bird, it's ready to come out. Carefully put a metal skewer in the cavity and use it to lift the bird and angle it over the roasting tray so all of the juices from the cavity run out. Move the turkey to a platter then cover it with a double layer of tinfoil and 2 tea towels to keep it warm while it rests for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours for bigger birds."

Heat a saucepan until medium hot and add a splash of olive oil. Pick the sage leaves and add to the pan with 6 of the pancetta or bacon strips. Peel and chop 2 garlic cloves and 1 onion. Trim and chop the celery and add to the pan with the garlic and onion. Fry everything gently until soft and golden brown. Take the pan off the heat, add the breadcrumbs and, while the mix is cooling down, roughly chop the apricots and stir them in. When the stuffing has cooled down, add the pork, lemon zest, nutmeg, egg and lots of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, and mix everything together well.
Slice the remaining strips of pancetta or bacon in half and peel and slice 1 peeled garlic clove into thin slivers. Place a rosemary sprig and a garlic sliver on one end of a halved strip of pancetta and roll it up tightly. Repeat with the other pieces of pancetta until you have 12 little rolls. Stab the thighs and drumsticks of the turkey in 6 places on each side. Push a little pancetta roll into each hole until it just peeps out. This will give your turkey thighs a fantastic flavour and will keep them moist while they cook. Peel the remaining onions and chop in half, and peel and thickly slice the carrots. Give your turkey a good wipe, inside and out, with kitchen paper, and place it on a board, with the neck end towards you. Find the edge of the skin that's covering the turkey's breasts and gently peel it back. Work your fingers and then your hand under the skin, freeing it from the meat. If you're careful you should be able to pull all the skin away from the meat, keeping it attached at the sides. Go slowly and try not to make any holes!, Lift the loose skin at the neck end and spoon the stuffing between the skin and the breast, tucking the flap of skin underneath to stop anything leaking out. Pop the orange in the microwave for 30 seconds to warm it up and stuff it into the cavity. Weigh the stuffed turkey and calculate the cooking time (about 20 minutes per 500g/1lb 2oz). Place the bird on a large roasting tray, rub it all over with olive oil and season well. Surround with the chopped carrots, onions and remaining cloves of garlic, cover with tin foil and place in the preheated oven. Turn the heat down right away to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 and roast for the calculated time, or until the juices run clear from the thigh if you pierce it with a knife or a skewer. Remove the tin foil for the last 45 minutes to brown the bird. Carefully lift the turkey out of the tray and rest on a board covered loosely with foil for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours for bigger birds. When the resting time's nearly up, skim off the surface fat from the roasting tray and add the flour and stock. Place the tray on the hob and bring to the boil on a high heat. When the gravy starts to thicken, strain it into a bowl. Carve your turkey, serve with the gravy and dig in!"

This recipe is nice and simple and will help you achieve brilliant results for your Christmas meal. Take your turkey out of the fridge about an hour before you're ready to cook it so it comes up to room temperature before roasting. Give it a good rinse then pat it dry with some kitchen paper, making sure you soak up any water in the cavity. Drizzle the meat with a good lug of olive oil, add a few good sprinkles of salt and pepper and then rub this seasoning all over the bird, making sure you get in to all the nooks and crannies. Preheat your oven to full whack then get started on your stuffing. Pour a lug or two of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat and fry off your chopped onion for about 10 minutes or until softened. Stir in a good pinch of salt and pepper, the ground nutmeg and your chopped sage leaves, then continue to fry and stir for another minute or two. Spoon the onion mixture into a large bowl and let it cool completely. Once cooled, add your pork mince and breadcrumbs and use your hands to really scrunch everything together. Once it's mixed really well, bring the stuffing together into a ball, then cover and chill until you're ready to stuff your turkey. Pull the skin at the neck-end back so you can see a cavity and push about half of your stuffing inside your turkey. Not too much: you don't want to pack it so tightly it slows down the cooking. Once done, pull and fold the skin over the opening and tuck it under the bird so it looks nice. Turn the turkey around and drop a few small pieces of stuffing into the larger cavity along with your clementine halves and a few sprigs of rosemary. Place your roughly chopped veg in the bottom of a roasting pan and lay your turkey on top. Cover the turkey with tin foil then put it in the hot oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Cook for about 35 to 40 minutes per kilo. The 5kg bird in this recipe will take about 3 to 3Â½ hours. Check on your turkey every 20 minutes or so and keep it from drying out by basting it with the lovely juices from the bottom of the pan. After 2Â½ hours, remove the foil so the skin gets golden and crispy. When the time is up, take your turkey out of the oven and stick a small sharp knife into the fattest part of the thigh. If the juices run clear and the meat pulls apart easily, it's ready. If not, pop the turkey back in the oven to cook for a bit longer then check again. When you're confident it's cooked, rest the turkey for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours for bigger birds. Meanwhile you can get your veg and gravy ready."

Pick the mint and most of the coriander leaves into a bowl, then add the salad leaves and toss together. For the dressing, peel, finely grate and add the onion to a small bowl. Squeeze in the clementine and lime juice, then halve the pomegranate and squeeze half through your fingers to catch any seeds. Pour in three times as much extra virgin olive oil. Add the soy sauce and sesame oil. Peel and coarsely grate the ginger, then squeeze all the juice into the bowl, discarding the pulp. Give the dressing a good stir, and have a taste - if you want a little more salt, add a splash more soy. If you want more acid, add another squeeze of lime juice. Drizzle over enough dressing to coat the salad leaves, then use your hands to toss and dress them. Deseed and finely chop the chilli. Drizzle the honey into the pan with the turkey meat and stir through until coated. Turn the heat up to full whack for the last few seconds to really crisp up the meat mixture. At this point, make sure your guests are all at the table and ready to eat so you can serve the salad as soon as the hot meat hits the salad leaves. Toss half of the pan-fried ingredients through the salad leaves and transfer to a serving platter. Spoon the remaining nuts, cranberries and crispy meat over the top of the salad and add another drizzle of dressing.

Add the greens and pasta to the pan, and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente. This translates as â€˜to the tooth' and means that it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of a bite and firmness to it. Try some just before the time is up to make sure you cook it perfectly. Add a splash more stock or water to loosen, if needed. Pick over the basil leaves (if using) and stir through. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, then serve with a grating of Parmesan and a slice of wholemeal bread, if you like."

Have a taste and see whether you think it needs a bit more lemon juice or oil - you want it to be slightly too acidic, so that it's still nice and zingy once you've dressed your salad leaves. Use a knife to trim the roots away from all the lettuces. Separate out the leaves, throwing any tatty ones away. Pop them in a colander and give them a good wash under cold running water over the sink. Spin them dry in a salad spinner, or wrap in a clean tea towel and shake dry, then pile the leaves into a large salad bowl. Pick and add the herbs to the bowl, discarding the stalks. From a height, drizzle 3 tablespoons of the dressing over the leaves and gently toss together with the tips of your fingers until every leaf is coated - try not to be heavy-handed and don't be tempted to overdress or the leaves will go limp. Have a taste and add a splash more dressing, if needed - remember you can always add more but you can't take it away, so be cautious.

Place the tray on a medium heat on the hob and stir in the flour with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the sticky bits from the base and sides of the tray. Once combined, pour in the stock, or you can even use cooking water you've saved from your veggies. Bring to the boil, then leave to simmer gently for about 30 minutes, or as long as it needs to get to the consistency you desire. As it simmers, if any fat or foam rises to the surface, simply skim it away. If you want to add extra flavour, a swig of red wine, Vin Santo, sherry or port will work a treat. I also like to add a spoonful of jam or jelly for a touch of sweetness.

Add the sugar and vegetable stock (I try to use homemade stock, but if you've only got stock cubes, that's fine too), then cover and let it bubble away over a low heat for 30 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally - the longer you cook it, the more the flavour will develop as it reduces and thickens. When it's ready, fish out the bay leaf and season to how you like it (it's important to season the sauce right at the end - it will thicken and intensify in flavour as it cooks, so you might find it's salty enough already).

Firm up in the freezer for 10 minutes, then transfer to the fridge. Preheat the oven to 160°C/325°F/gas 3, while you make the vegan mayo and onion rings. For the mayo, trim and roughly chop the spring onions and chilli (deseeded if you like) and place in a blender. Peel and add the garlic, along with the chickpeas, mustard, tomato paste, brandy, lemon juice and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Blitz well to combine, then, with the blender still running, slowly pour in 4 to 5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil until smooth and the same consistency as mayonnaise. For the onion rings, peel the onion and slice horizontally into 2cm-wide rounds. Separate into rings, then place in a bowl with the vinegar and a pinch of salt. Leave for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the flour and baking powder in a bowl, then gently whisk in the ale until smooth, thick and coating the back of a spoon nicely. Place a medium, deep pan over a high heat, pour in the sunflower or sunseed oil and allow to heat up. To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a piece of bread into the pan - if it floats to the surface, sizzles and turns golden, it's about right. Drain the onions, dust a handful of them with flour until lightly coated, then dip them into the batter. Remove with a slotted spoon and allow any excess batter to drip off, then carefully lower into the hot oil. Cook for around 1 minute, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway with the slotted spoon. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain, then repeat with the remaining onion. When you're ready, cook the burgers in 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway and pressing down with a fish slice to get them nice and crispy. Transfer to a baking tray, then pop into the oven while you prepare the remaining ingredients. Finely shred the lettuce and mix with half the vegan mayo (keep the rest in the fridge for up to 2 days). Slice the tomatoes and place on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Sprinkle over a little salt and pick over the basil leaves. Top with another piece of kitchen paper and pat lightly to remove any excess water. Slice the gherkins lengthways, then halve and destone the avocado. Scoop out the flesh, cut into slices, then squeeze over the lime juice. Halve the burger buns and toast on a hot griddle pan or under the grill. Once ready, pile the dressed lettuce and sliced tomatoes and basil on to the burger bun bases. Pop the burgers on top, snip over the cress, then layer over the avocado, gherkins and crispy onion rings. Add a good squeeze of ketchup to the burger bun lids, place them on top, squeezing down gently, then tuck in."

For me, the Maris Piper potato wins every time, and you want to use nice large ones. On oil, sunflower and sunseed are very efficient, and many people swear by using groundnut oil. But, if you're after flavour, cooking chips in beef tallow (rendered beef fat you can get from your butcher) gives you better flavour and colour - the choice is yours. Finally, on salt, being an Essex boy, in my house it has to be Maldon sea salt. So down to business: chop 800g of Maris Piper potatoes into finger-sized chips, leaving the skin on - don't be too exact. Chip shops have massive industrial fryers, which you can't recreate at home, so you need to use a large sturdy pan on a medium to high heat (unless you own a deep-fat fryer, of course). Your oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full. If you don't have a thermometer, use a raw chip, and as it starts to float and fry the temperature should be about 140°C, which is perfect for blanching. Use a large metal sieve to gently lower the chips into the pan for around 8 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, then remove to a tray to cool. Turn the heat up under the oil and return one blanched chip to the oil as a guide again. Once it's floating and golden the temperature should be about 180°C, which is perfect for frying and will give you chips with those all-important crispy outsides and fluffy middles. At this stage you may want to cook your chips in 2-portion batches, so you don't decrease the temperature of the oil too much or overcrowd the pan. Fry the chips until beautifully golden, then remove to a bowl lined with kitchen paper, shake around a bit, season with sea salt and serve right away."

Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 100ml of hand-hot (not boiling) water, then add it to the flour mixture with the oil and 60 to 75ml of hot water and mix until you have a soft, but not sticky, dough. Knead for 5 minutes. Pop the dough into an oiled bowl, cover with oiled clingfilm and set aside to rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Then, with oiled hands, divide the dough into 8 and roughly roll each one into a thin oval. Stack them up, separating them with baking paper to stop them from sticking together. Heat a griddle pan until it's smoking hot and add the flatbreads (you'll need to do this in batches). Cook for a couple of minutes on each side, until charred and puffed up. Keep warm in a tea towel while cooking the rest. Gently reheat the soup, and serve with a swirl of cream, a scattering of herby fennel tops (if you have them) and the hot flatbreads."

Trim the radishes and wash with the beetroot leaves. To make your sauce, peel the garlic cloves and put into a saucepan with the milk and anchovies, then bring to the boil.

This is ideal for a light lunch served with grilled fish or meat, or treated as a warm salad in part of a bigger spread. Let your barbecue die down ready to cook or put a griddle pan on a high heat to get nice and hot. Slice the aubergine about 1cm thick, slice the fennel bulb at an angle about 3mm thick, then slice the courgettes lengthways in about the same thickness as the fennel. Snap the woody ends off of the asparagus. Leave the peppers and patty pans, if using, whole. Pile everything onto a large tray ready to cook. In batches, add the veg to your barbecue or hot griddle to cook for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until charred, soft and delicious. Remember that each vegetable will cook in a different amount of time so keep checking and turning everything and as soon as it is looking good, transfer it to a large bowl (keeping the cooked peppers and patty pans to one side) and get the next lot of veg on. Carefully remove the black skin on the peppers, open them up and scrape away the seeds. Don't worry about getting all of the skin off but do the best you can. This is a messy job but totally worth it! Tear the peppers up into strands and add to the bowl. Halve the patty pans and add those too, along with the extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar and a good pinch of salt and pepper.

As soon as it comes to the boil, remove the pan from the heat. Strain the sauce through a coarse sieve into a bowl, using your wooden spoon to push any larger bits of tomato through. Discard the basil and garlic that will be left in the sieve, but make sure you scrape any of the tomatoey goodness off the back of the sieve into the bowl. Pour the sauce back into the pan, bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer for 5 minutes to concentrate the flavours. It will be ready when it's the perfect consistency for spreading on your pizza. Store the sauce in a clean jar in the fridge - it'll keep for a week or so."

You can halve the cherry tomatoes or leave them whole. Then sprinkle them all with a good dusting of sea salt. Put them in a colander and leave them for 30 minutes. What's going to happen here is that the salt will draw the excess moisture out of the tomatoes, intensifying their flavour. Don't worry about the salad being too salty, as a lot of the salt drips away. Place the tomatoes in a large bowl and dress with enough extra virgin olive oil to loosen (approximately 6 tablespoons), and 1-2 tablespoons of vinegar, but do add these to your own taste. Toss around and check for seasoning - you may or may not need salt but will certainly need pepper. Add the garlic. Now start to add the horseradish. Stir in a couple of teaspoons to begin with, toss around and taste. If you like it a bit hotter, add a bit more horseradish. All I do now is get some finely sliced flat-leaf parsley (stalks and leaves) and mix this into the tomatoes. Toss everything together and serve as a wonderful salad, making sure you mop up all the juices with some nice squashy bread. This salad is fantastic with roast beef, goat's cheese or jacket potatoes.

A lot of the veg stalls have massive cauldrons of boiled potatoes and artichokes to serve to their customers - I guess you could say this is the original fast food - and they tasted absolutely brilliant. Some of the stalls also make a version of this salad, which is absolutely delicious. They tend to dress it and have it hanging around for quite some time so it becomes a bit sloppy and past its best, but the principle of the salad is fantastic and all the locals absolutely adore it. In Sicily you can get these terrific Cedro lemons which are mainly pith and they are amazing in salads - but you may not be able to get hold of them. In this case I wouldn't recommend you use normal lemons as the flavour is quite different. The way potatoes are cooked in Sicily is very long and very slow, on a low simmer with plenty of salt in the water. This is a fantastic method of making normal potatoes soft and floury, but in the case of new potatoes it would be a crime. So add them to fast-boiling salted water, as this will help retain a lot of their flavour, and cook them till nice and tender. The softer you can get them while still holding their shape, the better. While the potatoes are cooking, wash all your salad leaves and put them into a nice big bowl with the mint and fennel. If using a Cedro lemon, add the slices to the salad at this point. For the dressing, mix the orange juice and vinegar in a glass jar or bowl with about twice as much extra virgin olive oil. Add the oregano and capers and season to taste with salt and pepper. Give it a good mix and have a taste. Don't forget that you want the flavour to be a little over the top, so that by the time you've dressed the salad with it and it has mixed with all the other flavours it's perfect because it's become more subtle. Drain the potatoes when cooked, then allow them to steam in a colander for 5 minutes. Throw them into the salad while still warm and toss together well. Absolutely fantastic - great with a plate of grilled fish or as a lunchie salad on its own."

First, you have got to get your hungry guests around the table before you plate up, so as soon as their bums are on the chairs, you are tossing the warm ingredients in with the rocket leaves. Boom, boom, boom on a plate and it's in front of them. Peel, halve and quarter 2 medium red onions, then quarter again, to give you 8 pieces from each onion. Heat a frying pan and fry off 8 whole rashers of pancetta or smoked streaky bacon until crisp. Remove, add a couple of lugs of olive oil to the pan, and add 4 sprigs of thyme, the onions and a good handful of pine nuts with a tiny pinch of salt. Toss around and fry on a medium heat for about 5 minutes until caramelized and sweet (not black!). Put your pancetta or bacon back into the pan, toss around, then throw everything into a salad bowl with 4 big handfuls of rocket or any nice salad leaves.

Although called artichokes they're actually tubers - like rough and ready potatoes. You can scrub and roast them whole like mini jacket potatoes and split them open, drizzled with a little chilli oil. You can even use them in a salad with smoky bacon. A Jerusalem artichoke's best friends are sage, thyme, butter, bacon, bay, cream, breadcrumbs, cheese and anything smoked. To serve 4, you will need 600g/1lb 6oz of Jerusalem artichokes. Peel them, then cut them into chunks. Place them in an oiled frying pan and fry on a medium heat until golden on both sides, then add a few bay leaves, 2 cloves of garlic, finely sliced, a splash of white wine vinegar, some salt and pepper, and place a lid on top. After about 20 to 25 minutes they will have softened up nicely and you can remove the lid and the bay leaves. Continue cooking for a couple of minutes to crisp the artichoke slices up one last time, then serve straight away.

Halve and deseed the pepper, then cut each half into 4 pieces. Peel the red onion and cut into 8 wedges. Carefully cut the squash in half then scoop out and discard the seeds. Cut each half into 2cm chunks. Wash and trim the baby leeks. Halve the courgettes lengthways then slice into 2cm chunks. Top and tail the aubergine, cut it into quarters, then into 2cm chunks. Quarter the tomatoes. Leave the cloves of garlic in their skins but squash them with the heel of your hand. Put all the veg in an extra large roasting tray, or 2 smaller ones. Crush the coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar then scatter over the veg with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Pick and roughly chop the rosemary leaves. Pick the thyme leaves. Scatter all of the herbs over the veg. Drizzle it all well with olive oil, then toss to coat. To cook and serve your vegetables:
Roast your veg in the hot oven for around 50 minutes, or until soft, golden and cooked through. Serve with anything from roast chicken to grilled meats or fish, or try tossing with pasta or couscous for a simple veggie meal. Jamie's top tips:, If the vegetables seem crowded in a single roasting pan, divide them between two. Overcrowding the pan will stop enough heat getting to the vegetables and they will steam rather than roast. Turning the vegetables as they roast helps them to cook evenly. If you're using two roasting pans, swap them round half way through cooking.
Roasting is a great way to make veg taste delicious, and it works for just about any combo - just make sure your oven is fairly hot, the veg are roughly the same size and that they get a good stir every now and again. You can also make this ahead of time and eat it cold - it's just as delicious!"

Allow to boil for 5 minutes, then add the parsnips and cook for another 4 minutes. Drain in a colander and allow to steam dry. Take out the carrots and parsnips and put to one side. Fluff up the potatoes in the colander by shaking it around a little - it's important to â€˜chuff them up' like this if you want them to have all those lovely crispy bits when they're cooked. Put a large roasting tray over a medium heat and either add a few generous lugs of olive oil or carefully spoon a little of the fat from the meat you're cooking, and add the garlic and rosemary. Tip the vegetables into the tray, season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper and turn the veg over to coat them in the flavours. Spread them out evenly into one layer - this is important, as you want them to roast, not steam as they will if you have them all on top of each other.

Give the colander a bit of a shake to help chuff up the potatoes - this will help to make them super-crisp later on. At this point, you need to decide which flavour combo to go with. Tip the potatoes into a large tray in one layer, and add the fat - olive oil, butter or goose fat - then season really well with sea salt and black pepper. Toss the potatoes in the fat (you could get the potatoes up to this stage the day before, simply cover them with clingfilm or tin foil and pop in the fridge or in a cool place until needed), then roast for 30 minutes, or until lightly golden and three quarters cooked. Now's the time for my trick. Gently squash each potato with a potato masher to increase the surface area - the more of your potato that's in contact with the pan, the crispier it will be. Add 1 good lug of oil to a small bowl and pick and/or tear in the herbs. If opting for flavour combo 2, peel in a good few strips of clementine zest with a speed-peeler - you won't eat these but they'll add amazing flavour. Break up the garlic bulb, adding the unpeeled cloves to the bowl, along with a splash of red wine vinegar, then scrunch and mix it up a bit.

Dried beans can take up to an hour, but check fresh ones after 25 minutes. Drain (reserving about half a glass of the cooking water), and discard the bay leaf, tomato and potato.

When I'm doing mine I round up friends and family to get the job done quicker. I also put the larger ones in one bowl and the smaller ones in another - they'll need different cooking times. Blanch the beans in unsalted boiling water for a couple of minutes, giving the large ones a bit longer (don't add salt, as this will toughen the skins). Drain them and lay them flat on a tray to cool down slightly. This salad always works best when the beans are eaten slightly warm. If you're making it in advance, though, you could always give them a quick flash in the microwave just before serving. Remove the skins from the larger beans if necessary. Place in a bowl and dress with the juice of 1 lemon and three times as much extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Add a little more lemon juice if needed - feel free to adjust to your taste. At this stage I like to finely slice half the mint and add it to the beans while they sit and marinate for a little while. In a shallow pan, on a medium heat, fry the chopped onion, cumin seeds and chilli in a little olive oil. Stir and cook until softened. As the onions start to colour, add your breadcrumbs and mix these really well into the onions. Continue to cook until the crumbs are crispy and golden, then season them to taste and put to one side. To serve, divide the yoghurt or soured cream between four plates or bowls. Give the broad beans a final toss, add the rest of the mint leaves, and divide between the plates on top of the yoghurt. Finally, sprinkle over the warm spiced crunchy bits. Sometimes I like to zest a bit of lemon over the top to give a little edge.

Veg-wise, the onion, coriander and white cabbage are non-negotiable, as they form the base of this salad, but feel free to have a play with the other ingredients and use things like fennel or asparagus. Basically whatever's in season and available should be a nice addition. The easiest and quickest way to make this is to use a food processor with a slicer attachment or a mandolin. If you don't have either of those, use a speed peeler, or simply grate everything finely. Shred your white and red cabbage into two separate piles. Put just the white cabbage into a large bowl with the radishes, carrots and most of the coriander.

The great thing about it is that you can use any combination of greens, such as baby cabbage leaves, Swiss chard and even salad leaves like cos, gem or Romaine. You can easily buy a big bag of spinach, rocket and watercress and use some yellow celery leaves and other herbs like basil, parsley, sorrel and fennel tops to give you a good mixture. Most Italians have a vegetable garden, and no matter how big or small it is they always have greens and veggies to hand. This recipe sees the more robust leaves blanched first, then wilted down in a pan with the salad leaves, herbs and garlic until soft and tender. Blanch the cabbage leaves and chard to perfection in a pot of salted boiling water for a couple of minutes, then drain in a colander and leave to cool down a little. Put a couple of good lugs of olive oil into a large frying pan or casserole type dish and add the sliced garlic. As soon as it starts to take on the smallest amount of colour, throw in your salad leaves then the cabbage and Swiss chard. Cook on a medium heat for about 4 to 5 minutes, moving the greens around the pan with a spoon or a pair of tongs, then add your herbs and cook for a further minute. Remove from the heat and season carefully to taste with salt and pepper, some good-quality extra virgin olive oil and enough lemon juice to give it a little kick."

Put all the tomatoes into a large salad bowl. Slice the onion very finely so it's wafer thin and add to the tomatoes. Scratch a fork down the sides of the cucumber so it leaves deep grooves in the skin, then cut it into thick slices. Deseed your pepper, slice it into rings and add them to the salad along with the cucumber. Roughly chop the dill and most of the mint leaves, reserving the smaller ones for garnish. Add the chopped herbs to the bowl of salad, then squeeze your handful of olives over so they season the vegetables, then drop them in. Add a pinch of sea salt, the vinegar and the extra virgin olive oil. Quickly toss everything together with your hands. The minute all those flavours start working with the veg is when the magic starts to happen. Have a taste, and adjust the flavours if need be. To serve, pop the block of feta right on the top of the salad. Sprinkle the oregano over the top along with the reserved mint leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and take it straight to the table. It's confident and scruffy with a bit of attitude. Delicious. PS I've been known to pop leftover Greek salad into a liquidizer with a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a few ice cubes, then blitz it up to a smooth consistency so it's basically a Greek gazpacho.

Look at the gorditas as a tasty spoon for carrying all kinds of big exciting flavours. Mexicans put all sorts of things, from beans, to meat, to salsa, on them. I've gone for quite a delicious and delicate apple salsa here - give it a try. Put the cornmeal and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Mix the baking powder into the hot water and pour this into the well. Using a fork, mix the cornmeal into the liquid, and when it starts to come together use your hands to knead it. Divide the dough into 16 equal squash-ball-sized pieces and dust them lightly with flour. Roll each piece around in your hands, then pat and flatten into a small round roughly the size of the base of a wine glass. Put these on an oiled tray, dust with flour and put aside while you make your salsa. Finely chop your apple, tomatoes and spring onions, and finely slice your chilli. Put them all into a bowl. Pick the leaves from your coriander and put them into a bowl of water until you're ready to serve. Chop the coriander stalks up nice and finely and add to the bowl with the other salsa ingredients.  Put a large pan on a medium heat and add your pumpkin and sunflower seeds. Toss them around for a few minutes and toast them. Add them to your salsa with the juice of your lime, a good lug of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well, then have a taste and add a little more seasoning, lime juice or chilli if you think it needs more attitude. Put the pan back on a medium heat and add a couple of good lugs of olive oil. Cook as many gorditas as will comfortably fit into the pan for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until they're golden and puff up a little. Serve the gorditas warm out of the pan with a tablespoon of your beautiful salsa, a little hunk of cheese, a couple of your drained coriander leaves and a few slices of chilli, if you fancy, and with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over."

Season carefully with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, then add the finely chopped shallot, the capers if you're using them and the garlic. Remove one of the beans from the pan to check if it's cooked. If it holds its shape but is also soft to the bite, it's perfect. Drain in a colander. Now, while the beans are steaming hot, this is the perfect moment to dress them - a hot bean will take on more of the wonderful dressing than a cold one. It is best to serve the beans warm, not cold, and certainly not at fridge temperature because the flavours will be muted and boring. Serve the beans in a bowl, sprinkled with chervil if you like - it's a delicate, crunchy herb that goes well with beans. Serve as a salad in its own right, or as an accompaniment to a main meal."

Stir everything round and add the onions, shallots and leeks. Season with sea salt and black pepper. Place a lid on the pan, leaving it slightly ajar, and cook slowly for 50 minutes, without colouring the vegetables too much. Remove the lid for the last 20 minutes - your onions will become soft and golden. Stir occasionally so that nothing catches on the bottom. Having the patience to cook the onions slowly, slowly, gives you an incredible sweetness and an awesome flavour, so don't be tempted to speed this bit up. When your onions and leeks are lovely and silky, add the stock. Bring to the boil, turn the heat down and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. You can skim any fat off the surface if you like, but I prefer to leave it because it adds good flavour. Preheat the oven or grill to maximum. Toast your bread on both sides. Correct the seasoning of the soup. When it's perfect, ladle it into individual heatproof serving bowls and place them on a baking tray. Tear toasted bread over each bowl to fit it like a lid. Feel free to push and dunk the bread into the soup a bit. Grate over some of the Cheddar and drizzle over a little Worcestershire sauce. Dress your reserved sage leaves with some olive oil and place one on top of each slice of bread. Put the baking tray into the preheated oven or under the grill to melt the cheese until bubbling and golden. Keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn't burn!

Place the lid on top and bring to the boil, then remove the lid and simmer for a minute or two while you finely slice a handful of mint leaves. With this reasonably small amount of liquid, the butter and wine should form a fantastically simple sauce. Throw in the mint at the last minute and serve straight away.

Although I have called it â€˜Keralan', it isn't really a true salad from there as you'd never find cress in Kerala!, In Rasa, Das uses a lot of fresh coconut - which really is one of the most incredible flavours for making dishes like curries, or mixed into rice, breads, desserts and salads. You can now buy coconuts from most supermarkets, but if you can't find one, feel free to make this salad without it - it will still be pretty good but it won't have that special edge to it. Only make this when the mangoes are silky smooth and not at all stringy. You should be able to cut through them like butter. First of all you need to crack open the shell of the coconut. I normally do this by placing it on a tea towel on a hard surface and then giving it a wallop with a rolling-pin or a hammer. Once you've cracked it open you can pull it apart (being careful not to spill the milk everywhere!), discarding the hard outer shell. The dark skin on the outside of the coconut's flesh doesn't bother me, especially if I'm grating it. But if you want to remove it, a speed peeler works quite well. Once you've got into your coconut, cut the peppers into quarters, remove the stalks and seeds, then finely slice. Trim your cress directly from its punnet (the easiest way to do this is to take the cress out of the punnet, wash the leafy end and stalks under a tap, then slice the stalk end off and discard it). Trim your spring onions and finely slice them. Cut the mango flesh off the stones and finely slice it (there is a knack to doing this properly - if you look at the shape of the mango, the flat stone always lies the same way, parallel with the flattest sides, so you should be able to slice the flesh off with not too much wastage). Get your pieces of coconut and grate them finely. Put all these ingredients into a large salad bowl. Lime and ginger work together really well in the dressing. Finely grate the ginger and lime zest into a small bowl, then add the lime juice and olive oil. Season to taste, and add more oil as necessary to balance the flavours of your dressing. Limes can be different strengths depending on their juiciness and size. Dress the salad just before serving, saving any extra dressing for another day, and eat straight away. Great just as it is, or with some grilled prawns or satay chicken. Also lovely as a snack inside a wrap or flatbread. So even though the coconut may be a pain to prepare it's well worth it..."

Here are some tips on buying and preparing a selection of veg... In most supermarkets these days you can get fresh baby carrots with their green tops. Leave about an inch of the tops on and just give the carrots a scrub. Do the same with some lovely radishes. You can get some marbled pink and white oval ones now, which are crunchy and peppery. Again, leave the tops on as these make good handles when it comes to dipping. Use nice crunchy lettuces. Sweeter lettuces like cos and romaine are good for dipping - I try to use the inner part, keeping the outer leaves for another salad. I leave the stalk on and then cut the lettuce into quarters, and that way they stay in one piece, but you don't have to do this. The important thing is to get good chunks of vegetables. I like to contrast the sweet lettuces with slightly more bitter ones like radicchio or endive. If you've got some young asparagus that's just come into season, it's really nice eaten raw. Feel free to use your imagination on the veggie side. Little fingers of celery or celeriac are also good. However, you often come across people who use raw cauliflower with dips - I personally would prefer colonic irrigation! I think cauliflower and broccoli are just awful eaten raw, so I wouldn't suggest using them here. Put the yoghurt in a food processor, pick in the mint leaves and whiz up for half a minute or so. Add the peas and the Parmesan, and whiz again - the peas will break down and the yoghurt will become green. Put the dip in a bowl, correcting the seasoning with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice. When you add the lemon juice and peas to the yoghurt, quite often it splits and turns into a kind of cheese, but this is absolutely fine. It depends on the type of yoghurt you use and how acidic your lemon is. Just pour away any excess water. Usually, though, it doesn't split and is more like a purée, but both ways are good. Serve your veggies on a big board or in a big bowl next to the dip. And have some salt and pepper to hand in case you need it. It's a good sociable way to start a meal."

Tear off the tough outer leaves until you get to the softer inner green ones. Open them out, then use a teaspoon to scrape out the furry chokes and discard. If you're doing this ahead, put the artichokes in a bowl of water with a little lemon juice to stop them discolouring. Drizzle the inside of each artichoke with olive oil and season well. Stuff each one with a small lemon wedge, a rolled-up slice of prosciutto and a bay leaf. Wet 4 sheets of baking paper, then scrunch up and wrap 1 around each artichoke.

As soon as the carrots are cooked, drain them, discard the herbs and all but one of the orange pieces, squeeze the garlic out of its skin, chop the remaining orange piece finely and toss with the carrots, some seasoning and a little more butter. The flavour will be incredible. Another idea is to fry the chopped-up orange in a good tablespoon of sugar, so it almost jammifies, and serve this on top of the carrots. These two flavours together are one of the coolest things. Or, roasted carrots with orange, garlic and thyme: just as easy - as soon as you drain the carrots you can throw them into a baking tray with the chopped-up orange and the garlic cloves and roast them at 200°C/400°F/gas 6 for 10 minutes - this will give you a slightly meatier flavour.
