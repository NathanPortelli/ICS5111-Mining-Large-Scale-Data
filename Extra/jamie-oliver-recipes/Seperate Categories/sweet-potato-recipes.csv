Place in a roasting tray and cook in the oven for 30 minutes., Meanwhile, trim the tough end off 1 broccoli stalk, slice it, then chop the rest into large florets. Toss the broccoli into the sweet potato tray with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Roast for another 30 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are cooked through., Toast 25g of cashew nuts and 25g of mixed pumpkin, sunflower and sesame seeds in a dry frying pan on a medium heat until smelling fantastic, then crush in the pestle and mortar., Bash and mush up 250g of vac-packed beetroot in their pack as much as you can, then snip the corner off and decant into a bowl with 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Mix together, mashing with a fork, if needed., Cook 300g of quinoa according to the packet instructions, and drain well. Pick and finely chop the leaves from 1 bunch of mint (reserving the pretty ones for garnish) and stir through the quinoa with the finely grated zest and the juice from 1 lemon, then season to perfection., Scatter the quinoa across a large platter. Once cool enough to handle, tear over chunks of roasted sweet potato and dot over the roasted broccoli. Halve 1 ripe avocado and use a teaspoon to add curls of flesh to the platter.

Roast for 40 minutes, or until soft, golden and gnarly., Place a small pan on a medium heat with 1 teaspoon of olive oil., Peel and finely slice 2 cloves of garlic, then add to the pan along with ½ a teaspoon each of sweet smoked paprika and ground cumin. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes, then tip in 1 x 400g tin of black beans (juice and all), plus 1 tin’s worth of water and simmer for 5 minutes., Season to taste, then remove from the heat and blitz with a hand blender until smooth. Return to a low heat and leave to tick away., Meanwhile, cook 150g of long grain rice in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain., Place 200g of spinach in a colander above the rice and leave to wilt for a few minutes, then squeeze out any excess water., For the salsa, trim and finely slice 6 spring onions, then place in a bowl with the 100g of sliced pickled jalapeños and a splash of pickling juice. Pick in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh coriander (15g) and give everything a good mix., To assemble the burritos, load up the tortillas with the sweet potatoes, rice and spinach, wrap up, then slice in half. Pour the black bean sauce between 4 plates, and arrange the burritos on top. Serve each topped with some jalapeño salsa and 1 tablespoon of dairy-free yoghurt. Cut 1 to 2 limes into wedges for squeezing over."

and sweet potatoes and chop into 2cm chunks, cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 10 minutes, or until tender, then drain and steam dry., Peel the garlic and ginger, finely chop with the chilli, and place in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat with the butter, garam masala and mustard seeds., After 1 minute, tip and mash in the potatoes, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Keep frying until crispy, then mix up and allow to get crispy again., Divide roughly into 4 (still in the pan), then use 2 spoons to crudely mould and shape into balls, patiently frying and turning until kind of rounded, really golden and crispy all over (trust me, these are amazing!)., Spoon the mango chutney into a bowl, squeeze in enough pomegranate juice to loosen, then mix together with a handful of the pomegranate seeds., Whiz the mint leaves in a blender with the yoghurt until smooth. Split the rolls open and lightly toast on the inside, and roughly crush the Bombay mix., Spoon a dollop of mint yoghurt on to each bun base, top with a hot potato ball, a little mango chutney and Bombay mix, then pop the lid on and squash."

Tip into your pestle and mortar with the chillies, add 1 tablespoon of coconut cream and pound to a paste – put some welly into it!, Peel the lime zest, then finely chop the rind and pound with the chillies., Peel and finely slice the galangal, trim the lemongrass, discarding the tough outer layer, and finely chop. Peel the garlic, wash and chop the coriander roots or stalks, and peel and finely slice the shallots (setting aside a large handful of sliced shallots for later). Char your chopped ingredients in a hot wok over a high heat for 2 to 3 minutes., Add your charred ingredients to the paste mixture and continue to pound until smooth, adding 1-2 tablespoons more of coconut cream if needed. Alternatively, scrape the paste and charred ingredients into a liquidiser with a little extra coconut cream and pulse until smooth., Add the shrimp paste to the wok, fry it off for 1 minute, then bash or whiz with your curry paste until combined.

Give it a good stir and let it bubble away for a couple of minutes., Tip in the beef, peanuts and coconut milk, and bring to the boil., Reduce the heat to low, cover, and leave to tick away for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally., Peel and roughly chop the onion, then peel the potatoes and chop into 3cm chunks. Add to the wok, along with the fish sauce and palm sugar, then give everything a good stir. Cover and continue cooking for 25 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the potato is soft, adding a splash of boiling water to loosen, if necessary. Have a taste and season with a little more fish sauce, if needed., For the salad, trim the beans and steam with the bok choi for 3 minutes or until just cooked – you want the beans to be soft enough to bend, but with a little bite. Run under cold water and then cut into three and tie into knots. Shave the carrots into long ribbons with a speed peeler, then score the length of the cucumber with a fork and slice into rounds. Arrange on a platter with the beansprouts and fresh herbs., For the dressing, peel and finely chop the garlic and galangal, deseed and finely chop the chilli. Finely zest 1 lime, then roll and squeeze the juice of both into a small bowl. Add the garlic, galangal, chilli, fish sauce, vinegar and sugar, and whisk to combine.

I took that delicious base and turned it into a great one-tray meal by adding supremes of chicken. You might think it’s unusual to marinate the chicken in brine, but it makes it outrageously soft and juicy. Give it at least 2 hours to marinate, but if you really want the full benefit, overnight is best. ”",820,37.7g,18.5g,15.2g,1.9g,56.2g,68.3g,4.2g,"4

Mix together in a large bowl with the honey and vinegar, then squeeze in the lemon juice and finely grate over the zest. Add the chicken, 2 tablespoons of sea salt and 1 litre of water, and cover with clingfilm. Leave in the fridge for at least 2 to 8 hours, but preferably overnight., When ready to cook, take the chicken out of the fridge so it can come up to room temperature and preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Finely chop the bacon, then scrub and finely slice the potatoes and sweet potatoes. Peel and finely slice the onion and garlic, then pick and finely chop the sage leaves, discarding the stalks., Get yourself a wide casserole-type pan or a roasting tray and add the bacon, all the sliced veg, garlic and the sage. Add a lug of olive oil and a good pinch of salt and black pepper and toss everything together., Pour the chicken stock into the pan or tray, then put into the oven for 30 minutes so the potatoes can begin to soften and soak up the stock., Drain the chicken breasts, discarding the brine, and pat them dry with kitchen paper., Take the potatoes out of the oven and pour over the cream. Sprinkle over a little more black pepper and finely grate over the Parmesan, then use a spoon to make little nests in the vegetables for the pieces of chicken to sit in. Place the chicken in these nests and dot little knobs of butter on and around the breasts., Return the tray to the oven to cook for 35 minutes, or until the chicken is golden and cooked through and the potatoes are delicious. To check if your chicken is cooked through, simply stick a sharp knife into the thickest part.

Do the same with 100g of radishes and 4 ripe tomatoes, halving the tomatoes first., Place the bashed salad veg (juices and all) into a bowl, drizzle over 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, then season to taste with sea salt and black pepper. Pick and tear in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh coriander (15g), then toss everything together., Place a large frying pan over a medium heat to warm up while you trim and finely slice 8 spring onions, grate 30g of Cheddar and mash the sweet potato (leaving the skin on)., Place 1 tortilla into the pan, sprinkle over half the cheese and spring onions, then top with all the sweet potato., Add a good few shakes of chipotle Tabasco sauce, scatter over the remaining spring onions and cheese, then top with the remaining tortilla, pressing down slightly., Carefully flip the tortilla and continue cooking for 1 further minute, or until golden and crisp. Slide onto a board and cut into 8 wedges., Destone ½ a ripe avocado (if needed), drizzle over 1 teaspoon each of extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar, then place on the board., Put 2 heaped tablespoons of natural yoghurt into a small bowl, and swirl through a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a few dashes of chipotle Tabasco., Serve the quesadilla wedges with the salad, avo and dollops of yoghurt. Slice ½ a lime into wedges for squeezing over, then get stuck in."

lightly golden, stir them into the tray. Finely slice and stir in the stalks from ½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley.

Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the spinach has thawed., Chop 4 salmon fillets into bite-sized chunks, halve 200g of raw peeled prawns, finely chop the parsley leaves and stir it all through the sauce with 400g of frozen peas, then crumble 125g of feta over the top and turn the heat off., Meanwhile, wash 600g each of sweet potatoes and spuds (leaving the skins on for extra nutritional benefit) and chop into 3cm chunks.

beans, 3 x 14-oz cans of plum tomatoes, 8 small baking potatoes, 5 oz Cheddar cheese, 4 little gem lettuces or hearts of romaine, 8 tablespoons plain yogurt","Put a large casserole dish on a medium-low heat and a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat., Prick the peppers, then sit them directly on the gas flame, or under a hot grill, for 10 minutes, until charred (keep an eye on them!). Meanwhile, scrub the sweet potatoes and slice into 2cm chunks (there’s no need to peel them), then char in the hot, dry frying pan for 5 minutes, turning them halfway through., Meanwhile, peel the onions and cut into 1cm chunks, then dry-fry in the casserole dish for 3 minutes until softened. Push them to the side and drizzle in 2 tablespoons of oil, then stir in the cumin seeds, paprika, cocoa powder and peanut butter. Add 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar and scrape up any sticky bits from the bottom of the pan, then stir in the charred sweet potato., Prick the chillies and blacken all over in the hot frying pan or directly over the gas flame. Carefully place the charred peppers on a board, then deseed and roughly chop, adding them to the casserole dish as you go. Carefully remove the charred chillies to a board, then finely chop and add to the mix., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Strain the butter beans in a sieve over the casserole dish, so the juices go straight in, then tip the beans into a the hot, dry frying pan and leave them in an even layer, without stirring, until they start to char and pop, then tip into the veg., Tip in the chickpeas (juice and all) and scrunch in the tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, then pour in 1 tin’s worth of water. Finely chop and add the coriander stalks (saving the leaves for later), season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and stir well, then pop on the lid, leaving a little opening, and cook for 1 hour, or until thickened, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, scrub the potatoes and dry with a clean tea towel. Prick them all over with a fork and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt, then place on a baking tray and bake for 1 hour, or until crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle., For the salsa, peel the onion and thinly slice with the apple, then tip into a small bowl, dress with the lime juice and season to perfection., For the cheat’s chilli sauce, blitz the jalapeños and their vinegar with the mint in a food processor until smooth., When you’re ready to serve, finely chop the coriander leaves and stir through the chilli with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Grate the cheese and click off the lettuce leaves., To serve, cut a cross into each baked spud, pinching the bottoms so they open up, and transfer to serving plates. Top with the cheese, stuffing it in well, then add a good spoonful of the chilli and serve with the lettuce leaves, a dollop of yoghurt, a sprinkling of the salsa and a drizzle of the chilli sauce., Put a large casserole pan on a medium-low heat and a grill pan beside it on a high heat. The idea here is to work in batches, starting by charring the veg on the grill to add a smoky flavor dimension. Peel the onions and cut into ½-inch dice, char on the grill for 3 minutes, then place in the casserole pan with 2 tablespoons of oil, the cumin seeds, paprika, cocoa, and peanut butter, stirring occasionally. Slice the chile(s) ½ inch thick and grill while you seed and roughly chop the peppers and chop the sweet potatoes into rough ¾-inch chunks (leave the skin on for extra nutritional benefit, just give them a wash). Grill it all, adding to the casserole pan as you go. Finely chop and add the cilantro stalks., Preheat the oven to 350°F. Drain the beans in a sieve over the casserole pan so the juices go in, then tip the beans into the grill pan in an even layer. Have faith and leave them without stirring until they start to char and burst, then add to the veg. Pour in the canned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Stir well, then pop the lid on ajar and leave for 1 hour, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, wash the potatoes, prick, then bake for 1 hour, or until crispy on the outside, fluffy in the middle., Just before serving, finely chop the cilantro leaves and stir through the chili, taste, and season to perfection. Cut a cross into each spud, pinching the bottoms so they open up, then grate the cheese and divide it between them, stuffing it in well.

Carefully pour onto a sheet of greaseproof paper, leave to cool and don’t touch!, Cut a cross in the top of your cooked potatoes and gently break them open with a fork, mashing a little of the inside as you go., Spoon over a good dollop of the spiced yoghurt, followed by the juicy grated salad, and the seeds.

It’s also a non-starchy carb, so unlike regular potato, it counts towards your 5–a–day, which means combined with all the other veg, this dish boasts three of your 5-a-day. ”",557,13.2g,3.1g,20.3g,1.3g,24.1g,83.9g,18.1g,"1 x                                                                                                                                                                350g                                                                                                                                                                sweet potato, olive oil, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                mixed seeds, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                quinoa, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                     lemon, 1                                                                                                                                                                clove of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, ½                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                smoked paprika, 1 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                black beans, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ripe tomatoes, 30                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                slice pickled jalapeños, extra virgin olive oil, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                 natural yoghurt, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                baby spinach","Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Halve the sweet potato lengthways, rub with a little oil, sea salt and black pepper, then place cut-side down on a baking tray.

It will take about 5 minutes to get a lovely golden colour. You may need to cook the chicken in batches if you have a small pan. Use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken pieces and set aside., Pour away any excess fat and then, in the same pan, cook the bacon lardons and onions for about 5 minutes until they have taken on some colour., Add the sweet potato and mushrooms and then return the chicken pieces to the pan, placing them on top, skin side up., Pour over the stock until it just reaches the chicken skin, add the thyme and cover with a lid., Leave to simmer very gently for about 10–15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. The cooking time will depend on the size of the chicken pieces so do check by removing a piece of chicken and cutting into it with a sharp knife., If you end up having more sauce than you’d like in the pan, simply strain into a clean saucepan, bring to the boil and reduce down and thicken by boiling it."

Sprinkle over a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and 1½ teaspoons of paprika (save the rest for the burgers). Drizzle with ½ tablespoon of olive oil, toss to coat and spread in one layer onto two baking trays., Bake in the hot oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through., While your wedges are cooking, drain the chickpeas and sweetcorn and place in a food processor. Pick the coriander leaves, then add half to the processor along with all of the stalks. If you don’t have a food processor, place in a bowl and mash with a potato masher or fork., Add the spices, flour and a pinch of sea salt, grate in the lemon zest, then pulse until combined, but not smooth – you want to retain a bit of texture. If you don’t have a food processor, combine with a fork, then scrunch with clean hands., On a flour-dusted surface, divide and shape the mixture into four equally sized patties (roughly 2cm thick).

Peel the garlic, then finely slice with the chillies. Scrub the sweet potatoes and chop into 3cm chunks., Place a large pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the chorizo, rosemary and thyme sprigs, and 2 bay leaves. Cook for 5 minutes, or until browned, then remove everything to a plate., Generously season the chicken with sea salt and black pepper, then place in the pan, skin side down. Turn the heat up to high and cook for 10 minutes, or until browned, turning occasionally. Remove to a plate., Add the chopped onion, celery, peppers, garlic and chillies to the pan with the cayenne and the remaining 2 bay leaves. Cook on a medium heat for 10 minutes, or until softened., Stir in the flour to coat, then sieve in 2 ladlefuls of the stock. Return the chicken and chorizo to the pan, along with the sweet potatoes and the tomatoes. Bring to the boil, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Cover and simmer for 40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender., Finely slice the Scotch bonnets (blanch them first in boiling water to reduce the heat, if you like). Bash the bay in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of salt, discarding the stalks. Muddle in a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and a splash of vinegar. Stir in the chopped chillies and set aside., Slice the okra and add to the gumbo pan for a further 10 minutes. Gently fold in the crabmeat and prawns for a final 5 minutes, or until cooked through.

Line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases or 15cm folded squares of greaseproof paper, then lightly wipe each one with oiled kitchen paper., Peel the sweet potatoes or squash and coarsely grate into a large bowl. Trim the spring onions, then finely slice with the chilli and add to the bowl, reserving half the chilli to one side., Crack in the eggs, add the cottage cheese and flour, then finely grate in most of the Parmesan and season with sea salt and black pepper. Mix until nicely combined., Evenly divide the muffin mixture between the cases.

Scrub the sweet potato clean, then chop it in half along with the squash (there’s no need to peel it)., Place all the veg on a roasting tray and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Roast for around 1 hour, or until all the veg is soft, then tip into a large jug., Add a good splash of boiling water, then blitz with a stick blender to your desired consistency. At this stage, remove a portion for your baby, if needed (you can freeze in ice-cube trays for another day)., Place the remaining blitzed veg into a pan add the stock, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Add the pastina or break in the spaghetti/linguine, then stir through the soup, adding a splash more water to loosen if the soup is quite thick because the pasta will absorb the water., Place on the hob for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked through., Serve with good grating of Parmesan cheese (not for your baby, and only a little for toddlers)."

with the seeds, then toast in the oven for 5 to 6 minutes., When the time's up, transfer to a food processor, along with the chestnut purée, suet and maple syrup, and blitz until the mixture comes together into a ball. It will be very sticky to begin with, so stop and scrape the sides as you go., Place a large sheet of baking parchment on a work surface and sit the dough on it. Then, with lots of gluten-free flour on your hands and rolling pin, roll out the dough as thinly as possible (less than 5mm)., If you’re making individual tartlets, oil and flour four 10cm loose-bottomed tart tins, then cut out the pastry to size. Or, roll out the dough and cut to the size of a large baking tin, then transfer to the tin using a fish slice., Prick the dough all over with a fork, cover with baking parchment, fill with baking beans or uncooked rice and bake blind for 12 to 15 minutes. Leave to cool completely in the baking tray, as it will be quite delicate straight from the oven. Keep the oven on., For the topping, chop the sweet potato into cubes, then place on a baking tray. Toss with a little oil, then bake for 25 minutes, or until soft., Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, slice and add the mushrooms along with 1 teaspoon of cracked black pepper, and sauté for 6 to 8 minutes, until the mushrooms brown., Blitz the roasted sweet potato in a food processor with the crème fraîche, nutmeg and ½ a tablespoon of cracked black pepper (or to taste) to a smooth, creamy consistency., To assemble the tart, crumble the blue cheese over the base, arrange the sautéed mushrooms on top, then finish with the sweet potato mix., Sprinkle with linseed, roughly chop and scatter over the pistachios followed by the sunflower seeds, then add a drizzle of rapeseed oil, and pop back in the oven for 6 to 7 minutes until it just starts to brown.

Drizzle over the BBQ sauce, season lightly and stir well., Pick and roughly chop the rosemary leaves, toss in a little oil and sprinkle over the top, then place in the oven for around 1 hour, or until bubbling, baked and gorgeous, adding a splash or two of water to loosen, if needed., Put the tray of sweet potatoes into the oven for the same amount of time, or until soft and cooked through., Around 20 minutes before the beans are ready, tear the bread into rough chunks and toss with a drizzle of oil in a roasting tray., Grate over the Cheddar (if using), then place on the bottom shelf of the oven for around 15 minutes, or until crispy and golden, to make croutons., Remove everything from the oven, tear up or squidge open the potatoes, and serve with the beans, dollops of yoghurt and the homemade croutons to mop up that delicious sauce, with a simple green salad on the side."

Add the paprika and muddle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil., Score the pork all over in a criss-cross fashion with a clean Stanley knife at 1cm intervals, just going through the fat, not the meat. Rub with the bay oil, getting into all the scores., Peel and roughly chop the onions and sweet potato, peel and finely chop the garlic, halve the chillies, then place it all in a snug-fitting roasting tray or dish and sit the pork on top. Roast for 45 minutes., Take the tray out of the oven and remove the pork to a plate momentarily., Stir the vinegar and passata into the tray, half fill the empty passata jar with water, swirl it around and pour into the tray, then sit the pork back on top., Reduce the oven temperature to 170°C/325°F/gas 3 and roast for a further 1½ hours., Twenty minutes before the end, remove the pork from the oven and skim the fat from the surface into a small bowl., Strip in the rosemary leaves (discarding the stalks), toss to coat, then sprinkle over the pork belly and place back in the oven for the remaining time, or until the pork is golden and tender and the sauce is reduced (loosen with a splash of extra water at the end, if needed)., The crackling should have puffed up nicely, but, if it hasn’t (pork skin can sometimes be erratic), just pop it under a hot grill and watch it like a hawk until it’s perfect.

Tip in the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of a spoon, then stir well., Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and leave to tick away for 25 to 30 minutes, or until thickened and reduced – keep an eye on it, and add a splash of water to loosen, if needed., Stir the roasted sweet potato through the chilli with most of the coriander leaves, then taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed., Finish with a squeeze of lime or lemon juice or a swig of vinegar, to taste, then scatter over the remaining coriander.

Cover with the lid and allow to heat up like an outdoor oven – you want a temperature of around 175°C/345°F., Scrub the sweet potatoes clean, then rub all over with a drizzle of oil and a good pinch of sea salt. Place on the middle of the barbecue, cover with the lid and bake for around 1 hour, or until soft in the middle and crisp on the outside., Meanwhile, fry the bacon (if using) in a pan over a high heat (you can do this on the hob), or until golden and crisp, then set aside for later., Split the potatoes open, crumble in the bacon (if using) and grate over the cheese. Return to the indirect heat on the barbecue for a further 5 to 10 minutes with the lid on, or until the cheese has melted., Trim and finely slice the spring onions and chilli then sprinkle over the potatoes, serve with spoonfuls of soured cream and devour."

Place a large ovenproof casserole pan on a medium heat., Finely slice the pancetta, pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves, then place both in the pan with 1 tablespoon of oil and the bay leaves. Stir regularly for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, followed by the onion and leek. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, chop the squash or sweet potato (wash first) into bite-sized chunks, leaving the skin on and discarding any squash seeds., I like to cut the stalk and face off the mushrooms because it looks nice – just add the trimmings straight to the pan, along with the whole mushrooms and chopped squash or sweet potato., Remove and discard the chicken skin and add the chicken to the pan. Pour in the wine and let it reduce slightly, then add the tomatoes and break them up with a wooden spoon., Half-fill each tin with water, swirl about, pour into the pan and mix it all together. Destone the olives, then poke them into the stew., Bring to a gentle simmer, then transfer to the oven to cook for 1 hour, or until thick, delicious, the chicken falls off the bone and the squash or sweet potato is lovely and tender., Season to perfection, then serve with bread to mop up that tasty sauce."
