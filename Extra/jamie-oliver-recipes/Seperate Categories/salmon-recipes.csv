Spread the potatoes back into a single layer and cook for another 10 minutes., Meanwhile, place the salmon fillets in the bowl, drizzle with ½ a tablespoon of oil and season with a small pinch of salt and pepper. Snap the woody ends off the asparagus and slice each stalk into three bite-sized pieces. Place in the bowl with the salmon and toss in the oil to coat., Once the time’s up on the potatoes, lay the salmon fillets on top, then carefully slice two thin rounds of lemon and arrange on top of each fillet. Scatter the asparagus around the salmon and cook at 190°C for 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through., Use a fish slice to transfer the salmon to serving plates, then divide up the crispy potatoes and asparagus. Delicious with a seasonal green salad and a dollop of pesto on the side."

Dry fry for 5 minutes, or until lightly golden, while you peel and roughly chop the onions. Add the onions to the pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until soft and sweet., Pour in the whisky, tilt the pan to carefully flame, or light with a long match (watch your eyebrows!), and, once the flames subside, remove from the heat. Taste, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper and allow to cool, then finely chop with the parsley or wild garlic and set aside., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7 and place a large baking sheet inside to heat up., Place the crème fraîche in a bowl, season with salt and pepper, then finely grate in the cheese and zest of 1 lemon. Crack in 1 egg and beat until smooth., On a large sheet of flour-dusted greaseproof paper, roll out the pastry so it’s 10cm bigger than your salmon all the way round., Spoon the mushroom mixture onto the pastry base, spreading it out and leaving a 3cm border around the edges. Place the salmon in the middle, then roll up the sides of the pastry to create the crust, going right up to the salmon and pinching it at the corners to secure., Evenly spoon the crème fraîche mixture over the top of the exposed salmon, spreading it out to meet the pastry. Trim the asparagus and slice each stem in half lengthways, then line them up like little soldiers in the crème fraîche mixture, trimming to fit, if needed., Brush the exposed pastry with beaten egg, then carefully lift the greaseproof and salmon en croûte onto the preheated tray. Bake at the bottom of the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. Delicious served with a garden salad and lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Trim and finely slice the spring onions., Carefully cut the skin off the salmon and place it in a non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat to crisp up on both sides., Pat the Cajun seasoning all over the salmon fillets, then fry for 5 minutes, turning to get them golden on each of their sides. Once the skin is crispy, move it to sit on top of the salmon., Meanwhile, use tongs to toast the tortillas directly over the flame of your gas hob for 15 seconds, or use a hot pan., Sprinkle the mango, avocado and spring onions over the tortillas, then flake over the salmon and crack over the skin., Toss the tomatoes and the juice of 1 lime in the residual heat of the pan for 30 seconds, then spoon over the tortillas. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over."

grate them into a bowl. Finely grate in the lemon zest, then add the salt, sugar and vodka. Mix together well., Place the salmon in a large tray and cover with the beetroot cure, patting everything down to ensure all of the flesh is in contact with it, then cover tightly with cling film. Place a weight on top to help pack everything down, then chill in the fridge for 36 hours, or until the salmon is cured and firm to the touch., Carefully unwrap the fish and remove it from the curing mixture. Run it under a tap to wash away any excess, draining all the juices, then pat dry with kitchen paper., Pick and finely chop the dill, then scatter it over the salmon flesh. Tightly wrap in cling film once again, then weigh it down and pop it back in the fridge., To make the scones, preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Tip the yoghurt into a large mixing bowl., Use the empty yoghurt pot to measure out one pot each of rye flour and self-raising flour and add it to the yoghurt, along with the honey, 1 egg, bicarbonate of soda and a large pinch of sea salt. Stir with a fork until everything just comes together, then get in there with your hands and shape the dough into a ball. Dust a clean surface with flour and flatten the dough into a large disc, roughly 2.5cm thick., Grease a couple of large baking trays with oil. Stamp out 24 rounds with a 5cm crinkle cutter, dipping the cutter in flour if the dough starts to stick, and place them on the trays. Beat the remaining egg and use it to eggwash the scones, then sprinkle over the oats. Bake in the centre of the oven for 20–25 minutes, until puffed up and golden., Meanwhile, make the horseradish cream. Put the crème fraîche in a bowl and finely grate in the horseradish and lemon zest. Mix well and season to taste, squeezing in a little lemon juice if you like., To serve, use a long sharp knife to slice the salmon thinly at an angle, then dish it up with the warm scones and horseradish cream. Delicious with good quality butter, a little bunch of fresh cress, lemon wedges and a shot of Christmas-infused vodka (see tip below)."

Cut the chilli in half lengthways and add to the pan, then halve the lemon, dropping one half in the pan and reserving the other half for the fish. Cover with a lid and cook on a high heat for 12 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed all the liquid and fluffed up beautifully., For the cucumber pickle, use a fork to score the cucumber skin lengthways, then slice into rounds and place into a bowl with a generous pinch of salt. Drizzle over a little vinegar, add a few sprigs of coriander, then scrunch it all up with your hands and leave to steep., Put a non-stick pan on a medium-high heat. Add a little oil, then place the fish, skin-side down, pressing down with your fingers for 10 seconds to flatten the skin., Dollop the korma spice paste onto a plate, add a squeeze of lemon juice and give it a stir. Using the rosemary like a brush (or use a pastry brush), dip it in the paste, swirl it around, then paint it generously over the salmon flesh. Continue cooking for 5 minutes to help the skin crisp up, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for a further 5 minutes., Wipe the pan clean with kitchen paper, then flip the salmon over and cook for 1 minute more. Turn off the heat and leave in the pan for 5 minutes  – the residual heat will continue cooking the fish., Remove the chilli and lemon from the rice pan and tip the rice into a bowl. Finely slice the chilli and a little of the lemon zest, then scatter it over the rice., Place the salmon on a board, then roughly chop and scatter over the remaining coriander. Flake the fish with two forks and serve with the rice and cucumber pickle."

Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper and rub with a little oil., Lay 8 pieces (roughly an arm’s length each) of butcher’s string at 5cm intervals widthways across the tray, then place one salmon fillet on top, skin side down., Toast the almonds in a dry frying pan until golden, tossing regularly, then tip into a food processor. Peel, roughly chop and add the garlic, finely grate in the lemon zest, then tear in the ciabatta. Season with black pepper, then pulse until finely chopped. Carefully layer the crumbs over the salmon., Halve 1 lemon. Trim the fresh artichoke stalks 2cm from the base. Peel away the tough outer leaves until you reach the paler ones that are tender enough to eat, then trim the heads to 3cm, rubbing with the cut lemon as you go to prevent discoloration., Halve them, scoop out and discard the hairy chokes, then finely slice. Drain and roughly slice the jarred artichoke hearts, reserving the oil., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of artichoke oil into a large frying pan on a high heat and fry all the artichokes for 2 minutes. Pick and roughly chop the mint leaves, scatter into the pan, then remove from the heat., Spoon the artichoke mixture evenly over the breadcrumb layer, drizzle with 1 more tablespoon of artichoke oil, then lay the other salmon fillet on top, skin side up. Arrange the bacon on top in a criss-cross pattern, and sprinkle over the thyme sprigs., Tie the string up and around both fillets to secure the filling. Drizzle over a little extra artichoke oil and sprinkle any excess crumbs back over., Place in the middle of the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the bacon and salmon skin are golden and crisp., Rest for 10 minutes, then serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.

Place the salmon, flesh-side down, in the marinade and set aside., Slice the peel off the oranges and cut each one into four discs., Add a cup of cold water to the pan of boiling water, followed by the noodles (this will help them cook slower without going soggy). Cook until al dente, about 7 minutes, adding the beans for the last 5 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water, then leave to one side., Heat your grill to medium–high. Remove the salmon from its marinade and place skin-side down on a tinfoil-lined baking dish. Grill for 4 to 5 minutes, until crisp at the edges., Toast the sesame seeds over a medium heat for 1 minute, or just until you can begin to smell them. Remove from the heat and set to one side., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the shallots for the dressing., Finely grate the zest of the yuzu or grapefruit, then cut in half. Add three tablespoons of juice to a bowl with the chopped shallot and zest., Peel and finely grate the ginger, then add about 1 tablespoon to the bowl of dressing., Finely grate in the zest of the lime and orange, then squeeze in the juice of both. Mix the dressing together well, loosening with a splash of water, if necessary., Arrange the beans and noodles on four plates. Top with the salmon, orange slices and the dressing. Slice the chilli and sprinkle it over the noodles along with the toasted sesame seeds."

heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and half the butter. Pick in the oregano leaves and cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly., Add the spinach and cook for a further 15 to 20 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated, still stirring regularly. Remove from the heat, taste, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper and allow to cool., Meanwhile, make the sauce: wash, trim and finely slice the leek, then place in a large pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, the remaining butter and the sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for 15 minutes, or until sweet and tender, stirring regularly., Pour in the wine and let it bubble and cook away, then stir in the flour and, splash by splash, stir in the milk. Leave it to simmer for 5 minutes, then liquidize in a blender until silky smooth., Grate in the cheese, add a pinch of cayenne and blitz again to combine. Taste and season to perfection, then leave to cool completely., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7 and place a large baking sheet inside to heat up., On a large sheet of flour-dusted greaseproof paper, roll out the pastry so it’s 10cm bigger than your salmon all the way round., Pour away any excess liquid from the cooled spinach mixture, then spoon it on to the middle of the pastry and spread it across the surface, leaving a 3cm border at the edges. Place the salmon in the middle, then roll up the sides of the pastry to create the crust, going right up to the salmon and pinching it at the corners to secure it in place., Lightly score the top of the salmon in a criss-cross fashion, then pour the cool cheesy sauce over the fish. Brush the exposed pastry with beaten egg, then carefully lift the greaseproof and salmon en croûte on to the preheated tray., Bake at the bottom of the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. This is delicious served with a garden salad and lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over."

Pop a weight on top to help pack everything down evenly, then put the whole thing into the fridge for 36 hours. Please use your instincts here – if you have a particularly chunky side of salmon you may want to leave it for up to 48 hours to allow for proper penetration., Once cured, unwrap the fish, then, holding the fillet in place, pour the juices down the sink and rub away all the salty topping (it’s messy, so you might want to wear gloves)., Pat the fillet dry with kitchen paper, then tightly wrap in clingfilm (sometimes I like to cover the salmon with freshly picked dill before wrapping, for bonus flavour). Put back into the fridge until needed, where it will keep happily for up to 2 weeks., To serve, use a long sharp knife to slice the salmon thinly at an angle and, as the knife touches the skin each time, kink it off, lifting away the salmon., Arrange the slices on a board or platter as you go. Delicious with a simple salad and good wholemeal sourdough, as part of a seafood platter, served up at a party or even as part of a festive brekkie spread."

oil, then put on a medium heat (starting from cold helps the fat to render out of the bacon)., Wash and trim 1 large carrot and 1 bunch of spring onions, chop into 1cm dice, and once the bacon is lightly golden, stir them into the tray. Finely slice and stir in the stalks from ½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley. Cook for 10 minutes, to soften, stirring regularly, then stir in 2 tablespoons of plain flour., Gradually pour in 600ml of semi-skimmed milk, bring up to a good simmer, then stir in 2 teaspoons English mustard and 400g of frozen chopped spinach. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the spinach has thawed., Chop 4 salmon fillets into bite-sized chunks, halve 200g of raw peeled prawns, finely chop the parsley leaves and stir it all through the sauce with 400g of frozen peas, then crumble 125g of feta over the top and turn the heat off., Meanwhile, wash 600g each of sweet potatoes and spuds (leaving the skins on for extra nutritional benefit) and chop into 3cm chunks. Cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until cooked through, then drain and mash well, taste, and season to perfection., Gently spoon the mash over the fish pie filling, spreading it out with a fork. Bake for 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp on top, and bubbling at the edges."

I’ve given you more pesto than you’ll need in this recipe, so toss some through cooked pasta or swipe some into a sarnie for tomorrow’s lunch.  ”",554,34.8g,5.9g,4.1g,0.8g,33.3g,28.5g,2.9g,"25g                                                                                                                                                                pine nuts, 50g                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil, half                                                                                                                                                                small clove                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemons, 15g                                                                                                                                                                Parmesan cheese, extra virgin olive oil, 150g                                                                                                                                                                 green beans, 1                                                                                                                                                                120g                                                                                                                                                                salmon fillets                                                                                                                                                                , skin on, scaled & pin-boned, from sustainable sources, olive oil, 300g                                                                                                                                                                new potatoes","Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Fill and boil the kettle., Place a frying pan over a medium heat and toast the pine nuts for 2 to 3 minutes, or until very lightly golden – keep them moving so they don’t burn. Tip into a bowl and set aside., Pick the basil leaves, discarding the stalks, and pound in a pestle and mortar. If you don’t have a pestle and mortar, very finely chop., Peel the garlic and add to the mortar with a pinch of sea salt and the toasted pine nuts – keep pounding until you have a green paste. Alternatively, very finely chop it all together on a large board, then place into a bowl., Squeeze in the juice from half a lemon and finely grate in the Parmesan., Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and muddle together – you need just enough oil to bind the pesto and get it to an oozy consistency., Trim the stalk-ends from the beans and cook in boiling salted water for 2 minutes, then drain., Fold just over half a metre of tin foil in half so you have a double layer., Place half the hot green beans in the middle of the foil., Lay a salmon fillet on top, skin-side down, and spoon over 1 tablespoon of the basil pesto., Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and season with sea salt and black pepper., Pull the foil edges together and scrunch them up to seal the parcel., Repeat steps 8 to 12 to make the remaining parcel, then place them onto a baking tray., Bake in the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and the beans are tender., While the salmon is cooking, refill and boil the kettle. Cut any larger potatoes in half, place in a small pan, just cover with boiling salted water and cook for 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain and return to the pan to keep warm until ready to serve up., When the time’s up on the salmon, remove the tray from the oven and leave to stand for 1 minute., Carefully open each parcel (mind out for the steam!) and cut into each salmon fillet to check they’re cooked, then slide onto the plate and serve with the cooked potatoes., Cut the remaining lemon into wedges and serve on the side for squeezing over."

Pick in the basil leaves and blitz until finely chopped., Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil–you need just enough to give it an oozy consistency – then finely grate and stir through the Parmesan. Give the mixture a final blitz, then halve the lemon and add a squeeze of juice to taste, then season with a pinch of black pepper., Scrub the potatoes, then trim the beans and broccoli. Cook the potatoes in a large pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until tender, adding the beans and the broccoli for the final 5 minutes., Meanwhile, heat a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Rub the salmon fillets all over with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place in the hot pan, skin-side down, turn the heat down to medium and cook for 4 minutes, or until the skin is golden and crisp., Turn the fillets over, then cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes, or until just cooked through. Remove the pan from the heat, rest for 30 seconds, then add a good squeeze of lemon juice and give the pan a shake., Drain the vegetables well, then tip into a large bowl. Add the pesto, then toss to coat., Divide the salmon and vegetables between plates, drizzle over the pan juices, then cut the remaining lemon into wedges for squeezing over."

roasting tin. Cover with cold water and place the fish kettle or tin over two hobs., Peel and roughly chop the onion and carrots, and trim the celery, then place in the water with the salmon. Add the bay leaves and the black and pink peppercorns, then cover with a lid or tin foil and bring to the boil., Once boiling, switch off the heat and allow the water and salmon to cool – it’ll take around 5 hours., To make the pickled red onions, peel and finely slice them, using a mandolin if you have one (use the guard!), then place in a small bowl. Add the red wine vinegar and a pinch of sea salt, scrunch together, then set aside to allow the onions to lightly pickle., To make the rhubarb sauce, trim the rhubarb and peel and core the apple, then chop into 2cm pieces., Place the fruit in a pan with the honey, bay and whole cloves, add a splash of vinegar and the orange juice, then bring to the boil and turn down to medium. Cover and leave to cook for about 30 minutes, or until the rhubarb has softened. Add a little extra honey to sweeten, if needed. Leave to cool., To make the mayonnaise, first make a tarragon oil. Pick the tarragon leaves into a blender, add 100ml of oil and blitz to a paste. Add the rest of the oil and blitz again, then strain through a piece of muslin into a jug., Place the egg yolks in a mixing bowl with the mustard and whisk well. Very slowly drip the tarragon oil into the egg yolk as you whisk; when you’ve added half of the oil, add 1 tablespoon of vinegar, then continue whisking in the oil (you might not need all of it). Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and black pepper., Carefully remove the salmon to a serving board and gently remove the skin. Break up the salmon flesh and arrange on a large platter, drizzling with a little oil, if you like., Pick the herb leaves over the onions and toss well., Serve the poached salmon with the pickled onions, rhubarb sauce and tarragon mayo on the side –  delicious with boiled new potatoes."

Check on it the next day, spooning any cure that has slipped off back over the salmon, then re-wrap it and place back in the fridge for one more night., On the third day, take the salmon out of the fridge and carefully unwrap it so you can rinse off the cure., Use a spoon to gently push the blackberry cure off the fish, then gently rinse off the residual cure with about 100ml of cold water, pouring a splash at a time over your salmon. Put the salmon to one side and rinse the tray under the tap., For the herb cure, pick and finely chop the dill and tarragon, then mix with the sloe gin in a bowl., Put the salmon back onto the clean tray, skin-side down, and pack the herby cure onto the fish using your hands. Make sure you cover all the flesh – you don’t want any air getting to it., Wrap it again with a double layer of greaseproof paper, then a tight layer of clingfilm. Pop the salmon back in the fridge overnight., The next day your salmon will be perfectly cured and ready to eat. You don’t need to rinse off the second cure – simply slice the salmon as finely as you can on an angle, so you get thin slices of gravlax tinged with pink and topped with herbs., Delicious served with slices of buttered sourdough, crispy crackers, slices of cucumber, sour cream, and some lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Lay the salmon skin-side down in the dish, spoon over the soy and honey and sprinkle with togarashi seasoning., Place under the grill to cook for 15 to 18 minutes until dark, sticky and the salmon flakes easily when prodded. Remove from the grill, squeeze over the lime juice, and set aside., In a small dry frying pan, fry the sesame seeds over a medium heat until just toasted, then set aside., To make the dressing, finely grate the lime zest into a large bowl, then squeeze in the juice from 1. Add the orange zest and juice, peel and grate in the ginger, then crush in the garlic. Whisk with the soy and oil until combined., Shred and add the seaweed and spring onion and toss to coat.

Mix well., Lightly knead, then place the soft dough on the floured surface and roll out to about ½cm thick., Divide the dough into 4 and shape into rounds., Allow to chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or until needed.
Meanwhile, finely grate the horseradish (if using fresh) and combine with the crème fraîche. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, pepper and a dash of extra virgin olive oil., Preheat a flat griddle or non-stick frying pan until very hot, then cook the potato cakes in a little olive oil for 4 to 5 minutes on each side until golden, crisp and hot all the way through., Serve with slices of smoked salmon – or poach the eggs to your liking (2 minutes for soft or 4 minutes for firm) – along with picked watercress leaves dressed with a squeeze of lemon and extra virgin olive oil and a side salad, if you like."

Season and set aside., Trim, halve and slice the leeks lengthways, then add the butter, oil, bay leaves and thyme to a wide, shallow saucepan, place over a medium-low heat and bring to a simmer. Add the leeks and cook for 10 minutes, turning, until golden., Pour in the stock and wine, cover with a large circle of baking paper and cook for 15 minutes or until leeks are tender. Remove the pan from the heat and rest the leeks in the liquid., Put the capers in a small saucepan and add enough olive oil to cover them by 2cm. Place it over a high heat and fry until the capers begin to open and crisp up. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the capers to a plate lined with kitchen paper., Heat a griddle pan over medium–high heat. Brush the ciabatta with olive oil and toast until golden, about 1 minute each side., To serve, spread the toasted ciabatta generously with the smoked salmon butter and top with the leeks, fried capers and pick over a few chervil leaves."

and finely slice 2 cloves of garlic and ½ a fresh red chilli (deseed if you like), then peel and finely grate a 2cm piece of ginger. Pick the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh coriander (15g) and finely slice the stalks., Scrape the skin of ¼ of a cucumber with a fork to create grooves, halve it lengthways, then scoop out and discard the seeds. Finely slice into half moons, then place in a bowl and squeeze over the juice of 1 lime. Drizzle over 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and toss together., Put 300g of new potatoes into a pan, cutting any larger potatoes in half, then cook in boiling salted water for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender., Trim and roughly chop 160g of green beans, adding them to the pan for the last 4 minutes. Drain and leave to steam dry., Meanwhile, cut open 1 green tea bag (if using) and sprinkle the tea onto a plate. Add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then roll the salmon in the mixture until completely covered., Place a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, scatter in 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds and toast until golden, then remove to a bowl., Place the pan back on the heat, drizzle in 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil, then add 1 x 225g salmon fillet, skin-side down. Fry for around 6 minutes, or until the skin is golden and crisp. Flip over and cook for roughly 5 more minutes, or until just cooked through in the middle – this will vary slightly depending on the thickness of your salmon, so use your instincts. Remove the salmon to a board, skin-side up, and leave to cool a little., Pop the frying pan back on a medium heat. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil, add the garlic, chilli, ginger and coriander stalks, then fry for a couple of minutes, or until lightly golden., Add the cooked veg, and using a potato masher, lightly crush the potatoes. Toss everything together, season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, then fry for a couple of minutes. Remove from the heat., Trim and finely slice 2 spring onions, stir them through the potatoes with the coriander leaves, then spoon onto a serving platter., Flake over the cooked salmon and sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds. Serve with the pickled cucumber and cut the remaining lime wedges for squeezing over."

Combine with the yoghurt, and season to taste., Using a speed-peeler, peel the cucumber into ribbons and place in a bowl. Peel and finely slice the shallots and chilli, then add to the bowl. Sprinkle over the vinegar, sugar and a pinch of salt, and mix with your hands to combine the flavours., Place a tortilla on each plate and flake over the salmon fillets, including any crispy skin. Add a dollop of the herby yoghurt, the minty cucumber (squeezing out any liquid) and pick over the reserved coriander leaves. Roll up and enjoy."

To make the spice cure, zest the orange, trim the chilli and peel the shallot. Blitz the orange zest, allspice, cinnamon, chilli, treacle and shallot in a food processor until you have a smooth paste., Transfer this to a bowl and stir in the rock salt and sugar. Pour in the 2 tablespoons of rum and mix well., Lay a large double layer of greaseproof paper over a baking tray and place the salmon on it, skin-side down. Slowly pour over the spice cure and use a spatula to spread it all over the salmon., Wrap the fish in both layers of the paper, then tightly in clingfilm. Place in the fridge with something heavy on top to weigh it down, then leave for 48 hours., When the time is up, take the salmon out of the fridge and carefully unwrap it. Rinse off the cure with the 50ml of rum (or you can use cold water), holding the salmon over a baking tray and pouring over a splash at a time. Use a spoon to gently push the cure off the fish. It should have shared its wonderful flavours with the salmon and turned it a dark brownish pink., For the herb cure, pick and finely chop all the herbs and mix together in a bowl., Clean the baking tray and cover with two layers of paper as before, then place the salmon on it, skin-side down. Using your hands, pack the herby cure onto the fish, covering all of the flesh – you don’t want air getting in., As before, wrap it with the two layers of greaseproof paper, then a tight layer of clingfilm. Pop it back in the fridge with weights on top and leave for another 24 hours., The next day, your salmon will be perfectly cured and ready to eat. You don’t need to rinse off that second cure – simply slice the salmon diagonally, as thinly as you like, then serve with pickled carrots, chillies, and buttered slices of bread."

Finely chop the chillies., Heat 2 tablespoons of peanut oil in a small saucepan, add the shallots and chilli and sauté over a low heat until very soft, about 10 minutes., Add the palm sugar and 20ml of water, increase the heat to high and bring it to the boil. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until caramelised.

Add the fish sauce and a the lime juice, then remove from the heat. Set aside until needed (you won’t need it all for this dish but the rest will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks)., Peel and finely slice the garlic, peel and finely grate the ginger, then halve the broccoli and Brussels lengthways., Heat 50ml of oil in a large frying pan or wok over a high heat, add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the broccoli and brussels sprouts and cook, stirring, for 8 minutes.

Stir in the fish sauce, put the lid on the pan and cook for 2 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender. Add the beansprouts and toss to combine. Divide between four serving plates., Wipe out the pan and return it to the heat, add a splash of oil and let it get nice and hot. In a bowl, whisk two eggs with a pinch of sea salt, pour them into the pan and swirl to coat it in a thin layer., Cook until the eggs are just set, then lay half of the salmon on top and roll up to enclose.

Meanwhile…, Finely chop the chives and add them to a mixing bowl., Drain the salmon in a sieve over the sink ., Add the salmon to the bowl, using a fork to flake it into small chunks., Once cooked, drain the potatoes and peas in a colander over the sink  then leave them to cool completely. Meanwhile…, Use a microplane to finely grate the lemon zest, then add it to the bowl along with the flour., Crack in the egg and season with a tiny pinch of pepper., Once cool, tip the potatoes and peas back into the pan and use a potato masher to mash them really well., Add the mash to the bowl, then mix together until really well combined., Sprinkle a little flour over a clean work surface and onto a large plate., Divide the mixture into 8 and use your hands to pat and shape each ball into a fishcake, roughly 2cm thick., Place them onto the floured plate, dusting your hands and the top of each fish cake lightly with flour as you go., Place a large frying pan on a medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil., Carefully place the fishcakes into the pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until crisp and golden, turning carefully with a fish slice., Cut the zested lemon into wedges., Serve the fishcakes with some seasonal green veg or a fresh green salad and lemon wedges for squeezing over."

lemon and the fennel into rounds and stuff into the salmon cavity with the parsley, marjoram and chives., Combine the rock salt, eggs and 250ml of water in a large bowl, then evenly spread one-third of the mixture over a large baking tray (35cm x 45cm)., Make a slight hollow in the middle to hold the salmon snugly, lay the salmon diagonally in the tray, then spoon over the remaining salt mixture, heaping it around and on to the salmon to create an even 2cm-thick layer all over the fish. Bake for 35 minutes., To test if the salmon is ready, push a skewer through the salt into the thickest part of the fish – if it comes out warm after 5 seconds, it’s done. Remove from the oven and set aside in the crust for just 1 hour., Meanwhile, make the basil yoghurt. Pick the basil leaves into a blender and add the mustard, the juice of 1 lemon and half the yoghurt. Blitz until smooth, then fold back through the rest of the yoghurt with 4 tablespoons of oil, and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., To make the salsa, deseed the chillies and very finely chop with the mint leaves and a drizzle of honey. Scrape into a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of oil and 2 teaspoons of vinegar, and season to perfection., Lightly crack the salt casing and pull it away from the salmon, brushing any excess from the top. Gently loosen and carefully transfer the fish to a large platter., Pull the skin away, then use a regular eating knife to scrape away any darker fish, leaving you with beautifully cooked pink salmon, which you can rustically remove in flakes and lobes., Serve with the basil yoghurt, salsa and lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Pick the dill leaves and reserve in a bowl of cold water in the fridge, then finely chop the stalks and stir into the mixture so well combined. Pop the salmon fillets into the bowl, turning them over in the marinade until well coated, then cover with cling film and place in the fridge for 5 hours., Meanwhile, make the horseradish sauce. Add the soured cream, grated horseradish and the juice from ½ a lemon to a small bowl. Mix well, season with a pinch of salt and add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, then place in the fridge until needed., Add the beetroot (including the juices) to a bowl with a splash of balsamic vinegar. Season well with salt, then mash with a fork to a rough paste. Have a taste and add a splash more vinegar if you think it needs it, then set aside until needed., After around 5 hours, remove the salmon from the bowl, then wipe off and discard any excess salt. Drain and finely chop the reserved dill leaves and rub all over the salmon. If you’re not serving straight away, sandwich the salmon together, with the skin-side outside and wrap in cling film, then return to the fridge, until needed., To serve, remove the cling film and peel away the salmon skin, then transfer to a board and finely slice. Snip over the cress, then serve alongside the horseradish sauce, balsamic beets, rye bread and lemon wedges for squeezing over. I sometimes like to serve it with a shot of vodka on the side too. Enjoy!"

Pick the coriander leaves, finely chopping the stalks, and deseed and slice the peppers., Put your largest roasting tray on the hob over a medium heat, and drizzle in 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the spices and curry leaves and fry for 2 minutes, then add the chopped veg, garlic and coriander stalks. Cook for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Place the salmon into the tray, skin-side down. Season with sea salt and black pepper, and drizzle lightly with oil. After 1 minute, carefully turn the salmon skin-side up, then place the tray in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the salmon is almost cooked through., Quarter the tomatoes, and run the tip of a knife down the backs of the prawns and pull out the vein, meaning they'll butterfly as they cook., Remove the tray from the oven and preheat the grill to full whack. Carefully peel the skin off the salmon and place onto a piece of tin foil., Stir the tomatoes, prawns and coconut milk into the tray, then finely grate over the zest from 1 lemon and squeeze over the juice. Gently simmer on the hob over a medium-low heat until the prawns are just cooked through., Place the salmon skin under the grill for 5 minutes, or until lovely and crisp, then leave to cool., Break the salmon into big chunks. Season the sauce to taste with salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, then snap up and scatter over the crispy salmon skin., Sprinkle over the coriander leaves and serve with lots of lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Place on a high heat and bring to the boil., Meanwhile, give the new potatoes a good scrub with a scrubber, then on a chopping board cut any bigger ones in half, leaving the smaller ones whole., Cut the tips from the runner beans until you cut into the stringy piece that runs the length of the bean. Pull the stringy bit and peel it down the length of the beans on both sides of each one, then slice at an angle into 5cm pieces., Trim the stalk-ends from the green and French beans, if using, but leave the wispy tips on, then slice the beans at an angle into 3cm pieces., Once boiling, carefully lower the potatoes into the water with a slotted spoon, bring back to the boil, then cook for around 10 to 12 minutes (depending on the size of your potatoes), or until they’re nearly done., Meanwhile, if your peas are still in their pods, pod them now., When the time’s up on the potatoes, carefully add all the beans to the pan and cook for a further 4 minutes., Drain the potatoes and beans over the sink into a colander and steam dry for a couple of minutes, then tip into a 25cm x 35cm roasting tray., Scatter over the peas, dot over the butter and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil., Use a microplane to finely grate the zest of both lemons onto a chopping board, then scatter into the tray., Cut the lemons in half. Squeeze the juice over the salmon and vegetables, using your fingers to catch any pips., Season lightly with salt and black pepper, then toss together while still warm so that the flavours are absorbed., Pick the basil leaves, discarding the stalks, then roughly chop them with the fennel tops or dill. Scatter half the herbs into the tray., Carefully score the salmon fillets lightly on the skin side. Rub each fillet with a little salt, pepper and olive oil, stuff the scores with the remaining herbs and place on top of the potatoes and beans, then wash your hands., Bake in the hot oven for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the exact size and thickness of your fillets, or until the salmon is cooked through and the vegetables are soft., Divide between your plates using a fish slice, then drizzle with the cooking juices from the bottom of the tray and serve."
Poached Egg & Smoked Salmon | Eggs Recipes | Jamie Oliver Recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/oldImages/large/952_1_1439206036.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",,"“Believe it or not, for many years poached eggs were just getting me every time. They were busting, or just generally not great ... It was really only once I started looking after chickens that I started to get the hang of making them. I think even as a chef I’d been taught to create a vortex in the water then pop the egg into the middle, but if you’re cooking for lots of people, that’s a pain. So this new way guarantees a perfectly poached pouch of egg every time. The exciting thing is that by simply tying the egg up in cling film with a few herbs you can flavour the eggs and have confidence they’re going to cook all right. ”",290,20g,7g,2g,1.3g,26g,2g,2.1g,"2                                                                                                                                                                knobs of                                                                                                                                                                butter, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemons, olive oil, dried chilli flakes, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    head of celery                                                                                                                                                                , plus inner yellow leaves, a few                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh tarragon, 4                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range eggs, 500                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                asparagus                                                                                                                                                                , woody ends snapped off, 8                                                                                                                                                                slices of                                                                                                                                                                smoked salmon (roughly 240g)","Half-fill a medium-large saucepan with water, season generously with salt and bring to the boil. Instead of putting a lid on, put a large bowl on top but don’t let it touch the water. Put the butter, a pinch of salt and pepper and the juice of 1 lemon into the bowl., This is going to sound cheffy, but it’s simple, so bear with me ... Tear off 8 sheets of good- quality cling film, each roughly 40cm square. Get yourself 4 teacups or small bowls and rub the rims with olive oil. Place a double layer of cling film on top of each one and carefully push it in so that it snugly lines the cups. Use your finger to lightly oil the inside – this will help your egg come out easily at the end. Put a tiny pinch of salt, pepper and chilli flakes into each cup then pick the celery and tarragon leaves and divide them between the cups too – try to help these flavours to spread up the sides, if you can., Carefully crack the egg into the cling film, then gently push the yolk down so the egg white surrounds it (without it breaking). Bring the cling film up into a bundle, then tie it in a knot and try to squeeze the knot down so it creates a perfect pouch and seals it (imagine a goldfish in a fairground plastic bag)., Once the water is boiling, remove the bowl (the butter should be melted now) and place your eggs in the water along with the asparagus. It takes between 5 and 6 minutes at a gentle simmer for a large egg. Place the bowl or a lid back on top and after 3 or 4 minutes remove the asparagus to the bowl of lemony butter and quickly toss., Meanwhile, arrange 2 pieces of smoked salmon on each plate. Pull out one of your eggs after 5 minutes and have a little feel (it should have a similar texture to fresh mozzarella). If it still seems undercooked, pop it back in for another minute or so., Neatly divide the asparagus between your plates. Cut off the cling film knots with a pair of scissors, peel away the rest, then carefully lift the eggs with a tablespoon and serve them right on top of your asparagus. If you‘ve done a good job, not only will you have perfect poached eggs, but the herbs and seasonings will have cooked into the egg and become one, like a stained glass window, which is really cute. Poke a knife into the egg to let the yolk run, and serve with wedges of lemon on the side."

Drain and mash well with a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, the zest from the lemon and the butter. Set aside., Peel and chop the carrots and onions, then fry them in a large ovenproof pan (roughly 30cm in diameter) with 1 tablespoon of oil over a medium heat for 15 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, heat the milk in a pan on a medium heat. Once simmering, add all the frozen fish fillets and cook for around 10 minutes, or until cooked through, then use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a plate, taking the pan off the heat., Stir the flour into the carrots and onions, then gradually add the warm milk, a ladleful at a time, stirring continuously until you have a smooth sauce. Stir in the spinach until thawed and incorporated, then season to perfection., Flake in the cooked fish fillets (carefully remove and discard any skin or bones), add the prawns and mustard, along with the juice of half the lemon, grate in the Cheddar, and stir gently to combine., Top with the pea-spiked mash and smooth out, scuffing it up slightly with a fork to give it texture that will crisp up. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until beautifully golden. Serve with a good old helping of baked beans (if you like). Delicious!"

Lay them over the base of the tray and season well with sea salt and black pepper. Cut the fennel into six wedges, scatter over the potatoes and give it all a generous drizzle of olive oil., Pick half the herb leaves onto a chopping board, .finely grate over the lemon zest, then roughly chop everything together. Scrape this mixture into a bowl., Using a sharp knife, make 6 slashes on each side of the fish, about 2cm deep and at an angle., Sprinkle salt and pepper into each incision,  stuff each with a pinch of the lemon-herb mix, then smooth flat. Drizzle the fish lightly with olive oil, then lay on top of the potatoes and fennel., Slice up one of the lemons, then stuff into the cavity with the remaining herbs., Bake the fish in the screaming hot oven for 15 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and cook for a further 30 minutes., To check if the fish is cooked, take a clean skewer and push it into the deepest part of the fish, just behind the head. Count to 10, then carefully take the skewer out and hold it against your top lip –if it’s nice and warm, the fish is cooked., Squeeze the juice from the remaining lemon over the top, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil.. Delicious served with a bowl of steamed seasonal greens."

It’s simple to serve and just as good cold as it is hot. If you’re not sure how to prepare the fish, get your fishmonger to do it for you. I’ve cooked it on a wooden plank in my outdoor wood-fired oven, but you can cook it in a large roasting tray in the oven., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Place the salmon fillets skin-side down in a large clean roasting tray – cut each in half if they don’t fit. Lay the rosemary on top and drizzle with olive oil. Gently rub the oil and rosemary all over the fish, and season. Bake for 20 minutes or until just cooked. (Alternatively, place on a clean smooth wooden plank and cook in an outdoor wood-fired oven for 20 minutes.), Meanwhile, mix the yoghurt and dill with the grated zest of the lemon, a few drops of juice and season. Cut portions of salmon off the skin and serve with the Italian farro salad."

Roasted fennel and potatoes are a magic combination, as are the fresh herbs and salmon. Scoring and stuffing the salmon is a great little trick you can use on any type of fish., Preheat your oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Halve the potatoes lengthways and trim the fennel bulb, reserving the leafy fronds for garnishing later. Cut the fennel bulb into eight wedges, add these to the salted water with the halved potatoes and parboil for around 6 minutes., Drain the vegetables in a colander and leave to steam-dry for a minute. Transfer to a large roasting tray and season well with salt and pepper. Sprinkle over half the chopped parsley and all of the garlic, dot over the butter and drizzle well with olive oil. Toss everything together in the roasting tray, then shake it out so it is in one even layer. Cook in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until golden., While the vegetables are roasting away in the oven, you can start preparing the salmon fillets. Pinch the fillets so they plump up and use the length of a knife to score the skin side of them. You want to score about 1cm down into them. Not only will this help all the lovely flavours get right into the fish, it will also help it cook more quickly. Season both sides of the fish well and stuff the remaining chopped parsley and the mint leaves into the scores. Mint goes brilliantly with oily fish, such as salmon., Once the potatoes are nice and golden, take them out of the oven and sprinkle the grated Parmesan over them. Give everything a bit of a jiggle, then lay the salmon, skin-side up, on top. Sprinkle the lemon zest over the top, drizzle with olive oil then cook for 15 minutes., Just before the salmon comes out of the oven, chop the reserved fennel fronds. Sprinkle them over the finished dish, then serve it in the middle of the table with some wedges of lemon and let everyone tuck in."

wedges","This recipe may sound like a lot of work, but curing your own salmon is much easier than you think. You do need to plan ahead, as the flavours need about two days to sink into the salmon properly, but it’s worth the wait., You’ll only spend about 20 minutes doing the actual curing, and you’ll end up with a delicate pink gravadlax which tastes impressive. Although curing is easy, it is important to follow the measurements, so try to get a side of salmon as close as possible to the weight I’ve suggested here. 

For the first cure, blitz the beetroots, orange and lemon zest, and bashed juniper berries in a food processor until you get a fairly smooth paste. Transfer this to a bowl and stir in the rock salt and sugar. Pour in the gin and give it a good mix., Lay the side of salmon skin-side down on a large baking tray and slowly pour over the beetroot cure. Use a spatula to spread it all over the salmon flesh. Once it is all well covered, wrap the salmon in a double layer of greaseproof paper then wrap it tightly with cling film and place it in the fridge for 24 hours., The next day, take the salmon out of the fridge and carefully unwrap it so you can rinse off the cure. Either use 100ml of cold water or gin. Hold the salmon over a baking tray and pour a splash at a time over your salmon. Use a spoon to gently push the beetroot cure off the fish. By now it should have shared its wonderful flavours with the fish and turned it a really vibrant colour. Put the rinsed salmon to one side and run the tray under the tap., For the second cure, mix together the chopped herbs, grated horseradish and gin. Put the salmon back into the clean tray, skin-side down, and pack the herby cure onto the salmon using your hands. Make sure you cover all the flesh – you don’t want any air getting to it. Wrap it again with a double layer of greaseproof paper, then a tight layer of cling film. Pop the salmon back in the fridge for another 24 hours., The next day your salmon will be perfectly cured and ready to eat. You don’t need to rinse off that second cure – simply slice the salmon as finely as you can on an angle so you get gorgeous thin slices of gravadlax tinged with pink and topped with herbs. Pile these onto a plate and serve with a couple of slices of buttered brown bread, and some watercress and wedges of lemon."

Meanwhile, cut the ciabatta in half lengthways, then cut into four equal-sized pieces, about 10–12cm/4–5 inches square., Place the sliced avocado in a bowl and squeeze over some lemon juice to stop it from discolouring. Using a speed peeler or potato peeler, slice the cucumber into long, thin strips on top of the avocado. Add the herbs and cress., Lightly toast the seeds in a dry pan on a medium to low heat, and place to one side to cool. Squeeze a tablespoon of juice out of the blood orange into a bowl, and add 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Season it well and give it a mix., Griddle your ciabatta squares in the griddle pan, charring both sides. Once they are nicely toasted, drizzle with a little of the dressing and put to one side. Place a square of ciabatta on each of four plates, then top each with a quarter of the smoked salmon., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the dressing over the salad and very gently mix with your fingertips. If you feel it needs more dressing, add a little extra, but try not to go overboard – you want it to be very light. Top the smoked salmon with the salad. Finish your delicious starter with a sprinkling of toasted seeds, using half a tablespoon per plate, and garnish with a wedge of blood orange."

Place the salmon onto a baking tray and sprinkle with salt and pepper then drizzle with a little olive oil and place in the hot oven for 8 to 10 minutes., While the salmon is in the oven, make the Marie Rose dressing. Mix the yoghurt and ketchup in a small bowl then add the zest and juice of one of the lemons. Season well with salt and pepper and add a dash of Tabasco for a bit of a kick. You want a loose, dressing-like consistency so you’re able to drizzle it over your salad. Taste and check it's to your liking. You can add more lemon and Tabasco if it needs a bit more flavour., After 8 to 10 minutes in the oven, the salmon should be just cooked, but still slightly pink and blushing in the middle. Take it out of the oven and put to one side to cool slightly. Meanwhile, get a large serving plate or platter. Roughly shred the little gems and mix together with the watercress, dress with a little extra virgin olive oil and scatter over the platter., Break the blushing salmon into nice big chunks and place them in and around the salad. Scatter over the cooked prawns, then spoon the Marie Rose dressing over everything. You can finish off the dish off by snipping over the salad cress. If you want to go for the old-school look, sprinkle a little paprika over the top. Serve with the remaining lemon (cut into wedges) and a glass of lovely cold white wine. Perfect!"

butternut squash into the soup is a little trick I saw in Sicily. It gives it good colour and sweetness., Finely chop the onion, celery, fennel, garlic and chilli. Heat the oil in a large pan, add the onion, celery, fennel, garlic and chilli and sweat gently until soft. Add the wine, tomatoes or passata, squash and stock and bring to the boil. Cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes. Season and gently break up the tomatoes., Roughly chop the salmon and halibut and add to the pan. Add the prawns or langoustine tails, cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until just cooked., Taste the soup and season it again with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, if necessary., Serve drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with the chopped parsley."

Gently place the salmon fillet in the tray, spoon over the marinade and then pop it in the fridge at least 90 minutes., To make the salsa, squeeze the juice from half the lemon and one of the limes into a bowl, and add twice as much oil. Deseed and very finely chop the pepper and chillies, then add to the bowl. Pick in the mint leaves and season well with sea salt and black pepper., Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Remove the salmon from the tray and discard the marinade. Drizzle with oil, then place it skin-side down on a large roasting tray., Bake for 12-15 minutes or until cooked to your liking. Flake the salmon and dollop over the  the red pepper salsa. Delicious served with some steamed rice and a leafy salad."

Top with waves of smoked salmon (a 300g pack is perfect here) Add a dollop of horseradish crème fraîche to each toast then snip over ½ a punnet of cress. Finish with a tiny drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a little squeeze of lemon juice. Delicious."

You can make them up the day before, keep them in the fridge wrapped in cling film, then slice them up at the last minute. They look great if you serve them up-ended, like sushi-rolls, on a rectangular or square plate with the dip in a little bowl. You could use mustard mayo or even horseradish sauce instead of the vinaigrette dip if you like., Crack the eggs in a mixing bowl, then add the flour to the bowl so it sits in a pile to one side of the eggs. Gently start mixing the eggs with a whisk, then gradually whisk the flour in, little by little, until it’s all incorporated. If it gets a bit thick, add some of the milk to loosen it up. Once all the flour is mixed in, add the rest of the milk, 2 tablespoons of oil and a good pinch of salt. Leave for at least an hour before using., Heat a large non-stick frying pan and melt a knob of butter in it. Pour in a ladleful of batter, swirl the pan around, then pour any loose batter back into the bowl it came from. You should be left with a thin pancake stuck to the pan. Let it cook for a minute or so, flip it over for 30 seconds and then slide it out on to a plate. Repeat until all your batter is used. (It should make about five, so you could use the remainder for breakfast). Let the pancakes cool., Make a rectangle of double thickness cling film about 40cm x 15cm and lay two pancakes on it side by side, slightly overlapping. Spread them with a thin layer of crème fraîche, lay most of the chives on top, season well with pepper and place a layer of smoked salmon over the top. Use the cling film on one of the long sides of the rectangle to roll the pancakes up tightly like a Swiss roll. Re-wrap in cling film and leave for at least half an hour in the fridge to firm up before slicing into inch lengths and serving with a dip made from the rest of the oil, the lemon juice and salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the remaining chives before serving."

Stir the eggs continuously with something flexible like a spatula to get right into the corners, and cook until little pieces of cooked egg are surrounded by soft, smooth and still quite runny egg. The egg will continue to cook even when the heat is turned off, so undercook them slightly and leave them in the pan while you butter your toast., Season the eggs with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste and pour over the toast., Quarter the lemon, then drape the salmon over the eggs and serve it with the lemon wedges. Add plenty of black pepper and serve immediately."

Put your muffins in the toaster, ready for action. Melt half the butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat until bubbling, then tip the eggs in. Stir continuously with a wooden spoon, getting right into the edges. Cook until the runny egg starts to thicken., Turn the heat off when the eggs are still slightly undercooked – they will keep on cooking in the warm pan while you're toasting and buttering your muffins. Stir the rest of the butter into the eggs. Place the buttered muffin halves on individual plates and cover each one with a spoonful of scrambled egg. Drape a slice of salmon over each muffin half, dollop some soured cream on top and sprinkle with chopped chives and a twist of black pepper., Serve with your lemon wedges and a nice cup of tea – or a glass of something fizzy., Tip: To make things easier, toast your muffins first and keep them warm in the oven."

Pop your naan breads into the oven to warm through. Halve, deseed and finely chop your chilli. Peel and halve your cucumber lengthways, then use a spoon to scoop out and discard the seeds. Roughly chop the cucumber and put most of it into a bowl. Halve your lemon and squeeze the juice from one half into the bowl. Add the yoghurt, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and half the chopped chilli.

Pick the coriander leaves and put to one side. Slice each salmon fillet across lengthways into three 1.5cm wide slices. Spoon the heaped tablespoon of tandoori paste into a small dish, then use a pastry brush or the back of a spoon to smear the tandoori paste all over each piece (don’t dip your pastry brush into the jar!). Heat a large frying pan over a high heat., Once hot, add a lug of olive oil, put the salmon into the pan and cook for about 1½ minutes on each side, until cooked through. Place a warmed naan bread on each plate. Top each one with a good dollop of cucumber yoghurt and 3 pieces of salmon. Scatter over a little of the reserved cucumber, chilli and coriander leaves and finish with a squeeze of lemon juice."

Put all the potatoes into a pan of boiling salted water. Boil for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are just cooked, and drain in a colander., Put the lemon zest and half the lemon juice into a bowl and add the vinegar. Normally, when making a dressing, I stick to one type of acid, but in this case using vinegar and lemon juice together gives the dish a lovely zinginess. Pour in three times as much olive oil as vinegar, and add the capers. Season the dressing with salt and pepper. Mix everything well, then add the warm potatoes and toss around until they are all well coated., Finely grate the horseradish into a bowl – be confident with the amount you use as you need the heat to go with the salmon and potatoes – and mix it into the crème fraîche with the remaining lemon juice and some salt and pepper. Sprinkle most of the dill or fennel over the cooked potatoes and toss again., Lay your smoked salmon out on a big plate or platter. Don’t be too neat – I want you to make it look rustic! Just pinch it up here and there so that it looks wavy and pile the dressed potatoes on top. Dollop over the horseradish crème fraîche, drizzle with some olive oil and sprinkle over the rest of the dill or fennel. Served with a glass of wine and some nice bread, this makes a delicious lunch."

Drain well and, when cool enough to handle, grate on the coarse side of a cheese grater into a mixing bowl. Add the spring onions, seasoning, flour and half the butter and mix well. Divide into 4 equal balls and pat into flat rounds. Leave covered in the fridge overnight if you can., Heat a non-stick frying pan over a moderate heat and add the rest of the butter. Gently fry the potato cakes, 2 at a time, for 2 to 3 minutes each side until light brown and heated through. Keep warm., Meanwhile, soft boil the eggs for 4 minutes – this recipe works best with runny yolks. Arrange a couple of potato cakes on each plate and top with smoked salmon. Shell the eggs and place on top. Spoon soured cream over the eggs and sprinkle over the chives. Season well."

Pound the rosemary in a pestle and mortar until you have a paste. Add the anchovy fillets and pound again until the paste is dark green. Now add the lemon juice, a couple of lugs of olive oil and some pepper, and mix together until you have a sauce with a good drizzling consistency., Get a large, ovenproof, non-stick frying pan hot. Pat the salmon fillets with a little olive oil, season them with salt and pepper and cook them in the pan, skin-side down, for 2 minutes. Flip them over, then place the pan in the preheated oven for another 3 to 4 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets and the way they’ve been sliced., Just after the salmon goes into the oven, put your broccoli into some boiling, salted water for 3 to 4 minutes until perfectly cooked., To check if the fish is cooked all the way through, you can pull the fillets apart a little bit and look inside. Salmon goes from being an orangey colour to an opaque pink, so that’s what you’re looking for. Please do not overcook them, because, as simple as this dish sounds, it’s your mission to ‘just’ cook the fish so you’re rewarded with a soft inside and a slightly crispy outside – heaven!, When the broccoli’s perfectly done, drain it, toss it in a little of the anchovy-rosemary sauce and divide it between your plates. Place a salmon fillet on top of each and drizzle with some more sauce."

and chopped, extra virgin olive oil","Get yourself a biscuit tin and place a handful or two of wood shavings into the tin, followed by your rosemary and sage sprigs. Place your wire rack in the tin, so it sits about halfway down, or bend some chicken wire to fit. Carefully pierce the lid of the tin five or six times with a screwdriver., Most salmon fillets come around the same size and thickness, so their cooking times are similar. Sprinkle the salmon fillets with salt and rub with a drizzle of olive oil. Then lay them skin side down on top of the wire (this acts like a grill rack) and put the lid on the tin., Place it on the hob, over a medium heat, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. After a couple of minutes it will start to smoke a bit., While the fish is cooking, mix all the salsa ingredients together – you can go as light or as heavy on the chillies as you like. When the fish is ready, turn the heat off and leave it to sit for 3 minutes before opening the tin. This will allow any residual smoke and heat to penetrate the fish., Lift the salmon fillets out and place on to individual serving plates. Spoon over some chilli salsa and sprinkle with your whole coriander leaves., Drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil and serve with the lime halves and the rest of the salsa in a little bowl. Lovely with some new potatoes and a green salad for lunch."

I didn’t grow up eating these, but they’re beautiful and so easy. A bit like bubble without the squeak. This was my first attempt at mastering them and it turned into this lovely breakfast, which I made in a pretty little flat in Glasgow’s West End. It’s the posh area of town and is full of beautiful shops and neighbourhoods. Well worth a visit.
This dish is the best brunch I can think of, besides maybe kedgeree. I never would have thought of putting this much flour with potatoes, but it works brilliantly. Give them a go with bangers, stews, on their own, or as part of this lovely brunch…I assure you this is one of the nicest ways to start the day, ever., Cut the potatoes into 2.5cm chunks and cook them in boiling salted water for around 7 minutes, or until tender. Drain them, allow them to cool, then return them to the empty pan and add the flour. Lightly mash everything together but try to avoid stirring it up too much. Finely slice the chives and add them to the potatoes with a knob of butter and the baking powder, then mash a few more times. (If you like, you can grate a little cheese into the mixture at this point – it’s delicious.) Season, then use your clean hands to bring the mixture together. Pinch off a little, taste and adjust the seasoning, then divide into 4 balls and dust with flour., Put a large frying pan (roughly 32cm) on a medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the potato balls (you may need to cook them in batches) and pat them down so they’re almost flat – 2cm thick is about right. Cook for around 10 minutes, turning them every few minutes until golden on both sides., Meanwhile, beat the eggs so they are broken and marbled. Season and put aside. When your potato scones are perfectly cooked, divide them between your plates, then take the pan off the heat and add a knob of butter. Once bubbling, pour in the eggs and put back on a low heat. Don’t be tempted to stir aggressively, use a rubber spatula to just sweep up the cooked layer of egg from the bottom of the pan every time it forms, so the uncooked egg can get down there and set. This will give you the nicest texture. The key to good scrambled egg is getting the perfect ratio of cooked silky egg and slightly less-cooked curds. To achieve that, you need to remove it from the heat once it looks three-quarters cooked – trust me. It will carry on cooking and by the time you mix it around one more time and serve, it will be gold., Arrange a piece of smoked salmon on top and add a pinch of watercress. Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil and serve with wedges of lemon for squeezing over."

It takes just minutes to put together yet it looks amazing on the plate which is always a bonus. It’s perfect for a quick lunch with friends., Using a speed peeler, shave the beetroot into a bowl. Add the lemon juice, a small pinch of salt and pepper, a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and a splash of balsamic vinegar then mix everything together.

Arrange the smoked salmon in waves over a large platter. Scatter over the watercress, followed by the beetroot slices, leaving any juices behind in the bowl. Finely grate the horseradish evenly over the beetroot then spoon the juices from the beetroot over the top. Sprinkle with an extra pinch of pepper then finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and let everyone tuck in. Serve with a lovely fresh loaf of granary bread on the side."

Stand a box grater in a deep baking tray or dish, then coarsely grate the carrot, along with the celery and Cheddar., Switch to the fine side of the grater, and grate in the lemon zest and chilli. Pick and finely chop the parsley (stalks and all), and add to the tray or dish., Slice the salmon and smoked haddock into bite-size chunks and add to the tray with the prawns., Squeeze over the lemon juice (no pips please!), drizzle lightly with olive oil and add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. If you want to add any spinach or tomatoes, roughly chop and add them now. Mix everything together really well., Drain the potatoes, and return them to the pan. Drizzle with a couple of good lugs of olive oil and add a pinch of salt and pepper, then mash until nice and smooth., Dot and spread the mash evenly over the top of the fish and grated veg., Bake in the oven for 40 minutes, or until cooked through, crispy and golden on top, then serve piping hot with tomato ketchup, baked beans, steamed veg or a lovely green salad."

Turn the heat down to medium-low and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the salmon and potatoes are both cooked through., Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley leaves, discarding the stalks., Once cooked, remove the fish from the colander to a plate, and discard the skin. Drain the potatoes, and leave to steam dry for 1 minute, then tip back into the pan., Mash the potatoes, spreading the mash round the sides of the pan to help it cool down quickly. When the potatoes are cooled, transfer to a bowl., Flake the salmon into the bowl, add 1 tablespoon of flour, the chopped parsley and a really good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Finely grate over the lemon zest, then mash and mix together really well., Dust a plate with a little flour. Divide the mixture into 4, then lightly shape and pat into circles about 2cm thick, dusting them with flour as you go. Put them onto a clean plate also dusted with a little flour. If you're going to freeze them, wrap them in clingfilm at this point and put them into the freezer. Otherwise simply pop them into the fridge for an hour before cooking – this will allow them to firm up slightly., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the fishcakes and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until crisp and golden – you may need to work in batches., Serve straight away, with veg or salad and lemon wedges for squeezing over."

In the markets and supermarkets these days you can get some fantastic spring vegetables: baby carrots with tops, baby fennel with its herby leaves, baby turnips, peas and broad beans, fine green and yellow French beans, all really colourful and easy to cook with. Here's a nice little combination – it's all cooked in the same pot and gives you a lovely broth. The only thing you have to do is control the cooking times by adding the veg that need longer in the pot first., First, make the aioli. When you've done that, bring your stock to the boil in a large pan then add your fennel and allow this to boil for 4 minutes while you heat up a non-stick frying pan. Take your salmon steaks and, if you fancy it, you could finely slice a little of your mint and basil and push this into the score marks. Pat the salmon steaks with a little olive oil, season and place skin-side down in the frying pan. Leave them for 2 minutes to get really crispy then check how they're doing. They'll want around 4 minutes on the skin side and 1 minute on the other. You'll get an idea of how they're cooking as you'll see the salmon change colour., When the fennel has had 4 minutes, add the green beans and the broad beans. Give them a further 2 minutes. By this time you will probably want to turn over the salmon steaks for their last minute. Add the peas to the other veg and cook for a final 2 minutes. Don't be tempted to overcook the salmon – remove it from the heat. Divide the vegetables between 4 bowls, rip over the mint and basil, ladle over some of your hot cooking stock and place the salmon on top. Serve with a dollop of aïoli. Fantastic!"

If your barbie is small, feel free to cut the salmon in half to make it more manageable., Place the salmon skin side down on a plastic board and, using a sharp knife, slash it evenly all over on the fleshy side, making the incisions about 1cm deep., Grate the lemon zest and most of the chopped fennel tops or basil over the salmon, then push these flavourings into the incisions – don’t hold back; really push them in!, Rub the fish lightly all over with olive oil then season with salt and pepper, giving the skin side a generous amount as most of this will fall off., When your barbie’s ready, lay the salmon on the bars, skin side down. The flesh will start to colour from the bottom up and after about 4 minutes the skin should be beautifully golden brown., Carefully flip the salmon over with a roasting fork or a spatula and cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes on the other side. While it’s cooking, gently ease the skin away from the fish and put it on the barbie alongside to crisp up.

If your salmon is wild it will have slightly less fat in it, so will be a drier fish. You can therefore cook it for a shorter amount of time, even leaving it slightly undercooked – although this might feel unusual to us Brits, who nuke fish beyond belief, this is a really good idea!, If it’s (organically) farmed, cook it through, but please don’t overcook it or it will become too dry. Lift the salmon carefully off the barbecue and place it on a nice serving platter or board. Allow to cool a little, then break the skin into pieces, a bit like poppadoms., Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, remove and discard the seeds, chop it up and mix it in a bowl with the yoghurt. Balance the flavours with the lemon juice, half the chopped chilli, and half the chopped mint or oregano., Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil. Season carefully to taste with salt and pepper., Break the salmon up with a fork into four to six chunks. Serve with the cucumber yoghurt, sprinkled with the rest of the chopped chilli and the remaining fennel tops or basil. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and make sure everyone gets a piece of the crunchy fish skin."

celery","Unclick and trim the romaine, radicchio, iceberg and chicory and spread them face up over a great big board to make receptacles for all the seafood., Put a griddle pan on a high heat., Halve, destone and peel the avocados (or use a spoon to scoop out the flesh), then cut into quarters. Dress with olive oil, sea salt and black pepper, then add to the hot griddle pan for around 4 minutes, turning as you go., Toast the bread in and around the avocado pieces, flipping when charred to make beautiful croutons., Scatter the prawns and shrimps in and around the little cups – try and treat all the cups in roughly the same way if you can, then wind and drape over pieces of the smoked salmon., Transfer the hot avocado to the board, clank it up and divide it between the cups. Roughly dice the toasts into 1cm pieces, then sprinkle over the board., Add the passata, mayo, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, celery salt, juice from 1 lemon and the horseradish to a blender along with a splash of whisky, brandy or vodka., Add a pinch of salt and pepper, followed by a lug of extra virgin olive oil, then whiz together. Have a taste, and adjust the seasoning, if needed., Pour the dressing in and around the cups and finish with a wodge of dill and some classic old-school cress ripped over., Remove the yellow celery leaves from the centre of the celery heart (saving the sticks for another day), slice up the root, then cut off the upper yellow celery leaves and sprinkle these all over too., Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, dot the platter with wedges of lemon, and you’re done. Serve any extra sauce in a little bowl on the side."
