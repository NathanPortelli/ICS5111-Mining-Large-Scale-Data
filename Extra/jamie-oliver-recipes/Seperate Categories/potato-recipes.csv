Festive greens gnocchi | Jamie Oliver Christmas recipes,With Gorgonzola & walnuts,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/154714710.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['a', 'side']",In40 minutes,"“Making your own gnocchi is such a nice, relaxing thing to do in the days between Christmas and New Year. These soft, light pillows have a totally different vibe to the shop-bought version, which can be great for convenience, but not what I want here. Coated in this vibrant green sauce, this is a brilliant way to get the kids eating green veg, too. Serve with crispy breadcrumbs and a milder cheese if you're feeding little ones. ”",581,30.3g,9.8g,3.4g,1.7g,23.1g,57.3g,3.6g,"800                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Maris Piper potatoes, 80                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                plain flour                                                                                                                                                                , plus extra for dusting, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    free-range egg, 6                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 400                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                cavolo nero, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Parmesan cheese, extra virgin olive oil, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                shelled unsalted walnut halves, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Gorgonzola cheese","Wash the potatoes, chop into 5cm chunks and cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until very tender., Drain the potatoes and steam dry for 2 minutes. Turn out onto a clean work surface, and pass through a potato ricer or coarse sieve, or simply mash with a potato masher., Add the flour and leave the potatoes to cool. Separate the egg and add the yolk, saving the white for tasty cooking another day. Season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., Knead on a flour-dusted surface for a few minutes until pliable, then divide into 4 equal pieces and roll each into a sausage about 2cm thick., Slice into 3cm lengths, then gently roll each piece down the back of a fork or a fine grater to add grooves, which will help your sauce to stick, or simply roll into balls., Fill the empty pan with boiling kettle water and place on a high heat. Peel the garlic cloves and place them whole into the pan of water with a pinch of sea salt., Strip the cavolo nero leaves from the stalks, add to the pan and cook for 4 minutes. Finely grate the Parmesan., Use tongs to transfer the cavolo nero and garlic cloves to a food processor. Add 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, a handful of grated Parmesan and blitz until smooth. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water and cook for 3 minutes, or until they float to the surface., Tip the sauce onto a large serving platter, sprinkle over some grated Parmesan, then use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked gnocchi and toss to coat. Add the remaining Parmesan., Crumble over the walnuts and Gorgonzola, and serve."

Potato croquettes | Jamie Oliver Cookbook Club recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/154384945.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '6']",,"“When I was 12, we lived in Italy for a year and at one point I had stomach flu and was laid up in bed for a few days. Obviously, during that time, I ate very little, because I had no interest in eating. But as I started to feel better and became more and more hungry, I craved only one thing – these potato croquettes. I don’t know why, but I couldn’t stop thinking about them. When I was finally healthy enough to get to the kitchen, I asked my mother if she would make some for me – and, being a great mother, she did. I devoured them.

Bring to a boil and cook until they are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes., Drain the potatoes and mash them in a bowl with a potato masher. Add the eggs, breadcrumbs, flour, cheese, parsley and salt to taste. Mix them with your hands to make a firm, dry mixture, adding more breadcrumbs or flour as necessary., Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan (about 20cm in diameter) set over a medium heat. Roll tablespoons of the dough between the palms of your hands to form logs 4-5cm long. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add a few croquettes to the pan and fry until lightly browned on all sides, about 6 minutes., Transfer the cooked croquettes to a plate lined with paper towels to drain before serving. Continue to cook the croquettes in small batches. Add more oil to the pan if necessary, being sure to allow it to heat up before adding the croquettes. The croquettes are best served immediately, but they can be made ahead of time and reheated in the oven if necessary."

Roughly chop the flesh and place in a mixing bowl., Once the spinach has defrosted, squeeze out the excess water, roughly chop and add to the mix. Crumble in the goat’s cheese and stir in the pesto., Halve the baked potatoes horizontally, then use a spoon to scoop out the fluffy insides into the bowl – leave around ½cm of potato around the edges so the baked potato keeps its shape. Mix together, gently mashing the potato as you go, then season to perfection. Spoon the mixture into the potato skins, then grate over a little Parmesan, if using., Return the stuffed potato skins back to the air fryer basket and cook at 180°C for a final 10 minutes, or until crispy and hot through., *Tested in a 4.2-litre air-fryer. All air-fryers are different, so results may vary."

Once all your potatoes are grated, drain off all the moisture using a clean tea towel or some muslin, if you have any. Peel and finely grate the onions into a bowl., In a dry pan over a medium heat, lightly toast the cumin seeds for around 3 minutes, until fragrant and beginning to brown. Grind them in a pestle and mortar., Place the grated potato in a mixing bowl, season with a pinch of salt and black pepper, and add the smoked paprika and ground cumin. Add the pork and the grated onions along with their juice. Add the chopped parsley and give it all a good mix (I like to mix it for at least 5 minutes, squeezing the mix through my fingers to make sure everything is evenly distributed). In Cyprus we just shape these into little torpedoes or small meatballs, it’s up to you., In a small frying pan, sweat down your finely diced onion really slowly in olive oil and with a good amount of salt for about 10 minutes, until soft and sweet but without any colour., Add the tinned beans, including any tinned liquid, along with the frozen spinach. Cook for a further 6 to 8 minutes, or until the spinach has thoroughly defrosted and the beans are cooked through. Remove from the heat, squeeze in the juice from the lemon and drizzle with olive oil. Keep warm until ready to serve., Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a large pan and fry the koftes for approximately 10 minutes, turning regularly until they’re a beautiful golden brown and the potatoes and pork are cooked through. Serve with the black-eyed beans and a drizzle of olive oil."

Taste and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, then use your hands to scrunch the flour with the potato., Knead on a flour-dusted surface for a few minutes until pliable, then divide into 4 equal pieces and roll each into a sausage about 2cm thick., Slice into 3cm lengths, then gently roll each piece down the back of a fork or a fine grater to add grooves, which will help your sauce to stick, or simply roll into balls., Fill a large pan with boiling kettle water and place on a high heat. Meanwhile, roughly slice the bacon and place in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat with a big pinch of black pepper and cook for 3 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Finely slice and stir in the garlic, cook for 1 minute, then add a splash of water and the frozen peas. Cook for 2 minutes, or until the peas are tender, using the potato masher to squash them slightly. Stir in the cream, remove from the heat and grate and mix in most of the cheese., Cook the gnocchi in the pan of boiling salted water for 2 to 3 minutes – as soon as they come up to the surface they’re ready.

Peel the potatoes, quarter lengthways, then cut across into 3mm slices. Place them in the pan with 150ml of olive oil., Peel and chop the onion to the same size as the potatoes and add to the pan with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Uncover and cook for 3 more minutes, or until lightly golden and the potatoes are just cooked through, then carefully drain it all in a colander. Return the pan to a medium-low heat., Crack the eggs into a large bowl and beat with a pinch of salt and pepper, then stir in the Get-ahead gravy leftovers and the drained veg. Pick and chop the rosemary or thyme (if using fresh) and stir in., Drizzle a little oil into the pan, then pour in the egg mixture. Cook for 8 minutes, then loosen the edges with a spatula., Put a plate over the pan, carefully and confidently flip the tortilla on to it, then slide it back into the pan to cook for 5 minutes on the other side. Transfer to a board, top with the watercress, and serve with a dollop of piccalilli, if you like."

There is even a play called Duck with Peas, and a copy of the script published with beautiful engravings by Thomas Crawshall. But blessed is the kitchen that has leftover duck to make this venerable hash, the supreme leftovers dish. Quantities are really at the cook’s discretion. Any shortfall in meat can be made up with eggs, bacon or vegetables, in this instance peas, perhaps adding a few pea shoots to the mix.

Finely chop the parsley (stalks and all), reserving half the leaves for later, then add to the bowl., Once nicely blackened all over, scrape away the pepper skin, remove the seeds and finely dice. Add to the tomatoes with ½ a tablespoon of red wine vinegar and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, then toss together and season to taste., Crack the eggs into a large bowl, add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then tip in the cooked potatoes and onions and stir gently for 1 minute., Pour the egg mixture back into the pan, pat it down gently with a spatula, then cover with a lid and cook on medium-low for 6 to 7 minutes, or until lightly golden and just set., Loosen the edges with a spatula, then carefully flip over – I like to tip it onto the pan lid or a large plate, then slide it back into the pan. Cook for a further 2 minutes, or until it has a little blush of colour., Turn out onto a serving board and top with the salsa. Dress the reserved parsley leaves in the last of salsa liquor, then scatter over. Delicious served with a fresh seasonal salad."

Crush 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds in a pestle and mortar. Scrub 2 small sweet potatoes and rub with the crushed cumin seeds. Place in a roasting tray and cook in the oven for 30 minutes., Meanwhile, trim the tough end off 1 broccoli stalk, slice it, then chop the rest into large florets. Toss the broccoli into the sweet potato tray with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Roast for another 30 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are cooked through., Toast 25g of cashew nuts and 25g of mixed pumpkin, sunflower and sesame seeds in a dry frying pan on a medium heat until smelling fantastic, then crush in the pestle and mortar., Bash and mush up 250g of vac-packed beetroot in their pack as much as you can, then snip the corner off and decant into a bowl with 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Mix together, mashing with a fork, if needed., Cook 300g of quinoa according to the packet instructions, and drain well. Pick and finely chop the leaves from 1 bunch of mint (reserving the pretty ones for garnish) and stir through the quinoa with the finely grated zest and the juice from 1 lemon, then season to perfection., Scatter the quinoa across a large platter. Once cool enough to handle, tear over chunks of roasted sweet potato and dot over the roasted broccoli. Halve 1 ripe avocado and use a teaspoon to add curls of flesh to the platter.

Mash and mix together well, then divide into 8 equal-sized balls and pat into flat rounds., Place the frying pan back on a medium-high heat, drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then add the patties and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp, then remove (and keep warm) while you fry 4 eggs to your liking., To serve, place two patties and a fried egg on each plate, then top each with a spoonful of salsa. Serve 1 x 80g bag of watercress, spinach & rocket on the side and toss with a little extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar, if you like."

Roast for 40 minutes, or until soft, golden and gnarly., Place a small pan on a medium heat with 1 teaspoon of olive oil., Peel and finely slice 2 cloves of garlic, then add to the pan along with ½ a teaspoon each of sweet smoked paprika and ground cumin. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes, then tip in 1 x 400g tin of black beans (juice and all), plus 1 tin’s worth of water and simmer for 5 minutes., Season to taste, then remove from the heat and blitz with a hand blender until smooth. Return to a low heat and leave to tick away., Meanwhile, cook 150g of long grain rice in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain., Place 200g of spinach in a colander above the rice and leave to wilt for a few minutes, then squeeze out any excess water., For the salsa, trim and finely slice 6 spring onions, then place in a bowl with the 100g of sliced pickled jalapeños and a splash of pickling juice. Pick in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh coriander (15g) and give everything a good mix., To assemble the burritos, load up the tortillas with the sweet potatoes, rice and spinach, wrap up, then slice in half. Pour the black bean sauce between 4 plates, and arrange the burritos on top. Serve each topped with some jalapeño salsa and 1 tablespoon of dairy-free yoghurt. Cut 1 to 2 limes into wedges for squeezing over."

To make this process as simple as possible, place a potato on a board between the handles of two wooden spoons, so that when you slice down into the potato the spoons stop the blade from going all the way through. Carefully slice at just under ½cm intervals all the way along. Repeat with all the potatoes, placing them in a large roasting tray as you go., Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, season with sea salt and black pepper, and roast for 1 hour, or until the potatoes are golden and tender. Remove and leave to cool., TO MAKE THE PIGS IN BLANKETS Twist each sausage in the middle so you can cut each one in half., Now, for a bit of fun, I like to use a small sharp knife to make an incision into each one, creating a little hole ready to stuff with whatever will elevate your sausages to an even higher level of joy., Cut the bacon rashers in half, then, working one at a time, press the side of your knife across each mini rasher to stretch it out. Place a sausage on each, wrap it up, then skewer with a cocktail stick or a sharpened sprig of rosemary., Nestle the wrapped sausages in among the cool potatoes, then cover and refrigerate overnight., TO SERVE Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5., Peel the garlic and pound up in a pestle and mortar with a small pinch of salt, then mix in the polenta and finely grate in the walnuts. Sprinkle over the potatoes, then drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil., When the Epic mixed roast comes out, roast the potatoes for 1 hour, or until hot and crisp, and the sausages are golden and cooked through."

Once hot, add the onions and a pinch of salt, then turn the heat down to low and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened., Meanwhile, scrub and very thinly slice the potatoes., Unroll the puff pastry and place on a large baking tray lined with baking paper. Use a sharp knife to score a border 2cm in from the edge, then prick the base all over with a fork., Brush with a little olive oil, then arrange the potato slices over the base, so they slightly overlap in one neat, even layer, leaving the border around the edge., Pick the rosemary leaves into the pan of onions and gently mix, then sprinkle over the potatoes., Dice the taleggio into small cubes and scatter over the potatoes and onions and season with a small pinch of salt and pepper. Melt the remaining butter and use to brush the edges of the pastry, then bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until bubbling and golden brown around the edges., Delicious served with wilted greens or a crisp salad."

Squash the onions and garlic out of their skins and toss through the potatoes. Serve with the chicken and green beans."

There’s no need to chop anything first, as now we’re going to mash it all up with a potato masher into a nice, flat, even layer., Season well with sea salt and black pepper, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until a lovely golden crust starts forming on the bottom., Now we get into the rhythm of the secret to good bubble & squeak. Use a fish slice to fold those lovely crispy bits back into the mash, then pat and flatten everything down again. Let it crisp up again, then repeat the process, and – importantly – keep repeating it over a period of about 20 minutes, until it’s golden, super- crispy and delicious. About halfway through, nick a bit, taste it, and correct the seasoning if you need to. When it’s looking good, you can serve it right away, or you can leave it on the lowest heat for a while – the flavour will only improve., You can serve this any which way you like – let’s be honest, it’s going to be amazing whatever you have it with. I like mine with fried eggs, a little lemon-dressed watercress and a few bombs of Piccalilli. Slices of leftover cooked ham are always going to go down a treat, too."

Prick and add the whole chillies. Halve the unpeeled garlic bulb across the middle and add to the tray with the harissa, paprika, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar and 1 tablespoon of olive oil., Use a large sharp knife to carefully cut down the back of the chicken, so you can open it out flat. Add to the tray and toss well, rubbing all that flavour into the bird., Place the chicken, breast side up, directly on the top bars of the oven with the tray of onions beneath it. Roast for 1 hour, or until the chicken is golden and cooked through., Scrub the potatoes, chop lengthways into chunky wedges, toss with 1 tablespoon of oil and a pinch of seasoning, then arrange in a single layer on your largest roasting tray and place in the oven below the onions., After 30 minutes, remove the onion tray from the oven, basting the chicken with any juices from the tray. Shake the wedges and move up to sit under the chicken for the remaining 30 minutes., For the sauce, halve and deseed the chillies, squeeze half the soft garlic flesh out of the skins, then blitz both in a blender with the onions and all the tasty juices from the tray, half the mint leaves and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar until smooth, adding a good splash of water, if needed, then season to perfection., Serve the chicken with the wedges and peri peri sauce, scattered with the rest of the mint leaves and roasted garlic."

Once golden, remove the sausages to a plate, put the leek and apple into the pan and strip in most of the thyme. Add a splash of water, season with sea salt and black pepper, then cover and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally., Drain the potatoes, mash with half the flour, then season to perfection. Lightly rub a 20cm x 28cm baking dish with oil. Once the mash is cool enough to handle, use your fingertips to spread two thirds of it evenly across the base and sides of the dish., Stir the remaining flour into the leeks, then gradually stir in the milk, then the mustard.

Peel and finely slice the garlic and add to the pan with the parsley stalks, fennel seeds, paprika and cumin, then cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly., Flick over the harissa and scrunch in the tomatoes, then stir in ¼ of a tin’s worth of water, pop the lid back on and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until the potatoes and squash are soft, stirring occasionally., Remove the lid, stir in the parsley leaves and season with a pinch of sea salt, then cook until the sauce has thickened and reduced., Make 4 wells with the back of a spoon, crack in the eggs, pop the lid on and cook the eggs to your liking. Nice served with warm flatbreads and extra harissa, if you like."

and sweet potatoes and chop into 2cm chunks, cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 10 minutes, or until tender, then drain and steam dry., Peel the garlic and ginger, finely chop with the chilli, and place in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat with the butter, garam masala and mustard seeds., After 1 minute, tip and mash in the potatoes, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Keep frying until crispy, then mix up and allow to get crispy again., Divide roughly into 4 (still in the pan), then use 2 spoons to crudely mould and shape into balls, patiently frying and turning until kind of rounded, really golden and crispy all over (trust me, these are amazing!)., Spoon the mango chutney into a bowl, squeeze in enough pomegranate juice to loosen, then mix together with a handful of the pomegranate seeds., Whiz the mint leaves in a blender with the yoghurt until smooth. Split the rolls open and lightly toast on the inside, and roughly crush the Bombay mix., Spoon a dollop of mint yoghurt on to each bun base, top with a hot potato ball, a little mango chutney and Bombay mix, then pop the lid on and squash."

Carefully slice at just under ½cm intervals all the way along, putting the veg into a large roasting tray as you go., Peel the garlic and place in a pestle and mortar, strip in the thyme leaves, then bash to a paste and muddle in 6 tablespoons of oil, the vinegar, and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Toss well with the veg, then roast for 1 hour, or until golden and caramelised, turning halfway., Remove all the veg to a board and place the tray over a medium heat on the hob. Pour in the wine and leave to bubble and cook away, scraping up all the sticky caramelised bits from the bottom of the tray., Tip in the lentils (juices and all) and spinach, then stir until the juices have thickened and the leaves have wilted., Season to taste with salt and pepper, ripple through the yoghurt, then present to the table with the board of veg.

blender, cover the porcini with 600ml of boiling water., Trim, wash and slice the leeks 2cm thick, then scrub the carrots, swede and celeriac and chop to roughly the same size., Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a large casserole pan on a medium heat, strip in the rosemary, fry for 1 minute to crisp up, then remove to a plate with a slotted spoon., Add the cumin seeds and prepped veg to the flavoured oil, season with sea salt and black pepper, and cook for 30 minutes, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the potatoes, cook in a pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until tender, then drain well. Mash with the butter and milk, and season to taste., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Quarter the onion, add to the porcini in the blender along with the Marmite and tomato purée and whiz until smooth., Pour into the veg pan and cook for 20 minutes, or until dark and caramelised, stirring regularly and scraping up any sticky bits from the bottom of the pan., Tip the lentils (juices and all) into the veg pan, bring to the boil, then season to taste., Spoon over the mash, place on a tray, bake for 30 minutes, or until lightly golden and bubbling at the edges, then sprinkle over the crispy rosemary. Serve with simple steamed seasonal greens – it’s a winner!"

differ for all of us. I’ve given you the recipe for the pigs in blankets and the batter, and everything else is based on what you’ve got – just don’t overload it., Start by moving your oven shelves around so you have plenty of space in the middle of the oven for your Yorkshire to grow., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7., For the Yorkshire, beat the eggs into the flour with a pinch of sea salt, then gradually whisk in the milk to give you a smooth batter, and pour into a jug., Wrap half a rasher of bacon around each sausage, poking in a sage leaf, too. Pop on to a baking tray with the potatoes (roughly chop, if you like), balls or pinches of stuffing, and the sprouts., Pick over the rosemary leaves and place in the top of the oven for 10 minutes., Pour the sunflower oil into a baking dish (25cm x 30cm) and place in the oven on the shelf underneath, to preheat the oil properly., Meanwhile, for the gravy, wash, trim and finely slice the leek, then put it into a frying pan on a medium heat with the butter or dripping. Cook for 10 minutes, or until soft, stirring occasionally., Shred in the turkey meat and stir in the flour and cranberry sauce, followed by the stock., Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thick, then taste and season to perfection., For the next bit, you need to be cool, calm and safe, as you’re working with hot oil, and you want to retain the heat from the oven., Have your jug of batter ready and two oven gloves or tea towels. Keep the tray of oil in the oven and carefully pull the shelf out a little.Holding it steady, pour in the batter, then gently transfer everything from the tray above into the centre., Push the shelf back in and keep the door shut for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the Yorkshire is puffed up and golden., Serve the Christmas toad in the hole with the dirty gravy, any extra cranberry sauce, and with a nice fresh slaw on the side."

This will only take a minute. When the spinach is done, remove from the colander and gently squeeze out any excess moisture., Drain the potatoes in the colander. Remove the eggs, cool under cold water, then peel and quarter them. Place to one side., Peel and finely chop the onion, then peel, halve and finely chop the carrot., In a separate pan, slowly fry the onion and carrot in a little oil for about 5 minutes, then add the double cream and bring just to the boil., Remove from the heat and finely grate in 2 good handfuls of cheese, then squeeze in the lemon juice and stir through the mustard., Pick and finely chop the parsley and stir into the cream mixture., Slice the fish into strips then place in an earthenware dish with the spinach and eggs and mix together, pouring over the creamy vegetable sauce., The cooked potatoes should be drained and mashed – add a bit of oil, sea salt, black pepper and a touch of nutmeg (if using). Spread on top of the fish. Don’t bother piping it to make it look pretty – it’s a homely hearty thing., Place in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden., Serve with some nice peas or greens, not forgetting your baked beans and tomato ketchup. Tacky but tasty, and that’s what I like."

Of course you can use the jarred stuff, which you can get creamed or preserved, but remember that you’ll probably have driven past a hundred jars of the stuff growing wild, on the way to the market! ”",449,25.9g,7.0g,3.9g,2.7g,22.3g,31.8g,4.4g,"800                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                new potatoes, 4                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                crème fraîche                                                                                                                                                                , or soured cream, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemons, extra virgin olive oil, 4                                                                                                                                                                heaped tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                fresh horseradish                                                                                                                                                                , or jarred horseradish, 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh flat-leaf parsley                                                                                                                                                                , (30g), ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh chives, 1                                                                                                                                                                small bunch of                                                                                                                                                                spring onions, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                hot-smoked trout                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources","Scrub the potatoes and cook them in boiling salted water until tender, then drain., While still warm, but cool enough to handle, either cut the potatoes in half or squash them into a large salad bowl., Add the crème fraîche, the zest and juice of 1 lemon and 4 tablespoons of oil. Toss around, then season to taste with sea salt and black pepper., Add or finely grate in the horseradish, tasting as you go, then finely chop the parsley and chives and throw these into the bowl., Trim, finely slice and add the spring onions, tear in the smoked trout, and mix together., Now it’s very important to balance your salad with more seasoning and maybe an extra squeeze of lemon juice. You may even want to give it more of a kick by adding some extra horseradish. Personally, I love to add a lot of horseradish and make it really hot., Great served as a starter, salad or even dinner if you love it as much as I do."

The classic pomme purée recipe uses an insane amount of butter, so I’ve tweaked the quantities to deliver a similar creamy finish only using less of it. Pure indulgence, but what a joy!

vinegar, extra virgin olive oil","For the rabbit, drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a large deep pan. Add the lardons and fry until golden and crispy. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside., Peel the shallots, then add to the pan with another tablespoon of olive oil and the mushrooms. Cook for a few minutes, or until lightly golden, then remove to a plate., Season the rabbit with sea salt and black pepper, then dust with the flour. Drizzle another tablespoon of olive oil into the pan, add the rabbit and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, turning until golden all over – you may need to do this in batches., Add the bay and thyme, then return the lardons, shallots and mushrooms to the pan with any juices. Pour in ¼ of the chicken stock and scrape up any flour from the bottom of the pan, stirring it into the liquid to get rid of any lumps. Stir in the remaining stock, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes., Remove the lid and leave to tick away for a further hour, or until the meat is falling away from the bone and the sauce has thickened., For the pomme purée, peel and dice the potatoes into 4cm cubes. Cook in a large pan of salted boiling water for 12 minutes, then drain and leave to steam dry., Heat the milk and cream in a small pan on a low-medium heat, until just below boiling point., Use a spatula to push the potato through a sieve into a bowl, then mix with the butter, warmed milk mixture and a little seasoning, until combined and creamy. You can also do this with a potato ricer or French mouli, if you have one., Trim the green beans and cook in a large pan of salted boiling water for 4-5 minutes, or until tender., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the shallot, garlic and tarragon. Dollop the mustard into a serving bowl with 3 tablespoons of vinegar. Gradually drizzle in 80ml extra virgin olive oil, whisking continuously until you have a thick dressing. Add the shallots, garlic and tarragon, then whisk again. Have a taste and season to perfection., Drain the beans and add to the dressing hot, tossing to coat., Bring the rabbit, pomme purée and dressed beans to the table and let everyone help themselves to a bit of everything.

Mexican-style steak | Jamie Oliver steak recipes,"Salsa, peanut sauce & crinkle-cut potatoes","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/85128277.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['leftover', 'sauces']",resting time,"“Here’s a meaty treat inspired by Mexico to get your taste buds fired up – a nice juicy steak served with a fresh, crunchy salsa and an addictively rich satay-style sauce. Ask your butcher to cut you a thick, double steak so you can get it gnarly on the outside and blushing on the inside. You can amplify tenderness and keep it juicy by turning it regularly, trapping the moisture inside while building up a bark-like crust. Peel off the fat and use it to render your potatoes for a deliciously retro side.

180°C/350°F/gas 4., Take your steak out of the fridge and let it come up to room temperature., For the salsa, pick and reserve a few coriander leaves, then roughly chop the rest (stalks and all). Pick and roughly chop the mint leaves. Peel the garlic, trim the chilli (deseed if you like) and spring onions, then roughly chop, along with the tomato. Mix with the herbs and continue chopping everything together until very fine., Squeeze the lime juice into a serving bowl with a good lug of of extra virgin olive oil and season with sea salt and black pepper. Add the chopped ingredients and toss to coat in the dressing. Set aside until needed., For the peanut sauce, put the nuts and the sesame and cumin seeds in a large dry frying pan over a medium heat. Peel and roughly slice the garlic and add to the pan, along with the thyme and oregano. Tear in the chipotle chilli and toast for a few minutes until lightly golden., Tip into a blender, just cover with water, then add the tequila, the juice of 1 lime, the fresh chilli, and a pinch each of sea salt and black pepper. Whiz until super-smooth, adding a splash more water if needed. Have a taste and adjust with more salt, chilli or lime juice. Set aside until needed., Scrub the potatoes and cut into 1cm-thick slices with a crinkle-cut knife. Pull the fat off the steak (discard the sinew) and finely slice. Place the fat in a cold non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and cook until golden. Add the potatoes and chillies and cook for 7 to 8 minutes on each side, or until golden and crispy. Tip the potatoes onto a plate lined with kitchen paper and keep warm in the preheated oven., Season the steak with salt and pepper, and place into the same pan as you cooked the potatoes, turning every minute until cooked to your liking – (about 7 minutes for medium rare). Remove from the pan, drizzle with a little oil and leave to rest for a few minutes, then slice 1cm thick., Spread a little peanut sauce over a large serving platter or divide between plates, and place the steak on top., Finish with a few dollops of salsa, a scattering of the reserved coriander, drizzle over any resting juices, then serve up with the crispy potatoes and tuck in."

the fresh ingredients, zest over the lemon (for the garlic butter) and mix with the butter (and spices for the curry butter) until combined. Roll the butter up into a log shape and twist the ends like a Christmas cracker. Chill in the freezer for 20 minutes, then remove, slice into 12 portions, reserving a few of the discs for your fish, and pop back in the freezer for another day., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Scrub the potatoes clean, cut into 2cm-thick chips and parboil in a large pan of boiling salted water for 6 minutes. Drain well and leave to steam dry in the colander., Tip into a large roasting tray, drizzle over 1 tablespoon of olive oil, add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then pick over the rosemary leaves and toss to coat. Arrange in a flat layer and roast for 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway through., Check the mussels and sort through the clams, giving any that aren’t tightly closed a tap. If they don’t close, discard them., Peel off the prawn shells, leaving the heads and tails on for bonus flavour, then run a knife down the back to butterfly them and remove the vein., Gently score the mullet and bream along the length of the fillet (going a little deeper if the fillet is fatter, and cutting to fit in the pan if very big)., Gently score the scallops on one side., Open up the squids like a book and use a table knife to score the insides in a criss-cross fashion. Separate the halves., Preheat your grill to full whack. Pop all the fish into a large skillet or ovenproof dish, halve the tomatoes and nestle into the gaps. Dot over your reserved flavoured butter, then cut the lemon into wedges and scatter into the pan. Grill for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the mussels and clams have opened up and everything is beautifully cooked., Serve the fish and tomatoes with the roasted chips, spooning over all those lovely buttery juices."

Rub the meat all over with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper, then toss., Heat a large frying pan, big enough to hold all the chicken pieces snugly in one layer, and put the chicken into the pan, skin side down. If you don’t have a pan that’s big enough, feel free to cook the chicken in two batches. Toss and fry over a low heat for 10 minutes, or until almost cooked, then remove with a slotted spoon to a large roasting tray or dish., Prick the tomatoes with a sharp knife. Place them in a bowl, cover with boiling water and leave for a minute or so. Drain and, when cool enough to handle, pinch off their skins. You don’t have to, but by doing this they will become lovely and sweet when cooked, and their intense flavours will infuse the potatoes., By now the potatoes will be cooked. Drain them in a colander, then lightly crush them by pushing down on them with your thumb., Pick and bash up most of the oregano leaves with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar, or a Flavour Shaker if you have one. Add 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, a good splash of red wine vinegar and some pepper and give everything another bash. Add to the chicken with the potatoes, the tomatoes and the rest of the oregano leaves. Toss everything together carefully., Spread out in a single layer in the roasting tray, and bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven until golden., Lovely served with a rocket salad dressed with some lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil, and a nice glass of white wine."

Tip into your pestle and mortar with the chillies, add 1 tablespoon of coconut cream and pound to a paste – put some welly into it!, Peel the lime zest, then finely chop the rind and pound with the chillies., Peel and finely slice the galangal, trim the lemongrass, discarding the tough outer layer, and finely chop. Peel the garlic, wash and chop the coriander roots or stalks, and peel and finely slice the shallots (setting aside a large handful of sliced shallots for later). Char your chopped ingredients in a hot wok over a high heat for 2 to 3 minutes., Add your charred ingredients to the paste mixture and continue to pound until smooth, adding 1-2 tablespoons more of coconut cream if needed. Alternatively, scrape the paste and charred ingredients into a liquidiser with a little extra coconut cream and pulse until smooth., Add the shrimp paste to the wok, fry it off for 1 minute, then bash or whiz with your curry paste until combined. (You now have enough paste for another 5 or 6 curries)., To make the curry, toast the peanuts in a dry wok for 3 to 4 minutes or until golden, then set aside., Roughly chop the meat into 4cm chunks., Put your wok back on a medium heat and add 75ml coconut cream and 2 heaped tablespoons of the curry paste. Give it a good stir and let it bubble away for a couple of minutes., Tip in the beef, peanuts and coconut milk, and bring to the boil., Reduce the heat to low, cover, and leave to tick away for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally., Peel and roughly chop the onion, then peel the potatoes and chop into 3cm chunks. Add to the wok, along with the fish sauce and palm sugar, then give everything a good stir. Cover and continue cooking for 25 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the potato is soft, adding a splash of boiling water to loosen, if necessary. Have a taste and season with a little more fish sauce, if needed., For the salad, trim the beans and steam with the bok choi for 3 minutes or until just cooked – you want the beans to be soft enough to bend, but with a little bite. Run under cold water and then cut into three and tie into knots. Shave the carrots into long ribbons with a speed peeler, then score the length of the cucumber with a fork and slice into rounds. Arrange on a platter with the beansprouts and fresh herbs., For the dressing, peel and finely chop the garlic and galangal, deseed and finely chop the chilli. Finely zest 1 lime, then roll and squeeze the juice of both into a small bowl. Add the garlic, galangal, chilli, fish sauce, vinegar and sugar, and whisk to combine. Pour over the salad just before serving., Cook the rice according to the packet instructions., Heat 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a pan over medium-high heat and fry the reserved shallots until golden and crispy.

While it rests, make the filling., Trim and quarter the radicchio, peel the onion and slice into eighths, then place in a small roasting tray. Pour over the balsamic and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, toss to coat, then strip over half the thyme leaves, reserving any pretty tips., Cover with a sheet of wet scrunched-up greaseproof paper and roast for 1 hour., Prick the potatoes and dry-roast in a separate tray alongside until cooked through, then remove. Once cool enough to handle, scoop the potatoes out of their skins and mash the insides in a bowl., Finely chop the radicchio and onion, then stir into the potato with 1 tablespoon of the balsamic juices from the tray. Finely grate in most of the Parmesan and all the fontina, mix well, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Leave to cool completely., On a clean flour-dusted surface, roll out the pasta dough so it’s 1mm thick and roughly 16cm wide (the width of a standard pasta machine)., Spoon heaped teaspoons of filling evenly down the pasta strips, slightly off centre, leaving a 5cm gap between each. Brush the exposed pasta lightly with water and fold the sheets in half over the filling., Gently seal around the filling, pushing out the air – you can cut them into 8cm circles with a pastry cutter or into squares with a knife. Place them on a semolina-dusted tray as you go – you’ll get about 18 ravioli in total., Toast the hazelnuts in a large frying pan on a medium heat until golden, then lightly bash and tip into a bowl., Cook the ravioli two portions at a time in a pan of boiling salted water for 3 to 4 minutes., Meanwhile, place the frying pan back on a low heat and add a splash of olive oil, a third of the butter, and a third of the remaining thyme leaves and tips. Fry until golden, then remove from the heat., Scoop the pasta straight into the buttery sauce, bringing some starchy cooking water with it, add a fine grating of Parmesan, toss gently, then spoon on to warmed plates., Finish each portion with a scattering of hazelnuts, a little extra virgin olive oil, some extra Parmesan and a few small drips of the balsamic juices, if you like. Serve up to your first lucky guests, while you crack on with the next two portions."

Mix together in a large bowl with the honey and vinegar, then squeeze in the lemon juice and finely grate over the zest. Add the chicken, 2 tablespoons of sea salt and 1 litre of water, and cover with clingfilm. Leave in the fridge for at least 2 to 8 hours, but preferably overnight., When ready to cook, take the chicken out of the fridge so it can come up to room temperature and preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Finely chop the bacon, then scrub and finely slice the potatoes and sweet potatoes. Peel and finely slice the onion and garlic, then pick and finely chop the sage leaves, discarding the stalks., Get yourself a wide casserole-type pan or a roasting tray and add the bacon, all the sliced veg, garlic and the sage. Add a lug of olive oil and a good pinch of salt and black pepper and toss everything together., Pour the chicken stock into the pan or tray, then put into the oven for 30 minutes so the potatoes can begin to soften and soak up the stock., Drain the chicken breasts, discarding the brine, and pat them dry with kitchen paper., Take the potatoes out of the oven and pour over the cream. Sprinkle over a little more black pepper and finely grate over the Parmesan, then use a spoon to make little nests in the vegetables for the pieces of chicken to sit in. Place the chicken in these nests and dot little knobs of butter on and around the breasts., Return the tray to the oven to cook for 35 minutes, or until the chicken is golden and cooked through and the potatoes are delicious. To check if your chicken is cooked through, simply stick a sharp knife into the thickest part. If the juices run clear, you’re laughing., Serve straight away with nice simple greens or a salad and enjoy."

They're beautiful fried simply with herbs and a pinch of salt, but even more exciting served in a spicy tomato 'bravas' sauce.

Drain in a colander and leave to steam dry until cool., Meanwhile, put a pan on a lowheat and start your bravas sauce. Add a lug of olive oil and, once hot, add the chopped onion and sliced garlic. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft but not coloured. Add the chillies, carrot and thyme leaves and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the tinned tomatoes, sherry vinegar and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the carrots are soft and the sauce is lovely and thick., While your sauce simmers, put a large frying pan on a medium heat and add 0.5cm of olive oil. Cut your potatoes into large bite-sized chunks. Once the oil is hot, carefully add your potatoes to the pan. Cook them for around 8 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden all over. You’ll need to do this in batches so you don’t overcrowd the pan. Add your garlic and rosemary leaves to the pan for the last minute of cooking., Transfer the potatoes, garlic and rosemary to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain, then scatter over the paprika, fennel seeds and a good pinch of salt and toss together until well coated., Carefully tip your cooked sauce into a blender, or use a hand blender, and whiz until lovely and smooth. Have a taste, and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Serve in a jug next to your potatoes or, if youwant to be more traditional, pour the sauce over your potatoes before serving and toss together like I've done here. If you have any leftover sauce, use it with pasta or on a homemade pizza."
Veggie bubble & squeak | Jamie Oliver vegetable recipes,"Crispy, gnarly, caramelised veg","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/91994145.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '8']",In40 minutes,"“Bubble and squeak is a dish created out of leftovers and it’s become one of our great British recipes. The first recorded recipes for it were written in the early 1800s, when any roasted shredded meat or vegetables left over from Sunday’s dinner would be fried in the pan the next day to create this big and beautiful veggie patty. But it’s so damn good you shouldn’t have to wait for leftovers to enjoy it, so I’m giving you this recipe as a guide. As long as you use 60% potato, you can make the rest up using whatever you’ve got to hand – vegetables, crumbled chestnuts, herbs, crispy bacon or leftover meat. In the cockney cafés they call this ‘bubble’, and serve it alongside eggs for breakfast. Because it often sits in the pan for ages getting dark and crispy, it tends to take on a fairly dark grey and rather ugly colour, but ironically, those are often the tastiest bubble and squeaks of all. ”",179,6.1g,2.9g,4.5g,0.3g,3.8g,29.1g,4.1g,"1                                                                                                                                                                kg                                                                                                                                                                fluffy potatoes                                                                                                                                                                , such as Maris Piper, 600                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                mixed vegetables                                                                                                                                                                , such as carrots, swede, turnips, parsnips, kale, Brussels sprouts... anything you like!, 40                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter, olive oil, a few                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh herbs                                                                                                                                                                , such as rosemary, sage, thyme or whatever you have knocking about in the fridge","Peel and trim all the vegetables, cutting the root veg into 2.5cm dice., Cook the veg in a large pan of boiling salted water for 10 minutes, or until they are all cooked through., If you’re using swede or turnips, put them in about 5 minutes earlier than everything else as they take slightly longer to soften up. If using kale, just blanch this for a few minutes right at the end., Once all the veg is cooked, drain and leave to steam dry for a few minutes., Melt the butter and a lug of oil in a medium non-stick frying pan (roughly Put a medium non-stick frying pan (roughly 26cm–28cm) over a medium heat., Pick and chop the herb leaves, then add to the pan with the cooked vegetables. Season well with sea salt and white pepper, then mash everything up in the pan., Pat everything into a flat layer and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until a lovely golden crust starts forming underneath. Fold those crispy bits back into the mash, then pat and flatten down and repeat the process for about 15 or 20 minutes. Concentrate on building up flavours, character and crispiness., Halfway through the cooking, flip it over using a fish slice, or like a pancake if you’re brave. If it breaks don’t worry, just push it back together., Let it crisp up on the underside then nick a bit and taste it. This is the time to correct the seasoning. Once you’re happy, serve it with a blob of HP sauce and whatever else you fancy."
