Cook for a further 10 minutes, or until starting to soften., Add 1 teaspoon of English mustard, 1 teaspoon of mint sauce and 1 heaped tablespoon of plain flour, stir over the heat for 2 minutes, then pour in 250ml of red wine and let it bubble and cook away., Pour in 1 litre of beef stock, then turn the heat down to low and simmer for 1 hour, or until the lamb is beautifully tender and the sauce is thick and glossy. Leave to cool completely., To make the pastry, sieve 350g of self-raising flour into a large bowl from a height. Chop 175g of cold butter into cubes, then, using your fingertips, gently work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Mix in 150ml of cold water and bring everything together into a dough. Leave to rest in the fridge for at least 10 minutes., Heavily grease a 1.5 litre pudding bowl with butter., Reserving a quarter for the top, roll the pastry out to 1cm-thick and cut out a circle large enough to line the entire pudding bowl, with a 2cm overhang., Strain the lamb stew through a sieve over a clean pan to catch the liquid, gently pressing to help it along, and reserve for your gravy. Tip the pie filling into the pastry-lined bowl., Roll out the remaining pastry and use it to top the pie, then use water and your fingertips to pinch and seal the edges together well., Cover in a large piece of buttered greaseproof and a double layer of tin foil. Tie a double layer of string just beneath the lip of the bowl to make it watertight, then tie another piece across the top to make a handle., Sit the pudding in a large deep pan and pour in enough water to come halfway up the sides. Bring the water to the boil, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and reduce to a simmer for 3 hours. Check the water regularly, and keep topping it up with boiling water, if needed., When the time’s up, lift out the pudding, remove the foil and paper, then carefully turn out onto a plate. Warm through the reserved gravy, then serve with some simple steamed greens."

Be forewarned, though: there will be a fair amount of smoke while cooking these, so they are best grilled outside. We use tahini in a few different versions of BBQ sauce, as the sesame paste lends itself so well to roasted meats, adding a rich nutty note. Here we include anchovies for a savoury touch and pomegranate molasses for sweetness. 

The accompanying plum sauce is like a chutney or Chinese plum sauce, with its sweet, sour and spicy flavours. It partners perfectly with these rich BBQ chops, and also works amazingly with a simple roast chicken or duck. The BBQ and plum sauces can either be made shortly before grilling the chops, or up to a couple of days in advance.  ”",,,,,,,,,"2

You may need to add a little more water to reach the desired custard- like consistency, depending on the variety of tahini. You can use the BBQ sauce straight away or keep it in the fridge for a day or two until needed., Put the plum wedges, sugar, garlic, spices, bay leaf and pomegranate molasses in a small frying pan, place over a high heat and bring to the boil. Cook for 5 minutes until the plums soften and start falling apart, then remove from the heat and stir in the salt and vinegar. You can use this straight away, or cool and store in the fridge for a few days., When you are ready to cook, brush half of the BBQ sauce over the chops, coating both sides. You will need the rest of the BBQ sauce to brush on the chops as they grill. Place the chops one by one on the rack above a hot BBQ. Grill for 2 minutes, then turn them over and brush with some more sauce. Grill for another 2 minutes before turning them back over and basting again. Repeat the grill-turn-baste process until the chops have cooked for a total of 6 minutes on each side. Remove to a serving platter with the baby chard spread over it., Pop the plum halves on the BBQ, cut-side down. Grill for a minute or so just to warm a little, then add to the platter with the chops. Serve with the plum sauce on the side."

Add a pinch of sea salt and mince it all with the back of your knife. Scrape into a bowl, then muddle in the Worcestershire sauce, mustard, 3 tablespoons of oil and a pinch of black pepper., Rub the marinade all over the lamb (avoiding the bones), then leave to marinate for at least 2 hours., To make the collard greens, put the chicken leg (if using) into a large pan with 1 litre of boiling water and simmer gently for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the meat is falling off the bone. Reserving the broth, remove the chicken leg, leave to cool slightly, then shred the meat, discarding any bones or wobbly bits., Wash the greens, then shred into rough 2cm pieces, discarding any stalks., Peel and roughly chop the onion, and peel and finely slice the garlic, then place in a large pan with 2 tablespoons of oil and the shredded meat (if using). Cook for 6 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly., Add the greens and cook for a further 6 minutes, or until just wilted – you may need to work in batches. Pour over the stock (or use the equivalent volume of reserved broth), cover and simmer for a final 6 minutes, then season to perfection., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Place a large ovenproof frying pan over a high heat, then sear the lamb for 2 minutes, or until golden all over, turning regularly. Transfer to the oven and cook for 15 minutes, or until blushing pink on the inside and gnarly on the outside., Rest the lamb for 5 minutes, then slice into chops and plate up with the collard greens.

On the whole, lamb is good nearly all year round, and although early spring lamb is lovely and tender, in my opinion it’s at its best around May, when the meat of the spring lamb has had time to develop flavour, character, texture and basically tastes like lamb should.

A leg of lamb should be soft to the touch and leave a slight indent when pressed. The skin should be dry, but not cracking or flaking. Ask your butcher to remove the bottom socket joint to make cooking and carving easier. ”",250,17.6g,6.2g,0.1g,1.0g,22.4g,0.5g,0.2g,"1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    leg of lamb                                                                                                                                                                , (about 2kg), 1                                                                                                                                                                handful of                                                                                                                                                                fresh sage, 1                                                                                                                                                                clove of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 1                                                                                                                                                                handful of                                                                                                                                                                 fresh rosemary, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, olive oil, 85                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                higher-welfare smoked pancetta","Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7., With a knife, follow the lamb bone down about 10–12cm (you are just making a ‘tunnel’ where you are cutting the meat away from the bone). Do this from the top end and the bottom end. Pierce the skin at an angle with a sharp pointed knife 6 or 8 times at random around the leg, then open up the incisions by poking your fingers down them to make a bit of space., Pick the sage leaves and peel and chop the garlic. Pick and roughly chop the rosemary leaves., Using a pestle and mortar, smash up half the sage with the garlic and 1 teaspoon of sea salt. When it’s pulped, squeeze in the lemon juice, add 2 tablespoons of oil, the other half of the sage and the rosemary., Stuff the herb mixture into all the incisions and gaps you have made with the knife., Slice the pancetta, then stuff deep into the gaps along the bone and the incisions. This gives a lovely fragrant flavour to the meat., Put a little oil in a hot roasting tray (preferably a nice thick one), add the lamb, and roast, turning every 30 minutes until cooked., COOKING TIMES
Pink – 10 minutes for every 450g plus 20 minutes
Medium – 13 minutes for every 450g plus 20 minutes
Well-done – 20 minutes for every 450g plus 20 minutes

black pepper in a spice grinder or blender until you have a powder. Peel and add the garlic, pour in the vinegar and vegetable oil, then blitz to a paste., Trim the excess fat from the lamb, then lightly slash the flesh all over with a sharp knife. Rub the spice paste all over, really getting into all the nooks and crannies, then marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight., When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6 and a griddle pan to high (or you can use the barbecue for added smokiness)., Sear the lamb for 20 minutes on the griddle, turning regularly to build up a gnarly crust, then place in a roasting tray. Drizzle with olive oil and pop into the oven for a further 20 minutes – these timings are for blushing pink, but feel free to adjust to your liking. Remove to a board to rest., Meanwhile, make the accompaniments. For the dressing, pick most of the mint leaves into a pestle and mortar, add a pinch of salt and bash to a paste. Muddle in the lime juice and yoghurt, then season to taste with black pepper., For the salsa, peel the pineapple and onion, then cut into wedges (removing the pineapple core). Blacken in a dry frying pan on a high heat, remove to a board, chop into rough 2cm chunks and scrape into a bowl., Squeeze over the lime juice, then finely chop and add the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves). Drizzle over 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and season to perfection., For the coconut rice, place a 24cm non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the mustard seeds. Pour in 2 mugs of rice and 3 mugs of boiling water and season with a pinch of salt. Halve the chillies lengthways and add to the pan with the creamed coconut., Bring to the boil, give it a stir, then cover and cook for 10 minutes on a low heat, followed by 5 minutes on a high heat – you’re aiming for a crispy bottom. Once cooked, carefully turn out, just like a sandcastle., Finely slice the remaining chilli(es), then scatter over the lamb with the reserved coriander and mint leaves. Take everything to the table, slice up the lamb and let everyone get stuck in. Delicious served with a seasonal salad."

white wine vinegar, extra virgin olive oil","Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Score a criss-cross pattern into any fat on the lamb, then cut into 2cm-thick slices., Peel the garlic and finely grate over the lamb with the zest of 1 lemon, then squeeze over its juice. Sprinkle over the oregano and season with a big pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Rub all over the meat, then cover and marinate in the fridge for 30 minutes., For the chips, scrub the potatoes and slice into 1.5cm-thick chips, then parboil in a pan of boiling salted water for 6 to 8 minutes. Drain in a colander, leave to steam dry for 2 minutes, then lightly shake the colander to chuff up the chip edges., Divide between two baking trays, then season from a height with salt, pepper and the dried oregano. Drizzle each tray with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and toss to coat. Roast in a single layer for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway., To make the flatbreads, mix the flour, yoghurt and a pinch of salt together into a dough. Knead on a clean flour-dusted surface for 1 minute to bring it all together, then roll into 8 balls. Cover with a damp cloth., Thread the lamb on to a long, sturdy metal skewer to make one epic kebab (or split between two, if you prefer)., Preheat a large griddle or barbecue to high, then cook the lamb for 15 minutes, or until dark and gnarly all over, turning regularly. Transfer to a large baking tray and roast in the oven for 5 minutes, or until just cooked through but still slightly blushing., For the salad, peel and coarsely grate the red onion with the tomato, cucumber and cabbage. Drizzle over the vinegar and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, season to perfection, then toss together., Roll the flatbreads out on a clean flour-dusted surface into ½cm-thick rounds. Reduce the heat under the griddle to medium and – in batches – cook the flatbreads for 1 minute each side, or until charred., To serve, shave the meat off the kebab, drizzling over any resting juices (see tip below). On a plate, drizzle the feta with a little extra virgin olive oil. Put the yoghurt into a bowl and sprinkle over the paprika. Cut the remaining lemons into wedges., Serve it all in the middle of the table and let your guests get stuck in!"

Sprinkle them into the pan with the thyme sprigs, and toss it all together for just 30 seconds to get the flavours going., Remove the chops to a plate to rest, then squeeze the juice from all 3 oranges into the pan.

Lamb & chickpea hand pies | Lamb recipes | Jamie magazine recipes,Turmeric pastry & Moroccan spices,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/50242466.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Makes', '15']",30 minutes,"“For a light, crumbly pastry, forget using a food processor – go old-school and use your hands. The addition of chickpea flour gives an extra crumbly-ness to this pastry and the turmeric adds a pop of colour and extra spice. You will need to make the filling in advance, so that it's cooled when you make your pies, otherwise the heat will soften the pastry. These pies can also be filled and refrigerated 24 hours before baking. ”",345,22g,10.6g,3g,1.08g,12.7g,25.7g,3.5g,"olive oil, 1

Peel and finely chop the onion and cook over a medium heat until soft but not coloured. Peel, crush and add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute., Add all of the spices and dried herbs to the pan, then cook for another 30 seconds until aromatic., Add the lamb mince and cook over a high heat until browned all over. Add the tomato purée, cook for 1 minute, then tip in the tinned tomatoes, stock and sugar, breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon., Season with sea salt and black pepper, stir to combine and cook over a medium-low heat for about 30 minutes, or until the lamb is tender, the sauce has thickened and almost all of the liquid has evaporated., Remove the pan from the heat. Pick and finely chop the mint leaves, then add along with the chickpeas and pine nuts, then season to taste and leave to cool., To make the pastry, sift both flours into a bowl, then add the turmeric and 3 teaspoons of salt. Dice the butter and rub into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs., Combine the vinegar with 180ml of iced water and make a well in the middle of the flour mixture. Add three-quarters of the vinegar water and mix with a knife until the dough starts to come together, adding the rest of the liquid, if needed., Very lightly knead the dough until smooth, flatten into a disc, wrap in clingfilm and chill for at least 20 minutes., Divide the pastry into 15 even pieces and roll out each one on a lightly floured work surface to a thickness of about 3mm. Cut the pastry into 12 to 13cm discs using a saucer or small bowl as a guide., Lay the pastry discs on a work surface and add a heaped tablespoon of the lamb mixture to each pasty. Brush the edges with water and fold the pastry over to make neat semi-circles. Pinch the edges together and crimp between your fingers., Arrange the pies on a baking tray. Beat the egg with the milk, then  brush over the top and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Brush the pasties with more egg wash, sprinkle with the za’tar and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pastry is cooked and the filling is hot through."

Tear in the bread, finely grate in half the nutmeg and blitz into a fine green crumb., Generously brush each lamb rack with mustard, then cover with the herby crumb, patting it all over the top and sides., Roast for 25 minutes, until the crust is crisp, to give you beautifully blushing lamb. Remove from the oven and leave the lamb to rest for 10 minutes., Meanwhile, trim just the stalk ends off the green beans and cook for 6 to 7 minutes in a pan of boiling salted water., Crush the remaining unpeeled clove of garlic through a garlic crusher into a jar and mix with 1 teaspoon of mustard, the vinegar, 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice, then taste and season to perfection., Finely chop and add the tarragon leaves. Drain the beans and toss with the dressing. Carve up the lamb and serve with the dressed green beans and my potato al forno."

water, then leave to soak for about 15 minutes., Mix the seven-spice ingredients together (it’ll make more than you need, but save the rest in an airtight jar for another day)., For the filling, finely chop the walnuts, destone and roughly chop the dates, and finely chop the top leafy half of the parsley., Place a large frying pan on a high heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil, the minced lamb, pine nuts and walnuts. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until starting to crisp up, stirring occasionally., Add 2 teaspoons of the seven-spice and the dried herbs, then cook for a further 5 minutes, or until dark golden and gnarly. Leave to cool, then stir through the chopped parsley., Drain the bulgur (if needed), and mix with the remaining kibbeh dough ingredients and a good pinch of sea salt until it comes together – this will become your outer layer., Divide the mixture into 16 balls (roughly 50g each). Place one ball on the palm of your hand, then press and flatten into an oval shape, roughly 7cm x 8cm. Place a good pinch of cooled filling into the centre, then mould the dough up and around the filling to seal., Repeat with the remaining ingredients, then place in the fridge to firm up for around 30 minutes. Now’s a good time to get on with making the Amba sauce and Houmous., When you’re ready to cook, just under half fill a large sturdy pan with oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go., Carefully lower one kibbeh into the pan – after 3½ to 4 minutes it should be golden and perfectly cooked through, so take it out of the pan and cut it in half to check your timings – once you know where you stand, you can cook the rest, in batches., Serve the kibbeh with the houmous and amba sauce. It’s also good with pickled veg, flatbreads and a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds and fresh herbs."

Chop the cheese into bite-sized pieces, trim and chop the aubergines into 2cm chunks, and trim and finely slice the lettuce., Finely crush the coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar and add to a large bowl with the oregano and garlic. Finely grate in the lemon zest (reserve the zested lemons) and stir in the oil., Season, then add the cheese, lamb, aubergines and bay leaves. Leave to marinate for at least an hour, or overnight if you can., Meanwhile, pickle your cabbage. Trim, core and finely slice the cabbage, then place in a colander in the sink or over a bowl and toss with 2 teaspoons of sea salt. Cover and set aside for at least 2 hours, then rinse. Peel and finely slice the onions, then transfer to a bowl along with the cabbage., Put the remaining ingredients in a pan and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10 minutes, then pour over the cabbage and onions. Transfer to sterilised jars – this will keep for up to 1 month., For the flatbreads, put the flour, baking powder, buttermilk and half of the sesame seeds in a bowl and mix until everything is combined., Tip onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Divide into six, using a rolling pin to roll them into 1 to 2mm rounds., Scatter with the remaining sesame seeds and run the rolling pin over them. Pop the flatbreads onto the hot barbecue for 1 to 2 minutes on each side., Load 12 skewers with the cheese, lamb, aubergines and bay leaves, then place on the barbecue (not directly over the coals) for 20 to 25 minutes, turning often, until the lamb is medium-rare and the aubergines are cooked., Serve the lamb with the flatbreads, cabbage, lettuce and lemon wedges."

Peel and roughly slice 4 red onions, then place in a deep roasting tray. Halve and add 1 bulb of garlic, then lay the lamb on top., Drizzle over a little oil, then pick, roughly chop and sprinkle over the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh rosemary. Finely grate over half of 1 whole nutmeg, add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper and rub all over the lamb., Drizzle over 200ml of balsamic vinegar, add a good splash of water to the tray and cover tightly with a double layer of tin foil., Cook in the oven for 5 hours, removing the foil for the final hour, until the meat is tender and almost falling off the bone and the outside is super-sticky and gnarly – add splashes of water, if needed, and baste with the pan juices occasionally., Place the lamb onto a serving platter, cover with tin foil and leave to rest while you make the gravy., Pick and roughly chop the leaves from 1 bunch of fresh mint. Skim away the fat from the top of the roasting tray and place on the hob over a medium heat. Whisk in 1 heaped tablespoon of plain flour, pour in 400ml of boiling water then add the mint and simmer gently for 10 minutes, or until thick and glossy, stirring regularly., Sieve the minty gravy into a jug and serve alongside the lamb with some potato and celeriac mash and steamed seasonal greens, if you like."

Add the yeast mix and 2 tablespoons of oil. Beat and pour in the eggs, and stir with a wooden spoon until a dough forms., Knead the dough on a lightly flour-dusted surface for 10 minutes, adding extra flour to the dough if it’s too sticky., Lightly grease the bowl with oil, then return the dough to the bowl. Cover with a cloth and leave in a warm place for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size., To make the lamb and cheese filling, peel and thinly slice the onion. Peel and finely chop the garlic, then trim and chop the spring onions. Cut the lamb into cubes., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan, add the onion, garlic and spring onions and sauté for 5 minutes, or until softened. Remove from the pan., Season the lamb and brown in the pan over a medium heat – you may need to do this in batches., Stir in the cinnamon, then return the onion mixture to the pan. Add the white wine and 100ml of water, and stir to pick up the crispy bits on the base. Simmer for 30 minutes, with a lid on for the first 5 minutes., Beat 1 egg in a bowl, then grate in the cheeses. Cook the spinach or chard in a large pan of boiling water, then drain and leave to cool., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4. Lightly grease a 23cm springform tart tin with a little oil., Divide the dough in half. Lightly flour a work surface and roll the first piece of dough into a circle, about 35cm wide., Carefully place it into the tin, lightly pressing into the base and sides, leaving about 3cm of pastry hanging over the rim., Spread half the lamb mixture over the base, followed by half the cheese mixture. Chop the cooled greens, then scatter half on top. Repeat with remaining ingredients., Roll out the second piece of dough and place over the filling., Trim the edges, but leave about 4cm of overhang, then roll it up and crimp the edges., Make a hole in the centre of the pastry lid. Beat the remaining egg and brush over the pie, then bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or till golden., Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Serve with a mixed green salad."

sauté for 10 minutes, or until soft and sticky., Add the lamb and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until lightly browned, stirring in the cumin, coriander and garlic for the last 2 minutes., Put the stock cube into the pan along with enough boiling water to just cover the meat. Bring to the boil, season and reduce to a simmer. Cover with a lid and cook for 1½ hours, or until the meat is tender (you should be able to cut the meat with a spoon)., Now remove the lid and boil away most of the cooking liquid, until you have a thick gravy, then stir in half of the parsley (saving the rest to serve) and season. Set aside., Meanwhile, start the rice. Place a large pan of salted water over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Wash the rice under cold running water until the water runs clear, then add it to the pan. Simmer for 6 to 7 minutes, until it’s almost cooked but the grains still have some bite., Drain in a colander and cool under cold running water. Allow the rice to drain completely., In a bowl, mix together the yoghurt, egg and lemon juice and season well. Set aside a quarter of the yoghurt mixture, then stir the rest of it into half of the cooked rice., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/gas 5., In a large, heavy-based iron pot or casserole dish, melt the butter over a medium heat, brushing some up the sides of the pan., Pack the yoghurty rice into the base of the pan in one layer, then spread the lamb on top in another even layer., Mix the remaining rice with the leftover yoghurt mix, then use it to top the lamb. Cover with the lid or a layer of well-sealed foil. Bake in the oven for 1 hour, then remove the lid and bake for a further 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until you can see a dark golden crust all around the edge of the rice., When your dish is cooked, lower the pot into a sink of cold water for 1 minute (being careful the water doesn’t get in), then run a knife around the inside. This will help release the rice from the pot., Working quickly, place a large platter or board on top of the pot and invert it, so the tah chin comes out. Don’t worry if it isn’t completely rigid – the bottom layer of rice will be softer, but you should have a crunchy golden crust on top. Serve your tah chin topped with the rest of the chopped parsley, pomegranate seeds, and some extra yoghurt on the side, if you like."

Otherwise, soak the wooden skewers in warm water for at least 20 minutes before using., Cut the lamb into 5cm pieces, peel and slice each onion into 6 wedges, then place in a large baking tray. Add the cherry tomatoes and mix with the marinade., Thread, alternating ingredients, onto the skewers, then refrigerate until ready to cook., Pick and finely chop the mint leaves and mix with the yoghurt, a pinch of salt and pepper, a squeeze of lemon juice and a splash of extra virgin olive oil., Preheat the barbecue, grill or griddle pan. Grill the kebabs, turning occasionally, for about 7 minutes, or until evenly cooked and crisp and golden on all sides., Serve with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and the minty yoghurt."

all over, ½cm apart and 3mm deep – this gives it the most amazing, gnarly, crispy surface and a blushing centre., Make the herby butter by putting the butter into a blender, pick in the thyme and rosemary, season well, then whiz to combine. Pop it into a bowl and set aside., Halve the unpeeled onions, separate and bash the unpeeled garlic cloves, then arrange in a large roasting tray., Spread the herby butter all over the lamb, then pop the meat on top of the veg. Roast in the oven for 10 minutes for every 450g, plus 20 minutes at the end, for blushing meat., Meanwhile, peel and chop the celeriac into 3cm chunks, and peel and chop the potatoes into 2cm chunks., Cook the celeriac and potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water for 15 to 20 minutes, or until soft. Drain, allow to steam dry, then mash with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil (or butter if you prefer), and season well with a little grated nutmeg and some sea salt and black pepper., When the lamb is cooked, allow it to rest for at least 10 minutes, while you make the gravy. Set aside half a red onion to make the mint sauce, then squash the rest of the onions into the tray., Stir in the flour, a lug of port and the stock, then place over a high heat to allow the gravy to reduce, stirring continuously. Pass through a sieve and keep hot until needed., Pick and finely chop the mint. Pop the reserved onion half out of its skin and finely chopping it with the mint, then mix them together in a bowl with the vinegar and sugar. Take everything to the table, and dig in!"

Blitz to a smooth paste and set aside., Roughly chop the tomatoes and blitz in the same blender with the tomato purée until you have a fine paste. Set aside., Peel and thinly slice the onions., Heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy-based pan over a medium heat. Add the green cardamom and cloves, letting them sizzle for a few seconds, then stir in the onions and fry for 14 to 15 minutes, or until dark brown in colour, stirring often., Mix in the ginger and garlic paste and fry for 1 minute, stirring well. Add a splash of water to loosen the mixture and scrape off the delicious bits from the bottom of the pan., Add the kashmiri chilli and turmeric powder and fry for 1 to 2 minutes, followed by the tomato mix. Stir well to combine and cook for 3 to 4 minutes., Add the lamb and cook for another 5 minutes, ensuring the meat gets coated in the masala., Slice the chilli lengthways, then stir into the pan with 150ml of water. Bring it to the boil and simmer, covered, over a low heat, for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally., Pour in another 150ml of water, pop the lid on and simmer for 40 minutes, or until the meat is tender, and the sauce has thickened into a rich, dark colour, stirring a few times and removing the lid for the final 20 minutes., Make the red onion salad. Peel, finely slice and toss the onion in a bowl, squeeze in the lime juice and season with a pinch of sea salt. Toss to combine and set aside., Finely chop the apricots, then add to a pan with the jaggery or sugar and vinegar. Cook for 1 minute over a medium heat, then turn off the heat., Coarsely grind the cumin, then add to the apricots along with the garam masala powder. Stir well, then add to the curry., Divide the parsi salli boti between serving bowls and serve with the red onion salad, lime wedges for squeezing over, and some basmati rice, if you like."

Using a sharp knife, carefully cut down the lamb leg to expose the bone., Keeping your knife as close to the bone as possible, cut along one edge to completely reveal it., Cut right around the bone, then remove it., Lay the lamb flat on a chopping board, skin-side down. With your knife, make an incision halfway into the flesh on each side, where the meat is thicker, then open it out like a book., You should now have a flat piece of lamb of more or less even thickness., Soak your dried chillies in a bowl of hot water for 10 minutes., Meanwhile, in a small frying pan over a medium heat, dry-toast the black and pink peppercorns, fennel and coriander seeds for 30 seconds, until they begin to pop and smell delicious., Remove the softened chillies from the soaking water and transfer to a spice grinder or small food processor. Add the toasted spices and a splash of the soaking water, then blitz to a fine paste., In a large bowl, mix the spice paste with the lemon zest, paprika, oil, vinegar and a pinch of sea salt. Pick in the oregano leaves, peel and crush in the garlic, then finely slice and stir through the chilli until combined. Add the butterflied lamb to the bowl and rub the marinade all over the meat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 to 6 hours, but ideally overnight., Remove from the fridge at least 30 minutes before you're ready to cook, so the lamb comes up to room temperature. Fire up your barbecue, then once hot, cook the meat for 40 to 45 minutes, or until medium-rare, turning it every 10 minutes or so., Transfer the lamb to a board and allow to rest for 15 minutes while you make your salad., Click off and combine the chicory leaves with the watercress and pomegranate seeds in a serving bowl., In a small bowl, stir the harissa through the yoghurt and season to taste., Slice the lamb on the board and halve the zested lemon. Serve the lamb on the board with the salad, yoghurt dressing and lemon halves on the side."

Bang them in the oven for 20 minutes., As they’re browning, peel and finely chop the onions, peel and finely slice the garlic, then halve and deseed the chillies., Get a casserole pan that will fit the shanks quite snugly — about 24cm in diameter and 10cm deep. Put it on a medium heat and add a lug of olive oil, the onions, garlic, fresh chilli, smoked paprika, bay leaves and rosemary. Leave to sweat for about 10 minutes., Once the onions have softened, put the rehydrated chillies and raisins into a food processor or liquidiser, along with any leftover apple juice, then blitz (feel free to sneak in a swig of red wine or bourbon here!) until you’ve got a paste. Stir this into your onions., Take your shanks out of the oven and turn the temperature down to 140°C/275°F/gas 1., Add the shanks to the casserole pan along with your tinned tomatoes and stock (if using) or equal amounts of water., Stir everything together, cover and put in the oven to stew for 2 hours 30 minutes to 3 hours, or until the meat is falling off the bone and the sauce is thick, topping up with water or stock as you go., Take it out of the oven, have a taste and season with salt and pepper and a dash of vinegar. Serve with steamed greens, mash, flatbreads, or whatever you fancy."

     ground cloves","Preheat the oven to full whack (240ºC/475ºF/gas 9)., Using a sharp knife, score a criss-cross pattern into any fat on the lamb shoulder., Pound the cumin, coriander and fennel seeds, the saffron and a good pinch of sea salt and white pepper in a pestle and mortar. Strip in the rosemary leaves and 2 thyme sprigs, finely grate in the orange zest, then muddle in the softened butter until combined., Rub all over the lamb, then tightly wrap in a layer of damp greaseproof paper and tin foil. Put into a roasting tray and place on the top shelf of the oven., Immediately reduce the temperature to 130ºC/250ºF/gas ½, and cook for 7 hours, or until falling off the bone., Halve the tomatoes and place in a large roasting tray with the bulb of garlic. Strip in the remaining thyme leaves, drizzle with oil and season with salt and black pepper., Place in the oven, underneath the lamb, for the last 4 hours, so the tomatoes are super-soft and caramelized., To make the pickle, finely slice the cabbage, then roughly chop the top leafy half of the parsley. Place in a large bowl and mix well with the vinegar and cloves., For the flatbreads, mix the flour, a good pinch of salt and 120ml of cold water into a dough. Knead on a clean flour-dusted surface for 2 minutes, then divide into 8 balls. Roll each into a thin round., In batches, cook the flatbreads in a large non-stick frying pan for 1 minute on each side, or until cooked but not coloured. Keep warm, wrapped in foil as you go., Shred the lettuce, then halve the pomegranate and, holding one half cut side down in your fingers, gently bash it with the back of a wooden spoon so all the seeds tumble out, and repeat., Decant the harissa into a bowl and season to perfection. Pick the mint leaves, pound in a pestle and mortar, then mix with the yoghurt and vinegar., Once ready, remove the tomatoes from the oven, squeeze the soft garlic out of their skins and mix. Using two forks, shred the lamb, removing and discarding the bones and any wobbly bits., Serve everything in the middle of the table and let everyone build their own delicious flatbread."

Melt-in-the-mouth lamb is the star, but this dish celebrates some amazing veggies, too. Big, rich, spiced sweet and savoury flavours, with little punches of warm heat all in one bowl – this is next-level food.

Peel the carrots and parsnips, slice at a slight angle 1cm thick, and drop them into the pan. Now peel the potatoes and cut into 4cm chunks., Strip all the lamb meat from the bone, and return the meat to the pan with the potatoes. Bring back to the boil, then simmer it all for 15 to 20 minutes, or until almost tender, while you wash the leeks and cut them into 1cm-thick slices., Now you can eat this straight away if you want to – simply stir the leeks into the pan, bring to the boil again, then simmer for 10 minutes with the lid on, or until tender. Taste and season to perfection., For even tastier results, let it chill overnight. In which case, simply stir in the raw leeks, cover, and pop into the fridge, where it will keep for up to 3 days. When you’re ready to serve, gently simmer the cawl until warm through, then season., Either way, ladle into serving bowls and serve with lots of black pepper, a wedge of mature Caerphilly cheese and a slice of good bread and butter for dunking."

Season with black pepper, then add the marinade, and toss to coat., Halve, deseed and cut the peppers into chunks, and cut the lemons into wedges, then thread onto 8 skewers, alternating between lamb, pepper, bay leaves and lemon wedges., Lay the skewers on a baking tray and roast in the hot oven for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until charred, sticky and cooked through, turning occasionally. Keep an eye on them – rotate the tray so that all the kebabs get a turn of being close to the fire and pull them back a little if the bread starts to burn., Pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, then scatter over the kebabs. Delicious served up with flatbreads, a dollop of Greek yoghurt and some sliced cucumber."

Add a splash of water to the tray, then roast for 4 hours, or until the meat is tender and will fall away from the bone., Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tray, then lift the lamb out onto a board, take all the meat and crispy skin off the bone and roughly chop it, reserving the bones., Skim away any fat from the tray and pop it into a clean jam jar. Add a splash of boiling water to the tray and stir around to pick up all the lovely sticky bits from the bottom. Keep it all to one side., For the filling, peel and roughly dice the onions, carrots, celery and swede, then put them into your biggest pan on a medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of reserved lamb fat. Strip in the rosemary leaves, then fry the veg for 20 minutes, or until lightly caramelised, stirring regularly., Stir in the flour, lamb, bones and tray juices, then pour in 1.5 litres of water. Bring to the boil, then put the lid on and reduce to a gentle simmer for 40 minutes, or until you’ve got a loose, stew-like consistency, stirring occasionally., To guarantee intense gravy and a tender but dense filling, remove and discard the bones, then place a large coarse sieve over a pan and, in batches, spoon the lamb stew into the sieve. Let the gravy drip through, and after a couple of minutes, when you get a dense pile of meat and veg in the sieve, transfer that to a bowl, leaving the gravy in the pan., Separately freeze half the cool meat and gravy for another day., For the topping, sides and bottom, peel and roughly chop the potatoes and cook in boiling salted water for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain and leave to steam dry, then add the butter, grate in half the cheese, season to perfection with salt and pepper, mash well and cool completely., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Use a little reserved lamb fat to grease the inside of a large pie dish (25cm x 30cm), then pick and tear over the rosemary leaves and sprinkle with half the breadcrumbs – they’ll stick to the fat and add an incredible crunch., A handful at a time, press the cooled mash into the dish, covering the bottom and sides with a 1cm-thick layer. Spoon in the filling and a couple of spoonfuls of gravy, smooth out, then top with the remaining mash, pat it flat, scuff it up with a fork and pinch it at the edges., Grate over the rest of the cheese, scatter with the remaining breadcrumbs and drizzle lightly with oil. Importantly, bake on the bottom of the oven for 1 hour 10 minutes, or until crisp and golden., Warm your gravy through (reducing if desired), then serve the pie with loads of seasonal greens or peas and lots of condiments."

the chilli., Drizzle the oil into a small frying pan, then add the garlic, chilli and ginger, and fry for about 1 minute, until softening, but not coloured., Add the mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds and curry leaves, and fry for a further 1 to 2 minutes, until the mustard seeds start to pop. Set aside to cool., Cut the meat and onion into 1cm cubes and drain the chickpeas. Finely chop the tomatoes and break the cauliflower into very small florets., Put all the filling ingredients in a large bowl, mix in the cooled spices and a dash of oil, then set aside., For the pastry, sift the flour into a bowl, add a pinch of salt, then rub in the butter with your fingertips. Pour in 150ml water and mix with your hands, squeezing until the pastry comes together. Add more water if needed, but try not to overwork it., Divide the pastry into 8 equal pieces and shape each one into a ball. Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour, then roll out each piece of pastry to the thickness of a pound coin, dusting and turning as you go. Repeat until you have 8 rounds., Place an even amount of filling on one side of each pastry sheet and brush the edges of the pastry with a little beaten egg. Pull the other half of the pastry over, feel where the filling is and use your thumb to press down and seal around the edges. Brush the pasties all over with the beaten egg, place on an oiled baking tray and cook in the hot oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden., Meanwhile, prepare the salad.

Place it all in a food processor with the rest of the marinade ingredients and blitz until smooth., Using a sharp knife, make about 10 incisions, roughly 4cm deep, all over the lamb, then poke a few curry leaves into each one., Sit the lamb in a snug-fitting roasting tray and massage half the marinade all over it. Pour the remainder around the lamb in the tray, then cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight., When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/ gas 7 and remove the lamb from the fridge to come up to room temperature., Drizzle the lamb with olive oil and add a splash of water to the tray, then roast for 30 minutes., Reduce the oven temperature to 130ºC/250ºF/gas ½ and roast for a further 2 hours 30 minutes to 3 hours 30 minutes, or until the meat is tender and falls away from the bone., Remove the lamb to a board, cover with tin foil and leave to rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Peel the ginger and garlic, deseed the chilli, then finely slice it all., Transfer any excess fat from the roasting tray to a small jar to use another time, then place the tray over a medium heat on the hob. Stir in the mustard seeds and curry leaves for 1 minute, then add the ginger, garlic and chilli. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden., Roughly chop and add the tomatoes, then stir in the coconut milk and simmer for a few minutes, or until thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally. Season to perfection with sea salt, black pepper and a splash of vinegar or a squeeze of lemon juice, then pour on to a large serving platter., Place the lamb on top, pick over the coriander leaves, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, and place in the middle of the table, ready to be sliced and served. Good with all the trimmings – rice, chapattis or poppadoms and a fresh zingy salad."

Add the remaining bay, runny honey, a good lug of white wine vinegar, the juice of half an orange, and the pistachios. Return to the oven and roast for a further 30 minutes, or until golden and sticky., Meanwhile, drizzle some olive oil over the chops and place on the barbecue, positioning them so the meaty part of the chop is on the cool side and the thinner bone on the hotter side. Grill for around 15 minutes, or until cooked through and gnarly, turning regularly (be careful as the fat may spit)., Finely grate the lemon zest over the bulgur, then squeeze in half the juice. Add a good lug of extra virgin olive oil, season well and mix together., Spoon the bulgar onto a serving platter, layer over half the roasted carrots and onions, then place the sizzling lamb chops on top. Add the remaining veg, golden pistachios and any lovely juices from the tray, then serve with dollops of yoghurt, crumbled feta and finely chopped parsley leaves – delicious!"

They serve their haggis on large spoons instead of in the sheep’s stomach (which is the traditional way). So I've decided to write a recipe that anyone, anywhere in the world, can make as long as they have access to a fairly decent butcher. I think it still preserves the beautiful soul and attitude of haggis, and my mate Peter Begg, who is 110% Scottish, says it’s the nicest haggis he’s ever had.

processor with the bacon and thyme leaves and pulse until finely chopped. Put a very large casserole-type pan (roughly 25cm in diameter) on a medium heat, add a good lug of olive oil, then add the allspice, pepper, ground cloves, a good pinch of salt, and grate in the nutmeg. Stir for a few minutes, until it’s smelling fantastic, then tip in everything from the food processor and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until the veg are starting to soften., Cut the steak into roughly 2cm pieces and pulse in a food processor until it looks like mince. Add to the pan of veg, then do the same with the lamb or mutton and the heart. Get rid of any sinewy bits. Halve the kidneys, and quickly rinse them and the livers in a bowl of water. Drain, then pulse in the processor once or twice – don’t purée them! Add to the pan, then cook and stir everything for about 15 minutes, or until the meat starts to colour. At this point, add the bay leaves and 500ml of stock or water, then cover with a lid and leave to blip away on a low heat for around 2 hours, stirring now and then to make sure it doesn’t catch and adding a splash of water if needed., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. After 2 hours, spoon a few ladles of the haggis mixture (avoiding the bay leaves) into the clean food processor and blitz to a fairly smooth consistency. Stir this back in to add a lovely creaminess. Spread the pinhead oats on a baking tray and toast in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until golden. Stir into the haggis mixture, then add the remaining stock. Simmer with the lid off for about another 30 to 35 minutes. This is a great time to cook your neeps and tatties., Once the time is up, fish out the bay leaves and continue cooking until you’ve got a nice thick consistency. Turn the heat off, then correct the seasoning to push it to the point of perfection. Stir in the whisky, a few gratings of lemon and orange zest and the Worcestershire sauce. Taste and correct the flavours if needed, then put the lid on and leave until you’re ready to serve – preferably with plenty of good friends and a dram or two of fine Scottish whisky., PS: Put the leftover haggis into an earthenware-type dish and top it off with neeps and tatties. It makes the most exciting sorta-shepherd’s pie."

With damp hands, shape the meat around and along each skewer, pressing little indents into the meat as you go, for a nice texture., Grill the kebabs on a barbecue for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, then push to the cool side and warm your tortillas next to them for 30 seconds (you can cook everything on a griddle pan or under the grill, if you prefer)., Transfer the tortillas to plates and top each with a little lettuce. Drizzle with olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice, if you like., Slip the meat off the skewers and break it up, add a dollop of yoghurt and drizzle over any resting juices. Finely chop and sprinkle with chilli (deseed if you like) for an extra kick, then tuck in. Delicious!"

black pepper, the mint and paprika., Finely grate over the lemon zest and squeeze over the juice, then drizzle with oil and massage the flavours into the chops. Leave to marinate for 1 hour., Meanwhile, crush the fennel and cumin seeds in a pestle and mortar, then tip onto a baking tray with the almonds. Drizzle with a little oil, season and toss to coat., Toast in the preheated oven until lightly golden, then remove and allow to cool., For the coleslaw, peel and shred the carrots and celeriac on a mandolin (use the guard!). Remove the core from the cabbage and peel the onion, then slice as finely as you can with a sharp knife. Pick and finely chop the coriander leaves and stalks., Place all the veg in a bowl with the yoghurt and coriander stalks, then finely grate in the lime zest and squeeze in the juice. Mix well and season with salt and pepper., Scoop the houmous into a nice bowl, spoon the harissa and a lug of oil on top and swirl them half in with a spoon to get a rippled effect., Put the cooled spiced nuts into a sandwich bag and smash them up with the bottom of a pan or a rolling pin., Preheat a griddle pan to high, then cook the lamb for 3 minutes on each side, or until cooked to medium., Serve the chops in a pile on one end of a chopping board and arrange the bowl of houmous, coleslaw and spicy nuts nicely around them, then sprinkle with the coriander leaves. Dip a chop in the houmous, then in the nuts and eat with the coleslaw – delicious!"

Pull all the meat off the bone, saving the bone for later., Wash, trim and roughly chop the leek, peel and finely slice the onions, then trim and roughly chop the carrots and celery., Place the leek, celery, onions and carrots into a large pan on a low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, and cook gently for 20 minutes, or until soft and sweet, stirring regularly., Pour in the stock, and add the reserved lamb bone (if you have it). Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 20 minutes, while you peel and roughly chop the swede and potato., Add pearl barley to the pan, followed by the swede and potato, then simmer gently for a further 50 minutes, or until tender., Remove the pan from the heat and whisk the broth quite hard to break down some of the potato and bind the soup together, then stir in the roast lamb or cooked lamb, to heat through. Taste and season to perfection with salt and pepper., Pick the parsley leaves, then sprinkle over the broth with the reserved celery leaves (if using). Serve with hunks of crusty bread for dunking, and if you want to be really authentic, why not add a little dram of whisky to each bowl?"

regular cut into something a bit special for Easter, and this recipe ensures it’ll be bursting with flavour. If you’ve never made homemade gravy before, give it a go – you can’t beat it!, Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Turn the leg of lamb upside down on a chopping board and very gently cut halfway down into the leg along the bone so the meat opens out, creating a pocket., Make your stuffing by peeling a couple of garlic cloves and popping them into a food processor. As it’s whizzing away, add the parsley and rosemary leaves, then the anchovies. Scrape this mixture into a bowl, then add the ciabatta and pine nuts to the processor. You want it to be quite coarse so just pulse it a few times, then tip it into your bowl of herbs along with the chopped olives and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper, then get your clean hands in the bowl and scrunch everything together. If it looks too dry, add a little lemon juice., Pack this stuffing into the pocket of the lamb, then wrap the meat back over and tie it tightly with string, pushing the remaining rosemary sprigs underneath the string. Drizzle over a little olive oil, pat this into the lamb and season with salt and pepper., Place your roughly chopped onion, carrot and celery in a roasting tray with any remaining unpeeled garlic cloves and lay your lamb on top. Roast for about an hour and a half. In Italy, they’ll start basting the lamb after 30 minutes by pouring a swig of wine over the meat and veg every 15 minutes or so until the meat is cooked. Trust me – it is well worth doing and makes it juicy and delicious! When cooked, transfer the lamb to a board or platter to rest while you make your gravy., Spoon off most of the fat from your tray, then put it on the hob over a low heat. Add the flour and mash everything together with a potato masher. Add a glass of red wine and bring to the boil, to cook off the alcohol. Pour in the stock and bring back to the boil, scraping all the goodness from the bottom of the pan as you go. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes., Sieve your gravy into a jug or pan, using a ladle to really push all the goodness through. Discard any veg or meat left behind. At this point, your lamb will have been resting for around 15 minutes and will be perfect for serving. Dish it up and tuck in!"

            fat-free natural yoghurt","Lay the chops out, and massage in the ground cumin and the grated ginger and about 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Then leave to marinate for at least an hour, but preferably overnight., Toast the almonds under a hot grill or in an oven until light brown. When cool, place in a plastic bag, squeeze all the air out of it, knot the end and smash with a rolling pin until the nuts are crushed. Keep to one side., Heat a saucepan and toast the pepper, cloves, cinnamon and cardamom until a shade darker in colour. Remove and grind in a pestle and mortar., Melt the butter in the hot pan and when sizzling, add the garlic, turmeric and onion. Cook for a few minutes until soft, then add the tomatoes and ground spices. Stew the tomatoes down before adding the yoghurt. Bring to the boil, stirring, and turn the heat down so that the yoghurt simmers gently. It will probably curdle a little, but don’t worry, a blast from a hand blender will sort that out. Cook gently for about 20 minutes until the sauce begins to thicken. Season carefully with salt and turn the heat off., When you’re ready to serve, preheat a ridged griddle pan on a back ring of your cooker (it’s safer). Season the lamb with salt and pepper, griddle for 1½ minutes each side or until cooked to medium. Quickly blend the sauce if it has curdled and serve with almonds, the shoot salad and some fluffy rice."

Light the barbecue and prepare a hot side and a cooler side., Halve the lemongrass lengthways, and peel and roughly chop the ginger and garlic, then bash in a large pestle and mortar with the lime leaves., Add the cumin, finely grate in the zest from 1 lemon, and squeeze in its juice. Mix well., Season the lamb with sea salt and black pepper, then rub the marinade all over and leave to marinate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight., Place the lamb in a snug-fitting roasting tray, cover tightly with a double layer of tin foil, then roast for 40 minutes if you like your meat pink, or slightly longer if you prefer it more well done., Transfer the lamb to the hot side of the barbecue for 10 to 15 minutes, or until you have a lovely smoky, crispy surface – it will sizzle and there might even be a few flames, but move it around to stop it burning. Remove to a board to rest., Meanwhile, pick, finely chop and place the mint leaves in a bowl, add a few good dollops of yoghurt and a good squeeze of lemon juice, then mix together and season to perfection., Slice up the lamb, then serve with the minty yoghurt and wedges of lemon for squeezing over. Delicious served with a seasonal salad."

Spike the flour with a teaspoon of sea salt and black pepper. Toss the lamb cubes in the seasoned flour., Heat a large pan and pour in 2 tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil starts to smoke, add as many lamb pieces as will fit in one layer, cover with a lid and cook for a few minutes until soft and browned evenly. Remove from the pan, then repeat with the remaining cubes until they are all browned. Return all the lamb to the pan and turn the heat down., Add the onion, celery, garlic, cinnamon, walnuts and bay leaves to the pan. Put the lid back on and cook very gently for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring often to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan, until the onion is softened., Cut your pomegranates in half and ease out a few of the seeds and put to one side. Juice them as you would an orange or lemon. You should end up with about 500ml of juice. (If you can't find pomegranates, shop-bought cranberry juice works well instead.)  Stir the juice into the lamb and top up with water to cover. Simmer very gently for 1½ hours, or until the lamb is tender, adding a little water now and then if the stew gets dry., Remove and discard the cinnamon stick and bay leaves. Season to taste and sprinkle with the parsley and reserved pomegranate seeds. Lovely served with steaming hot saffron rice."

Halve the fresh tomatoes., Rub the lamb with oil, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and put it into a roasting tray. Using a sharp knife, make small incisions all over the lamb, then pick and poke rosemary leaves and quartered garlic cloves into each one., Add the rest of the garlic cloves, the onions, carrots, celery, leeks and fresh tomatoes to the tray, then tuck the remaining herbs under the meat., Pour the tinned tomatoes over the top, followed by the wine. Cover the tray tightly with a double layer of tin foil and place in the oven. Turn down the oven temperature to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3 and cook for 3½ to 4 hours, or until the lamb is soft, melting and sticky and you can pull it apart with a fork., Gently break up the meat, pull out the bones, and extract any herb stalks. Squeeze the garlic out of the skins and mush it in. Shred the lamb, check the seasoning and serve with some crispy roast potatoes."

, for crumbling over","I came up with this recipe when I was in Wales, which produces some of the best lamb in the world. Ask your butcher for extra long lamb cutlets, untrimmed, so you have big Captain Caveman style chops to gnaw on. Marinate the lamb overnight if you can, to really intensify the flavours, which are inspired by the amazing Yemeni cooks I met in the old Tiger Bay community near the docks in Cardiff. Their community has been there for over 200 years, ever since the coal boom of the industrial revolution brought their ancestors to Wales. Their food hasn’t become famous in the same way other cuisines have. But it should have. It’s some of the most exciting food I’ve seen in a long time., Pound the marinade spices, chillies and garlic to a paste using a pestle and mortar, add a good pinch of salt and pepper, then muddle in just enough olive oil to make the mixture nice and loose. Get a roasting tray, put in the cutlets and rub the marinade all over them. Cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge, or to one side if you’re cooking right away., Now get all your little dips ready. Put the nuts, sesame seeds, cumin and a pinch of salt into a dry frying pan and toast for a few minutes, tossing occasionally. Once golden, tip them into the mortar and pound up a few times until fine and crunchy, then pour them into a little bowl. Coarsely grate the cucumber on a box grater, then transfer it to a bowl, squeezing out any excess liquid. Finely chop the mint and add it to the bowl with the yoghurt, a good pinch of salt and pepper, and a good squeeze of lemon juice. Stir, then put into a little bowl next to the toasted nuts., Halve the tomatoes and rub each half, cut side down, on the finer side of the grater so you end up with a fresh tomato slurry. Discard the skins, then finely grate in half the chilli. Season with salt and pepper, stir in a squeeze of lemon juice, sprinkle over some coriander leaves, and crumble over a little feta. Have a taste, adjust if you want it a bit spicier, or saltier, then put it into a little bowl next to the other dips., Heat a griddle pan on a high heat and cook the lamb cutlets for around 4 minutes on each side, standing them on their fatty sides for a minute or two extra to crisp up. Once they are sizzling and golden, they’re done. Pile them on a board, then get stuck in and encourage everyone to dunk the chops in the dips and some of the based up nuts. Lovely with flatbreads or rice."

Meanwhile, squeeze the seeds from the tomatoes, and destone the olives., Heat a lug of oil in a large frying pan over a high heat, add the lamb rack and sear until golden, then remove to a plate., Crush the drained potatoes and tip into the frying pan, then fry for a couple of minutes over a medium-low heat., Stir in the tomatoes and olives, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Pick in the rosemary, scatter over the unpeeled garlic cloves, and drizzle with a little oil. Transfer to a roasting tray., Place the lamb on top of the potatoes. Depending on the size of the racks, the lamb will take somewhere between 20 and 30 minutes to cook, but will still be pink in the middle – use your instincts (add 5 to 10 minutes if you like your meat well done)., When the lamb is cooked to your liking, slice it into chops and serve with the crispy potatoes. Delicious served with a little salsa verde or an extra drizzle of oil."

Toss in a little olive oil with a sprinkling of salt, pepper and the dried oregano., When the time's up, remove the lamb from the oven, pour away most of the fat, then pick over the rosemary., Scatter the aubergine and onion in and around the lamb, then place back in the oven for 1 hour., Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Peel and finely slice the garlic, and pick and finely chop the parsley (stalks and all). Crumble the chilli., Heat a splash of olive oil in a pan over a medium heat, add the garlic and parsley stalks and fry for 1 minute, then add the tomatoes, a pinch of salt and pepper, a good swig of vinegar, the dried chilli and the anchovy fillets. Simmer for 30 minutes., Make a point of checking the veg and lamb after 20 minutes – turn the lamb over and stir the veggies, making sure they don’t dry out, adding a splash of water, if needed., Once cooked, remove the lamb to a platter, cover with tin foil and allow to rest., Pour away any excess fat from the lamb tray, then tip the tomato sauce over the roasted aubergines and onions., Place the tray on a medium heat, and using a wooden spoon, scrape loose all the sticky bits at the bottom but try not to break up the veg too much – you want it to be a chunky sauce, not a pulp. Add most of the parsley leaves and simmer for a couple of minutes on a gentle heat., Now taste the sauce – it should be slightly sweet and slightly sour, so it may need another little swig of vinegar. When you’re happy, pour the sauce either on to a separate platter or on to the same one as the lamb., Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle over the reserved parsley. Delicious served with warm bread and a seasonal salad."

What you want to do is delicately flavour the meat, so pound up the coriander seeds with the rosemary and a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar (or use a metal bowl and a rolling pin) until nice and fine. Take half this mixture and rub it over the inside of the lamb. Season it well with salt and pepper, then roll up the lamb and secure it with 4 or 5 pieces of string. The reason for doing this is to make the meat a consistent thickness – don't worry about doing it neatly, as long as it holds together it's fine., Put a high-sided roasting tray on the hob and brown the lamb on all sides in a little olive oil. Remove from the heat, allow the lamb to cool a little, then add the red onions to the tray. Lift up the lamb, stir the onions around to cover them in all the flavoursome juices, then sit the lamb back on top and cook in the preheated oven for around 2 hours, adding the cranberry juice after the first half an hour and turning the heat down to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3., Turn the meat in its cooking juices when you can. By the end of the 2 hours you want the meat to be nice and crisp on the outside but really melt-in-your-mouth and tender. Sometimes the lamb may need a little longer, depending on the age of the animal. You'll also want enough juice left in the bottom of the tray to give everyone a nice spoonful – if it looks as if the liquid is going to cook away too quickly, add a little water and place a cartouche on top. Skim off any fat that cooks out of the meat., While the lamb is cooking, rub the butternut squash with the rest of the spice mix and a drizzle of olive oil. Lay it in another roasting tray, season well and put it in the oven when the lamb's been cooking for just over an hour. Cook for around 45 minutes, until sweet and tender., When the lamb's cooked, let it rest for 10 minutes, then remove the string. In a bowl mix together the coriander leaves, spring onions, lemon juice, 4 tablespoons of olive oil and seasoning. Toss together., To serve, divide the squash between your plates, cut up the lamb into irregular sized slices, spoon over some tray juices, and sprinkle on the herb salad. A dollop of yoghurt on top is lovely."

Pat the dry rub all over the burgers, then drizzle over a tiny bit of olive oil., You can either cook the burgers on a barbecue or indoors on a griddle – either light the barbecue and prepare a hot side and a cooler side, or if cooking indoors, heat a large griddle pan over a medium-high heat., Cook the burgers for 6 to 7 minutes on each side, or until done to your liking, then remove to a plate., Quickly halve and lightly toast the buns on the cool side of the barbecue or in the griddle., Spoon the yoghurt into a small bowl and dollop the harissa on top. Squeeze over a little lemon juice to loosen, then ripple the harissa through the yoghurt and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Pick the mint leaves., Spread some harissa yoghurt onto the bases of the toasted buns, top with the burgers, squashing them gently into the buns. Add a little more yoghurt, then squeeze the remaining lemon juice over a the mint leaves and place on top. Delicious served with a seasonal salad."

and dried chillies. Add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then pound to a paste, stirring in a couple of tablespoons of oil., Pour half the marinade over the lamb, and massage well before you plait it, then put aside until needed., Peel and chop the sweet potatoes into 2.5cm chunks, peel and roughly chop the onions, and peel and finely slice the garlic, then mix with the remaining marinade., Heat a little oil in a large ovenproof pan or roasting tray over a medium-high heat, add the lamb and quickly brown on both sides, then remove to a plate., Add the sweet potato mixture to the pan and fry for around 4 minutes, or until the onions are slightly soft., Add the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, then give the pan a shake and place the meat on top., Add 3 wineglasses of water, the cinnamon stick, bay leaves and dried apricots, and braise in the preheated oven for 1 hour 15 minutes (I suggest you do this with the lid off to give it a little colour., Cover the couscous with 300ml boiling water and leave to fluff up. Season with salt, pepper, a lug of oil and a swig of vinegar, cover with tin foil and place in the oven for 5 minutes to steam., Pick and roughly chop the coriander and scatter over the lamb before serving. Divide between plates with the couscous and spoon over a good dollop of natural yoghurt."

Add salt to taste, cover with a lid or a couple of tight layers of foil, then simmer on a low heat for around 1½ hours  or transfer into a deep baking tin cover with foil and finish cooking it in the oven at 150°C/300°F/gas 2 for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender., Tip the dry couscous into a serving tin. Then pour the boiling vegetable stock on to the couscous - it should just cover it.

A thousand pictures go through my head just thinking about my old man slicing lamb on a Sunday. This brilliant roast lamb dish uses Italian staples to make a delicious stuffing – it’s nice to get all the herbs in the ingredients list, but if you can only get hold of a couple, don’t worry., Try to buy the lamb from your own butcher or a supermarket with a qualified butcher’s section. Tell them you want a nice leg of lamb, preferably organic, with the H-bone and thigh-bone tunnel-boned and removed. This sounds complicated but it’s just butchers’ jargon. It means the top half of the leg has the bone removed leaving just the ankle bone, allowing you to stuff it. For the veg, turnips, Jerusalem artichokes, celeriac, fennel and parsnips are all good., Peel a couple of garlic cloves and pop them into a food processor – as it’s whizzing add your mixed herbs. Add the pancetta and anchovies and whiz again. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and add the bread to the processor. Whiz to coarse breadcrumbs, and add to the bowl with the pine nuts and olives. Add salt and pepper and scrunch everything together with your hands. If it looks too dry, add a drop of boiling water. Push the stuffing into the cavity in the lamb. You can roast it stuffed like this, or you can tie it up with string, pushing some rosemary underneath. Pat it with olive oil on the outside and season with salt and pepper., Toss the potatoes and remaining garlic with the bay leaves, the rest of the rosemary and some olive oil, salt and pepper and put them into a roasting tray with the lamb in the middle. It’s unusual to see rare or pink roasted meats in Italy, so we’re going to cook our lamb like they do. Roast it for about an hour and a half at 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Trust me – it will be juicy and delicious! After half an hour, the Italian way is to start basting the lamb with a swig of wine over the meat and veg every 15 minutes or so until the meat is cooked. Remove the veg to a dish when cooked to keep them warm., When the lamb is cooked, let it rest for 15 minutes. It’s nice served with some simply cooked greens. The Italians prefer the goodness from the meat juices to be cooked into the vegetables in the tray rather than make gravy."

It's hot and sweet, so do yourself a favour and get stuck in., To make the balti, marinate the lamb in the lime zest and juice and yoghurt for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the sesame oil in a wok or frying pan and fry the sweet potato cubes until just golden. Throw in the green beans and dates, and pour in the jar of balti sauce and the stock. Toss in the marinated lamb pieces and cook for 15 to 20 minutes over a moderate heat until cooked through., To make the raita, mix the chilli, cucumber and lemon zest and juice with the crème fraîche, and season to taste. Serve the balti garnished with a sprig or two of fresh coriander, and a bowl of raita on the side. It's also delicious served on some basmati rice, cooked according to packet instructions, along with some naan bread."

Add the garam masala and a good pinch of sea salt and give it a stir. Keep frying until the meat is lovely and crispy., Shave the carrots into long thin strips with a speed peeler or a mandolin slicer and keep them to one side., Heat a small frying pan over a moderate heat and toast the cumin seeds for 30 seconds – they will start to smell nutty and gorgeous. You’re not trying to cook the seeds here, you’re just waking their flavours up a bit., Put them into a pestle and mortar and grind them up. Place the pan back on the heat and toast the sesame seeds until golden. Transfer them to a plate., Slice your peeled shallots or onion wafer thin. As with all salads that contain onion, you don’t want to be coming across great big chunks! If you don’t feel confident about your knife skills, use the coarse side of a box grater instead. This will almost mush your onions to a purée, but at least you won’t come across any big bits., To make your dressing, grate the lemon zest and squeeze the juice into a bowl and add the shallots or onion, grated ginger, ground cumin and a pinch of salt. Whisk everything together with about 5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil., Pour the dressing over the carrots, add the coriander and mint leaves, and mix it all together using your fingers. It’s important that you have a little taste to check whether the dressing needs more lemon juice, oil or seasoning., Divide the crunchy lamb mince between four plates and put the dressed salad on top. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds. Served with naan bread, some yoghurt and lemon halves, this makes a great snack!"

    red wine vinegar","Preheat the oven to full whack., Lay half the rosemary into the bottom of a high-sided roasting tray. Break up the garlic bulb, then scatter in half of the unpeeled cloves., Slash the fat side of the lamb all over with a sharp knife, then rub with oil, sea salt and black pepper. Place into the tray, then scatter the remaining rosemary and garlic on top., Tightly cover the tray with tin foil and place in the oven. Immediately turn the temperature down to 170°C/325°F/gas 3 and cook for around 4 hours – it’s done if you can pull the meat apart easily with two forks., Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and chop into large chunks. Peel the carrots and swede, then chop into small chunks. Prep the greens by separating out the leaves and finely slicing any tougher stalks., When the lamb is nearly cooked, put your potatoes, carrots and swede into a large pot of boiling salted water and boil hard for 20 minutes, or until tender., Drain and allow to steam dry, then smash them up in the pan with a knob of butter. If you prefer a smooth texture, add some cooking water. Spoon into a bowl, cover with tin foil and keep warm over a pan of simmering water until needed., Once cooked to perfection, remove the lamb from the oven and place it on a chopping board. Cover with tin foil, then a tea towel, and leave to rest., Put a large pan of salted water on to boil for your greens., Pour away most of the fat from the roasting tray, discarding any bits of rosemary stalk. Put the tray on the hob over a medium heat and mix in the flour., Pour in the stock, stirring and scraping all the sticky goodness from the bottom of the tray. You won’t need gallons of gravy, just a couple of flavoursome spoonfuls each. Drain, finely chop and add the capers, then turn the heat down and simmer for a few minutes., Pick and finely chop the mint and add it to the sauce with the red wine vinegar at the last minute, then pour into a jug., Place the greens and stalks into the pan of fast-boiling salted water and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, to just soften. Drain and toss with the remaining knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper., Place everything in the middle of the table, and shred the lamb in front of your guests. Absolutely delish!"

Cook over a medium-high heat, until the onions start to caramelise, stirring as you go., Add the raisins and marmalade, then add the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and booze. Give it all a good stir, then leave to gently simmer over a medium-low heat., Put the lamb shanks into a large frying pan (30cm wide) on a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil – cook them in batches, if needed, turning regularly., Once the lamb has some good colour, pick in the rosemary leaves and move them around in the pan to get crispy, but don’t let them burn., Using tongs, move the shanks into the pan of onions, then pour in all their juices and the crispy rosemary., Add the stock, put the lid on, turn the heat down to low and leave to slowly blip away for 3 hours, or until the meat falls off the bone easily, turing halfway for even cooking., Once cooked, carefully move the shanks to a platter, making sure the meat stays intact., Whiz or liquidize the gravy with a stick blender until smooth, then allow to thicken and reduce on the hob., Quickly bash most of the mint leaves in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of salt and the olive or rapeseed oil, then take to the table., Trim and finely slice the spring onions and toss on a plate with the remaining fresh mint leaves, a drizzle of cider vinegar and a pinch of salt., Add a little splash of cider vinegar and a few more splashes of Worcestershire sauce to the sauce, then ladle it all over the lamb shanks, pouring the rest into a jug for people to help themselves., Scatter the vinegary spring onions and a few fresh mint leaves all over the top, and drizzle the mint oil all around the shanks. Delicious served with potato and celeriac mash – the plate will be clean before you know it."

natural yoghurt","This dish is best cooked on a barbecue over hot coals, but if that’s not possible, put your grill on to its highest setting or heat up a griddle pan. Either way, get your cooking source preheated., Place the lamb in a food processor with most of the thyme, chilli, cumin and sumac (reserving a little of each for sprinkling over later), a little sea salt and black pepper and all the pistachios. Put the lid on and keep pulsing until the mixture looks like mince., Divide the meat into six equal pieces and get yourself six skewers. With damp hands, push and shape the meat around and along each skewer. Press little indents in the meat with your fingers as you go – this will give it a better texture when cooked., In one bowl, mix the salad leaves and mint. In another, combine the sliced onion with a good pinch of salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice (the acidity will take the edge off and lightly pickle the raw onion). Scrunch this all together with your hands, then mix in the parsley leaves., Grill the kebabs until nicely golden on all sides. Dress your salad leaves and mint with a splash of extra virgin olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and some salt and pepper., Meanwhile, warm your flatbreads for 30 seconds on your griddle pan or under the grill, then divide between plates and top each with some dressed salad leaves and onion., When your kebabs are cooked, slip them off their skewers on to the flatbreads – you can leave them whole or break them up as I’ve done here. Sprinkle with the rest of the sumac, cumin, chilli and fresh thyme, and a little salt and pepper., Now either toss the salads, grilled meat and juices together on top of the flatbreads and drizzle with some of the yoghurt before rolling up and serving; or let your friends toss theirs together at the table, then dress and roll up their own, drizzled with some extra virgin olive oil."

This dish just makes you feel really happy, and it’s also dead cheap to make. ”",751,46.0g,17.4g,6.0g,2.5g,57.6g,25.4g,3.8g,"800                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                diced stewing lamb, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh rosemary, 2                                                                                                                                                                heaped tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                plain flour, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red onion, 8                                                                                                                                                                                                                    field mushrooms, 1                                                                                                                                                                handful of                                                                                                                                                                baby carrots, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    parsnip, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                Marmite, 2                                                                                                                                                                heaped tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                pearl barley, 285                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                rich ale                                                                                                                                                                , such as Guinness, Caffrey’s, John Smith’s 550ml organic stock, 550                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                organic stock, 18                                                                                                                                                                                                                    higher-welfare chipolata sausages, 6                                                                                                                                                                woody sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh rosemary                                                                                                                                                                , (optional)","Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Roughly dice the lamb and put into a bowl. Season well with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves and add to the bowl with the flour. Mix around so that the meat is completely covered., Fry the lamb in a couple of tablespoons of oil in a hot casserole pan — do this in batches so the pieces get a nice bit of colour, then remove to a plate., Turn the heat down. Peel and roughly chop the onion, tear the mushrooms in half, and peel and grate the parsnip., Fry the onion, mushrooms and carrots for 5 minutes, or until soft and slightly coloured. Add the lamb back to the pan along with the parsnip, Marmite, pearl barley, ale and stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 20 minutes while you strip the leaves off the woody rosemary sprigs and skewer 3 chipolatas on to each of them (or use skewers)., Just before the stew goes in the oven, add the chipolatas to the pan, then place a lid on or make a cartouche, wet it and tuck this over the pan., Cook for 1 hour, or until the lamb falls apart. I love to eat it just as it is, almost like a thick soup, with some crusty bread."

Pick and roughly chop half the rosemary leaves. Peel and halve the potatoes., Crush the peeled garlic into a bowl, add the chopped rosemary, finely grate in the lemon zest and drizzle in a good lug of oil, then mix together., Season the lamb with sea salt and black pepper, then drizzle with the marinade and rub all over the meat. Place on the hot bars of the oven above the tray., Parboil the potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water for 10 minutes, then drain and allow to steam dry. Gently toss the potatoes in the colander to scuff up the edges, then tip back into the pan., Add the remaining rosemary sprigs and whole garlic cloves to the potatoes, season with salt and pepper, then drizzle over a good lug of oil. Tip the potatoes into the hot tray and place back under the lamb to catch all the lovely juices., Cook the lamb for 1 hour 15 minutes if you want it pink, or 1 hour 30 minutes if you like it more well done., Meanwhile, make the mint sauce. Pick and finely chop the mint leaves, then place in a small bowl. Mix in the sugar, a good pinch of salt, 1 tablespoon of hot water and the vinegar., When the lamb is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven and leave to rest for 15 minutes or so. Carve and serve with the roast potatoes, mint sauce and some seasonal greens."

Otherwise use a preheated ridged griddle pan. Slap the cutlets with the heel of your hand to flatten them slightly. Then bash up your thyme in a pestle and mortar and add a little olive oil. Mix together, then rub the oil over the cutlets and season both sides of them. Put to one side., Cook the mushrooms dry on the bars of your hot griddle pan. This is quite an unusual way to do it, but it gives you a nutty flavour that you wouldn’t get otherwise. Just grill them on both sides to mark them and put them into a large bowl. Once the mushrooms are done you can put the lamb on the barbecue or griddle pan. If the cutlets are about 1.5cm thick, just give them 3 or 4 minutes on each side until they’re really golden. This should cook them medium. (To be honest, I’m not really into rare lamb cutlets, but if you prefer them like that then cook for a little less time.), When cooked, put the lamb cutlets into the bowl with the mushrooms and drizzle with a little olive oil. Tear over the parsley, in quite large pieces, and add a good squeeze of lemon juice. Season lightly and toss around. Place to one side to rest, to allow all the lovely juices to get sucked up by the mushrooms., Meanwhile you can make a really quick sauce. It looks a bit like pesto, but although it contains basil and pine nuts it has no similarity in flavour. In a pestle and mortar pound up the pine nuts until you have a mushy pulp – this will give the sauce a creamy flavour and texture. Remove the mixture to a bowl, then use the pestle and mortar to bash the basil up into a pulp. Add this to the pine nuts and loosen with extra virgin olive oil so that the sauce easily drops off the end of a spoon., Now you need to balance it with quite a lot of balsamic vinegar to give it a good zing, almost like a mint sauce, but add it to taste. Give the lamb and mushrooms a final toss. I like to serve this up on a big platter and let everyone help themselves. Have the sauce and a simple watercress salad on the side."

Five years on and nothing's changed, but I wanted to get him cooking, so this is something I invented for him to try out. It's so easy to make because all it involves is throwing a few things into the pot and leaving it in the oven for a while. In Andy's case, he'll go to a football match while it's cooking so it's ready as soon as he gets home.  ”",675,20.8g,4.8g,17.2g,1.2g,60.6g,65g,11g,"700                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                potatoes, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red onions, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    carrots, 2                                                                                                                                                                sticks of                                                                                                                                                                celery, 2                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh rosemary, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                level teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                ground cumin, 1                                                                                                                                                                heaped tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                smoked paprika, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    orange, 800                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                lamb or higher-welfare pork stewing steak                                                                                                                                                                , (cubed), 1 x                                                                                                                                                                400g tin of                                                                                                                                                                chickpeas, 2 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tins of                                                                                                                                                                quality plum tomatoes, natural yoghurt, ½ a                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh coriander                                                                                                                                                                , (15g)","First of all, you need to preheat the oven, but the temperature will depend on how long you want to cook the stew for. If you want it ready in 3 hours, preheat it to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4, but if you want to cook it for 6 hours, then you need the oven on at 140ºC/275ºF/gas 1., Peel and chop the potatoes into 2.5cm chunks, then peel, trim and roughly chop the onions, carrots and celery. Pick the rosemary leaves., Put a large casserole pan on a high heat and add a couple of good lugs of oil. Let this heat up, then add the potatoes, onions, carrots, celery, rosemary, cumin and paprika., Finely grate in the orange zest and squeeze in the juice, then stir together. Cook for 1 minute, then mix around again before adding the meat., Drain and tip in the chickpeas, followed by the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of a spoon., Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, then pour over enough water to cover everything. Bring to the boil and put into the oven for your chosen amount of time. You are now free to go out for a few hours (for the whole day if you want to!)., Serve the stew in bowls with a dollop of yoghurt, and pick over the coriander leaves to finish."
