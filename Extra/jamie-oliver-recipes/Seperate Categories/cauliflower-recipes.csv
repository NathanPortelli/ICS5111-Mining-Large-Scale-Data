Trim off the white part of the leek (putting the green top aside for later), add to the bowl and cook in the microwave on high (800W) for 10 minutes, or until the cauliflower is defrosted and the leek has softened., Meanwhile, place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Peel, finely slice and stir in 1 clove of garlic and cook for 2 minutes, or until golden, then very finely slice and add the green leek top. Roughly chop the bread to create rustic breadcrumbs, add to the pan and fry for 5 minutes, or until starting to crisp up, stirring occasionally. Finely chop and add the nuts, stirring until toasted, then transfer everything to a plate., Return the pan to the heat with 1 teaspoon of oil. Peel, finely slice and add the remaining garlic and fry for 2 minutes, or until golden. Slice and add the softened white part of the leek, then stir through the dried thyme and softened cauliflower., Stir the flour into the pan, then gradually add the milk, a ladleful at a time, stirring continuously until you have a smooth sauce. Remove from the heat, then either blitz it with a hand blender until silky smooth, or use a potato masher to mash everything together to create a rustic sauce. Grate in most of the cheese, stirring gently to combine., Cook the pasta in a pan of salted boiling water according to the packet instructions, then drag it straight into the sauce, taking a little cooking water with it. Toss together, adding a splash of starchy cooking water to loosen, if needed., Divide between plates, sprinkling over the crispy breadcrumbs and grating over the reserved cheese, to serve."

                                                 , or more or less as required","Slice up the cauliflower into chunks or 1-inch thick steaks, reserving the leaves and any tiny florets and trimmings. Roughly chop up the leaves into ½cm pieces, discarding any thick woody stems., Mix 5 tablespoons of oil with 1 teaspoon each of turmeric and chilli powder, along with 1 tablespoon of curry powder and ½ a teaspoon of salt. Rub this marinade all over the steaks, reserving a small amount to lightly toss through the leaves and florets., Air-fry the steaks at 190°C for 15 minutes, until cooked through. If your air-fryer has a basket rather than shelves, you should turn the steaks over halfway through cooking. If after 15 minutes you need more colour on the cauliflower, raise the temperature to 200°C and cook for an extra 4 to 6 minutes., Meanwhile, mix the flour, salt, sliced red onion, chopped curry leaves and coconut milk together in a large mixing bowl and gradually add warm water, a little at a time as required, to bring together as a cohesive dough that is soft, but does not stick to your hands. The dough should have the consistency of playdough. Knead for about 3 minutes by hand until it all comes together. Leave to rest at room temperature, covered with a damp towel for about 10 minutes., Lay the florets and leaves on parchment and cook for 8 to 10 minutes at 200°C to crisp them up, then leave them aside (this can be done along with the steaks if you have a multi-level air-fryer) while you make the curry., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the cinnamon stick and cumin seeds to it. Fry for 20 to 30 seconds, being careful not to burn the delicate seeds., Add the onion and garlic along with a pinch of salt and cook on a medium-low heat until they are very soft and translucent, approximately 10 to 12 minutes., Now add the curry leaves (along with the stalks and all) and remaining ground spices. Fry for 20 seconds and then add the coconut milk. Add the frozen peas to the sauce and simmer for 5 to 8 minutes on a medium heat, then season with salt and sugar to your taste., To make the rotis, divide the dough into 4 balls and roll out into discs approximately 5mm thick. I prefer a slightly rough, natural look rather than perfect circles, the key is to ensure they are of the same thickness across to ensure they cook evenly., Heat a dry non-stick pan over a high heat and then reduce heat to medium and cook the rotis for 4 to 6 minutes, flipping halfway through. The key is not to use oil or fat when cooking the rotis and to cook them on a hot dry pan, so they roast as opposed to fry., Pour the sauce over the cauliflower steaks just before serving, garnish with the florets and serve with the warm rotis on the side."

Finely grate over the lemon zest and squeeze in the juice., Peel and quarter one of the onions, then break into petals. Deseed and roughly tear the peppers into similar-sized chunks, then place it all into the roasting tray with the whole chillies., Break the cauliflower into florets and cut the paneer into 2.5cm cubes, then add to the tray and toss everything together. Thread the ingredients onto skewers (soaked, if wooden), alternating them as you go., Preheat the grill to full whack, then cook the skewers for 15 minutes, or until golden and gnarly, turning regularly., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, pick in the curry leaves and fry until crispy, then remove to a plate, leaving the flavoured oil behind., Peel and roughly chop the remaining onion, as well as the garlic and ginger. Place in the pan with the garam masala, paprika and almonds and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened. Tip into a blender with the tinned tomatoes and blitz to a smooth sauce., Pour the sauce back into the pan, add the chickpeas, most of the coconut milk and the mango chutney, then season to perfection and simmer for 10 minutes, or until thickened., Meanwhile, make the salad. Trim the carrots, cucumber and cabbages as necessary, then coarsely grate on a box grater. Peel and finely grate the ginger, then place it all on a platter, squeeze over the lime juice and pick over the coriander leaves., To make the pancakes, combine the flour and 1 mug of water in a bowl with the mustard seeds. Grate in the creamed coconut and whisk well. Place a small non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, rub with a little groundnut oil, then pour in a thin layer of batter, swirling it up and around the edges. Cook on one side only for 2 minutes, or until lightly golden, then stack up on a serving plate and repeat with the remaining batter., Cut the paneer and veg from the skewers straight into the curry, simmer for a further 10 minutes, then drizzle over the remaining coconut milk and sprinkle with the crispy curry leaves. Toss the salad together, then bring everything to the table, and tuck in."

I’ve also added a curveball ingredient inspired by a trip to Delhi, where I saw street-food vendors doing the most incredible things with poppadoms. This is food that just makes me happy.   ”",279,13.1g,2.2g,7.5g,4.5g,7.9g,33.3g,1g,"2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onions, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                head of                                                                                                                                                                cauliflower                                                                                                                                                                , (800g), 3                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                tikka curry paste, 1                                                                                                                                                                mug of                                                                                                                                                                basmati rice                                                                                                                                                                , (300g), 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    fresh mixed-colour chillies, 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                    uncooked poppadoms, 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                coriander                                                                                                                                                                , (30g), 6                                                                                                                                                                 tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                natural yoghurt, extra virgin olive oil",

Cook for 15 minutes, or until golden and crisp, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, peel the onion, then roughly chop with the cauliflower, stalk and all., Tip the crispy crumbs into a bowl, returning the pan to the heat. Pour in the milk and add the chopped veg, bring just to the boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer., Alongside, cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions. Just before the pasta is ready, carefully pour the cauliflower mixture into the processor (there’s no need to wash it), grate in the cheese, blitz until super smooth, then season to perfection, and return to the pan. Drain the pasta, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water., Toss the pasta through the sauce, loosening with a splash of reserved cooking water, if needed, then serve with the crispy crumbs, for sprinkling."

casserole pan on a medium heat with the butter., Trim, halve, wash and slice the leek and add to the pan. Stir regularly while you trim, slice and add the celery, then trim, chop and add the fennel, if using., Break the cauliflower into florets, then cut into 2cm-thick slices and finely slice the stalk and any nice leaves. Add the stalk and leaves to the pan and cook for 10 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water for 8 minutes (5 if using macaroni). Reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water, drain the pasta and pour into a 25cm x 35cm baking dish (or divide between smaller ones), along with the cauliflower florets., Stir the flour into the veg pan for 30 seconds, then gradually pour in the milk, stirring all the time, followed by 500ml of water. Simmer for 5 minutes, then stir in the mustard and season with sea salt and black pepper., Let the sauce blip away until thickened while you coarsely grate the cheese., Stir the cheese into the sauce, then blitz until smooth with a hand blender, or in batches in a food processor., Pour over the pasta and cauliflower florets then, if you need to loosen it, add a little reserved pasta water – the sauce will thicken up as it bakes., Blitz your stale bread into crumbs in the processor (or smash up in a clean tea towel). Peel and grate the garlic. Pick the herb leaves, if using, and mix it all together with 1 tablespoon of olive oil., Scatter the crumbs over the pasta, grating over more cheese, if you’ve got it, then bake for 30 minutes, or until golden and bubbling."

The recipe has been written to be flexible and scalable up to 50 portions. Note: all veg weights are for trimmed, prepped vegetables., Preheat the oven 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Break the cauliflower and broccoli into florets., Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, adding the cauliflower and broccoli for the last 4 minutes, then drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water., Remove and discard any tough stalky bits from the leafy greens, then chop into bite-sized pieces., Place a pan large enough to hold all the ingredients on a medium heat with the olive oil. Add the greens and cook for 3 minutes or until wilted., Add the white sauce, mustard (if using) and pasta and veg. Grate over the cheese and give everything a good mix, adding a splash of cooking water to loosen. Season to taste., Transfer to a large, deep baking tray (60x40cm)., Tear the bread (if using) into small chunks and whiz in a food processor to chunky crumbs. Scatter the breadcrumbs over the pasta and season with a little black pepper., Bake for 10 minutes or until golden and bubbling."

Add to the pan, pick in the oregano leaves and cook for 5 minutes, or until just starting to soften and colour., Quarter and add the tomatoes, then season to taste with sea salt and black pepper., Pour 500ml of water into the pan and bring to the boil, stirring well and scraping up any sticky bits from the bottom., Discard just the tatty outer leaves from the cauliflower, then cut a cross into the stalk and push it right down to the bottom of the pan., Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, cover, then place in the oven for 1 hour, or until golden and caramelised, basting occasionally and removing the lid halfway through., Remove the cauliflower to a serving platter and pick out the garlic bulb, then place the pan back over a medium heat on the hob, stir in the peas or broad beans, and simmer for 5 minutes., Carefully squeeze all the garlic out of the skins and stir back into the pan. Taste and tweak the seasoning, if needed, then pour over the cauliflower and finish with a good squeeze of lemon juice."

Mix up as best you can, then knead vigorously on a flour-dusted surface to give you a smooth, elastic dough. Rub lightly with oil, place in the bowl, cover with a clean damp tea towel and prove for 1 hour in a warm place, or until doubled in size., Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the onion and place in a pan with the butter, bay leaves and a splash of water. Fry on a medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring regularly, then stir in 50g of flour, followed by the mustard, and slowly add the milk to give you a loose white sauce. Roughly break up the cauliflower, discarding just the tatty outer leaves, and finely slice the stalk. Add to the pan with any remaining leaves. Simmer gently for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat, grate in the cheese, season to perfection and allow to cool a little., Preheat the oven to full whack (240ºC/475ºF/gas 9). Lightly oil a 30cm non-stick ovenproof frying pan or a 25cm x 35cm baking tray, then press out the dough to fill the space. Spoon over the cauliflower mixture, leaving a 2cm border around the edge, then leave to prove again until doubled in size. Bake at the bottom of the oven for 25 minutes, or until golden, crisp and melty., Delicious served with a bowl of lemony dressed seasonal salad leaves."

Slice each half into 3 chunky slices, then place into a large ovenproof pan (30cm), ideally in one layer., Rub 2 heaped tablespoons of rogan josh paste over the cauliflower, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Tear the cauliflower leaves into the pan, then place over a medium heat on the hob. Pour in 500ml of water, so it’s just level with the cauliflower., Peel 1 red onion, cut into quarters and break apart into petals, then peel and finely slice 2 cloves of garlic, and place on top of the cauliflower. Bring to the boil, then leave to bubble away for 10 minutes., Transfer the pan to under the grill, roughly 5cm from the heat, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until gnarly, charred and cooked through, turning halfway., Meanwhile, cook 150g of basmati rice in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instruction with ½ a lemon thrown in, then drain., Remove the pips and any pith from the cooked lemon, then very finely chop the flesh and rind. Pick the coriander leaves from 1 sprig and scatter over with a few pickled chillies (if using) and a splash of the pickling liquor, and finely chop and mix together. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, then put aside until needed., Remove the cauliflower pan from under the grill, place over a medium heat, then pour in ½ x 400g tin of light coconut milk and bring to the boil, stirring gently to combine – try not to break up the cauliflower slices., One-by-one, puff up the 4 uncooked poppadoms in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute each., Pick the remaining leaves from the ½ bunch of fresh coriander (15g) and put aside, adding the stalks to a pestle and mortar with a pinch each of salt and chilli flakes.

Pick the thyme leaves., Trim and slice three-quarters of the mushrooms. Trim the cauliflower, remove and discard the leaves, then chop the cauliflower florets and stalk into small chunks., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wide saucepan on a medium heat, add the garlic, onion, chilli and thyme, then cook gently for 10 minutes, or until golden., Add the sliced mushrooms and cauliflower, cover with a lid and cook gently for about 10 minutes, or until softened., Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until al dente – this means it’s cooked, but still has a bit of bite., Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley leaves. Trim and very finely slice the remaining mushrooms., Once softened, mash the cauliflower mixture with a fork until broken down, but still with a bit of texture. Stir in the ricotta, then season to taste with sea salt, black pepper and the juice from half the lemon., Reserving a cupful of the cooking water, drain the pasta and return it to the pan, off the heat. Tip in the sauce and stir well, adding splashes of the cooking water to loosen, if needed. Taste and season with salt, pepper and the remaining lemon juice., Stir in the sliced raw mushrooms, most of the Parmesan cheese and half of the parsley leaves. Serve with the remaining chopped parsley and cheese sprinkled on top."

Squeeze the garlic out of its skins and add them too. Pour in the coconut milk, add the stock and gently bring to the boil., Reduce the heat a little and simmer for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat. Using a stick blender, blitz the soup until creamy and smooth, adding a splash more water if it is too thick., Taste and adjust the seasoning, and serve topped with the toasted coconut flakes and a drizzle of chilli oil."
Chickpea stew recipe | Jamie Oliver chickpea recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/46337837.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",In40 minutes,"“This is a delicious dish with great depth of flavour. I’ve used spices and ingredients that might make you think of Morocco or Tunisia – cinnamon and chilli, dried fruit and even couscous – but because North Africa is so close to Sicily, their styles of cooking can be surprisingly similar. Cauliflower is super-high in both vitamin C and folic acid, both of which help our brains to think properly. Along with protein-rich chickpeas and wholewheat couscous, which is higher in fibre than regular couscous, I’ve packed this dinner with plenty of nutritious goodness.

Slice and add the anchovies, along with the yoghurt, mustard and Worcestershire sauce., Squeeze in half the lemon juice, add 1 tablespoon of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and mix to make your dressing., Now you’re going to turn regular salad into a thing of beauty by either taking your time with good knife skills, or ideally, investing in a mandolin for ease, elegance and accuracy (use the guard!). Start by peeling and very finely slicing the red onion, then stir it through the dressing., Click off and discard any tatty outer leaves from the cauliflower, then very finely slice it. Finely slice the lettuce by hand and pile both on top of the dressed onion, tossing together only moments before serving., Put 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. Pick the rosemary leaves over the chicken and lightly season it on both sides, flattening it slightly with the heel of your hand. Cook for 4 minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through., Cube the bread and toast alongside the chicken, moving regularly until evenly golden and gnarly, removing only when super-crispy., Toss the salad together and season to perfection, slice up the chicken and serve with a sprinkling of croutons and lemon wedges for squeezing over."

chopping board, carefully halve the rolls across the middle using a bread knife, to give you a top and a base for each. Put to one side., Using an eating knife, cut each radish in half lengthways, then slice each radish half into 3 pieces and place into a large bowl., Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, scoop out the watery seeds with a teaspoon and discard. Slice each cucumber half into 4 pieces, then add to the bowl., Trim the carrot, then cut into 8 even-sized pieces and add to the bowl., Click apart the cauliflower florets and place into the bowl with the stalks., Pull out the pepper’s stalk, tearing out the core, then discard. Scoop out the seeds and white pith with a teaspoon, then discard. Cut the pepper into 4 slices, then cut each slice into 4 pieces. Add the pieces to the bowl., Remove the core from the apple half and place, flat-side down, on the board. Cut it into 6 even-sized pieces, then add to the bowl., Place a clean tea towel onto the chopping board and place the vegetables and chopped apple in a pile in the middle., Fold over each corner of the tea towel so your ingredients are wrapped up like a parcel – make sure there are no gaps to stop the vegetables from escaping., Carefully crush and squash the vegetables with a rolling pin until broken down into little pieces. Open up the parcel – if your pieces are still too big, wrap it back up and crush and squash again., Measure the balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil into the empty bowl to make your dressing., Pick the herb leaves, discarding the stalks. Tear the leaves into small pieces, adding them to the bowl as you go., Using scissors, snip the cress or sprouting herbs into the bowl, then add the peas and sunflower seeds., Add the squashed vegetables to the bowl, then using the tips of your fingers, carefully toss them in the dressing so they’re nicely coated., Spread the base of each roll with the cottage or cream cheese, then spread the soft side of each top with the houmous., Divide the vegetable mixture equally between the base of each roll. Place the lids on top, houmous-side down, press lightly, then tuck in!, Jamie's top tip: When beetroot is in season, I like to add it here for extra colour and flavour. Feel free to swap in your own favourite seasonal veg – just make sure it has a bit of crunch!"

combine the flour, baking powder, a good pinch of sea salt and the ajwain seeds (if using) in a large bowl., Use your fingers to rub in 120ml of oil until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in 150ml of cold water, then bring it together with your hands into a rough dough, adding a splash more water, if needed., Place in a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 30 minutes., Peel and chop the potatoes into rough 2.5cm chunks, then break the cauliflower into florets so they’re roughly the same size., Add the potatoes to a large pan of boiling salted water and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until tender, adding the cauliflower after 3 minutes. Add the peas for the final minute, then drain., Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then peel and finely grate the ginger. Deseed and finely chop the chilli., Drizzle a lug of oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, add the cumin and onion and cook for 8 minutes, or until softened but not coloured. Stir in the garlic, ginger and chilli, then fry for a further few minutes., Bash the fennel seeds to a fine powder and add to the pan along with the garam masala and ground coriander. Stir well., Stir the cooked veg into the pan and crush gently with a potato masher – don't overdo it: you want a fairly chunky mixture. Squeeze in the lemon juice and season to taste. Leave to cool, then pick, finely chop and stir in the coriander leaves., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Lightly grease a large baking tray with oil., On a flour-dusted surface, halve the dough and roll out each portion to about 3cm thick. Using a 7cm pastry cutter, stamp out as many circles as you can, then roll into rounds, roughly ½cm thick and 18cm in diameter., Cut each round in half, then brush the straight edges with a little water. Roll into a cone shape, bringing the straight edges together and pressing lightly to seal., Spoon in the filling, brush the exposed dough with a little water, then fold over and press to seal. Place onto the prepared baking tray, then repeat with the remaining ingredients, keeping the samosas covered with a damp tea towel as you go., Brush the samosas with a little oil and bake for 45 minutes, or until golden and piping hot through. Serve straightaway with mango chutney."

Scrunch over the toasted almonds, then pick, roughly chop and scatter the parsley leaves on top., Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, then carve up and serve with pilaf rice and steamed greens, or as part of a bigger spread."

Season well and mix together gently., Roast for 25 to 30 minutes, until the florets and sprouts are tender and starting to caramelise. You may find that the loose sprout leaves start to really crisp up; don’t be alarmed, it adds a lovely smoky element to the overall flavour., Transfer the roasted cauliflower and sprouts to a serving bowl and add the pine nuts and raisins. Season to taste, then give the whole mixture a gentle stir to ensure everything is combined and coated in the saffron oil, and then serve."

chapati flour in a large bowl with ¾ teaspoon salt and about 200ml cold water, then knead for 10–12 minutes. Shape into a ball, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest., Heat most of the vegetable oil in a pan over a medium heat and sauté the onion, garlic and ginger, stirring, for 6–8 minutes, until softening. With a slotted spoon, remove the onion mixture to a bowl and set aside., Toast the mustard and cumin seeds in a dry pan over a medium heat for 30 seconds, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until fragrant. Transfer to a large saucepan with the rest of the vegetable oil, tomatoes, curry leaves and remaining spices. Cook for a further 5 minutes over a medium heat., Add the reserved onion mixture, potatoes and chillies and season generously with salt and pepper. Pour in about 600ml water, or enough to just cover the mixture. Bring to a simmer over a low heat, cover with a lid and continue to simmer for 8–10 minutes. Add the cauliflower and cook for another 8–10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the potatoes and cauliflower are tender., Meanwhile, cook the parathas. Place a flat, cast-iron, Indian-style tava over a medium-high heat. If you don’t have one of these, use a frying pan or flat griddle. Divide the dough into 6–8 balls. Lightly flour a flat surface and roll the first ball into a 12cm circle. Lightly brush with the melted butter and place on the hot tava or pan. Cook for a few minutes on each side, or until the bread begins to blacken and blister. Repeat with the remaining dough., Serve immediately with the curry and a bowl of yoghurt on the side."

half into wedges for serving later, then squeeze the juice of the other half on to a large plate and add 1 tablespoon of tikka paste., Mix together, then massage all over the frozen fish and leave aside in a single layer to marinate and defrost., Peel and slice the onion, garlic and ginger with the chilli and coriander stalks, then place it all in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with a lug of oil and the remaining tikka paste., Peel the potatoes, cut them into 2cm chunks, then stir them into the pan and cook everything for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally. This will build up great flavour., Quarter the tomatoes, add to the pan with the cauliflower, lentils and 600ml of boiling water, and bring back to the boil. Simmer for 45 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through and the sauce is lovely and thick, adding splashes of water, if needed, then season to perfection., Around 15 minutes before the curry is ready, put 1 mug (320g) of rice and 2 mugs of boiling water into a pan with a pinch of sea salt and the cloves. Cook on a medium heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed., Dry-fry the fish in a large non-stick pan for 3 to 5 minutes per side (depending on the thickness), or until charred, gnarly and cooked through – don’t be tempted to move it around, just let it colour and crisp up nicely., Stir half the yoghurt through the curry and dollop the remaining yoghurt on top. Fluff up the rice, flake the fish on top, then sprinkle with coriander leaves and serve alongside the curry, with lemon wedges for squeezing over."

fresh red chilli","Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Separate and peel the garlic cloves, then peel and roughly chop the onion. Pick the coriander leaves (reserve for later) and roughly chop the stalks., Put the coriander stalks, garlic and onion in a blender with the rest of the paste ingredients and whiz until smooth, then scrape the paste out into a bowl., Roughly chop the tomatoes and put in the blender, season well with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, then blitz until smooth and put aside for later., Remove and discard the cauliflower leaves, break off the florets and slice the stalk. Peel and roughly slice the onions., Toss the cauliflower and red onions into a large casserole-type pan, with half the curry paste. Add 600ml of water and roast in the hot oven for 40 minutes, stirring halfway through., Meanwhile, cut the chicken into finger-sized strips, toss them in the bowl with the remaining curry paste, cover and pop into the fridge., After 40 minutes, carefully move the hot pan from the oven to the hob. Drain and add the chickpeas, along with the stock and blitzed  tomatoes, and simmer on a medium heat for about 30 minutes, or until the consistency you like., Meanwhile, preheat a large griddle pan over a high heat. Thread the chicken pieces on to 6 or 8 metal or wooden skewers. Drizzle with a little oil, season from a height, and cook on the screaming hot griddle for around 10 to 12 minutes, turning each one every now and again, until gnarly, sizzly and cooked through. Squeeze over some lemon juice and give the pan a good shake, scraping the bottom of the pan for around 30 seconds to get all the intense flavour. Transfer everything to a plate and set aside., Go back to your curry and mash a few times to thicken up the sauce. Add the delicate veggies (peas, beans, corn and spinach) for the last 3 minutes of cooking, then have a taste and correct the seasoning., Deseed and finely chop the chilli, if using, leaving in the seeds for extra heat., Marble a few dollops of yoghurt, if using, through the sauce, scatter over the reserved coriander leaves and the chilli, then take straight to the table.

Bring back to the boil for 1 minute, then remove the florets with a slotted spoon and leave in a colander. Keep the cauliflower water to one side., Heat a wide pan big enough to hold all the ingredients at once. Add a good splash of vegetable oil and when it’s hot, add the mustard seeds, the asafoetida, the curry leaves and turmeric. Fry for a few seconds then add the diced potatoes, just enough of the cauliflower water to cover them and some salt. Cover with a lid and simmer gently until the potatoes are just cooked. Add the peas, chillies and cauliflower florets, stir and replace the lid. Cook over a gentle heat until everything is cooked and soft, and the liquid has reduced. Taste and season well with salt and pepper, sprinkle with loads of chopped coriander and some coconut shavings and serve."

I use my regular porridge-for-four-people pan and it works a treat! Add the onion, garlic, chopped cauliflower stalk and a lug of oil to the pan and slowly fry for 10 minutes until softened and with a little colour. Add the olives, anchovies and parsley stalks and fry for another couple of minutes. Add your tomatoes, then half-fill one of the tins with water and add that to the pan, with a good swig of red wine vinegar. Stir everything together, breaking the tomatoes down with a spoon to make sure there are no big lumps, and bring to the boil., Take your cauliflower and gently push it down into the sauce. If you’ve got the size of your pan right, half of the cauliflower will be in the sauce, half above it. Drizzle with olive oil, put the lid on and let it tick over on a low heat for 50 minutes. Serve sprinkled with the parsley leaves. Again, this is a pretty well-behaved dish when it comes to cooking it in advance and then reheating it just before you want to serve it. Lovely with roast lamb, and it’s also a delicious main course for a vegetarian if you leave out the anchovies."

Blanch the cauliflower in salted boiling water for a couple of minutes then drain in a colander, allowing it to steam dry (you don't want any water left in your cauliflower or it won't roast properly). Toss it in a good lug of olive oil and the butter. In a pestle and mortar, bash your spices and chillies with a pinch of salt, then mix them with your almonds and put in a hot, dry ovenproof pan to slowly toast them. After a couple of minutes, add the cauliflower. When it gets a nice bit of colour on it, add the lemon zest and juice and mix around well. Fry for about a minute longer then pop the pan into the preheated oven for about 15 minutes to crisp up."

Smash up the cumin and mustard seeds, chillies and peppercorns in a pestle and mortar until you have a powder. Put the flour into a mixing bowl and stir in the ground spices and the turmeric., Pour in most of the beer and whisk gently. Check the consistency – you want it to be the thickness of double cream. If it’s too thick, whisk in the rest of the beer. Don’t worry too much about having little lumps in the batter, as they’ll just become nice crunchy bits when you start frying. Season with sea salt and put to one side., Trim the bottom off the stalk and break the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Slice up the stalk into 2cm pieces – this way it will all cook at the same rate. Place the cauliflower pieces in a bowl and dust with a little flour., Pour the oil into a deep saucepan – you want it to be about 10–12cm deep – and heat it to 180°C. If you don’t have a thermometer don't worry, just drop a piece of potato into the oil. When it floats to the surface and starts to sizzle, the oil will be at the right temperature so remove the potato from the pan., Shake any excess flour off the cauliflower. One by one, dip the pieces into the beer batter, then carefully place them in the hot oil, moving them away from you as you do so. Make sure you stand back so you don’t get splashed. It’s best to fry them in batches so you don’t overcrowd the pan (but serve them as soon as each batch is ready)., Each time a batch of cauliflower is nearly ready, add some battered parsley leaves to the pan and fry for 40 seconds (you want to serve them scattered over the fritters). Fry the pieces gently, turning them a couple of times with a slotted spoon., When they’re browned and crisp, lift them out of the oil, allowing any excess to drip back into the pan, and drain on kitchen paper. Dust with sea salt and squeeze over a little lemon juice."
