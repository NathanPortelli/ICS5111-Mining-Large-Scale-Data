Peel and smash in the garlic, muddle in 2 tablespoons each of oil and red wine vinegar, then season with black pepper., Rub the paste all over the pork, getting it into all the nooks and crannies, then cover and pop in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Place a large sheet of greaseproof paper on a flat surface and rub lightly with oil. Arrange the Coppa di Parma on the paper, slightly overlapping, to make a large square., Place the pork at one end and roll it up tightly in the Coppa, using the paper to help you. Carefully remove the paper and secure the pork all the way along with butcher’s string., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil and the butter, add the pork and brown all over, turning with tongs., Peel the onion and cut into eighths, and trim and roughly chop the celery, adding to the pan as you go. Strip in 2 sprigs of the rosemary, then pour in most of the wine and let it bubble and cook away for 1 minute., Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning and basting every 10 minutes, and adding the last of the Chianti towards the end., Meanwhile, scrub both celeriac, then carefully peel the knobbly skin with a sharp knife. Place the peelings in a roasting tray, toss with 1 tablespoon of oil and a little salt and pepper, then pop in the bottom of the oven with the pork., Chop the rest of the celeriac into rough 2cm chunks, then place in a large casserole pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Pick in the thyme leaves, then cook with the lid on for 30 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally and adding splashes of water, if needed., To make the compote, trim and chop the rhubarb into 5cm chunks and place in a roasting tray. Core the apples, cut into wedges and place in the tray, then add a pinch of pepper, the sugar, butter and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar. Drop in the remaining rosemary sprig, then place in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until you’re able to mash the fruit slightly., Remove the pork from the oven and let it rest in its juices while the fruit and celeriac finish cooking., Carve the pork (discard the string) and serve with the fruit compote, celeriac and crispy celeriac crackling, spooning over the pan juices. Delicious served with seasonal steamed greens."

Once golden, remove the sausages to a plate, put the leek and apple into the pan and strip in most of the thyme. Add a splash of water, season with sea salt and black pepper, then cover and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally., Drain the potatoes, mash with half the flour, then season to perfection. Lightly rub a 20cm x 28cm baking dish with oil. Once the mash is cool enough to handle, use your fingertips to spread two thirds of it evenly across the base and sides of the dish., Stir the remaining flour into the leeks, then gradually stir in the milk, then the mustard. Simmer for 5 minutes, or until thick and creamy., Slice the sausages 1cm thick and stir most of them into the pan, along with any juices, then evenly spoon into the mash-lined dish., Press the remaining mash on to a sheet of greaseproof paper until just bigger than your dish, then flip over the top of the dish, peel off the paper, trim any excess and crimp the edges with a fork to seal., Poke the reserved sausage slices into the top, then gently brush with 1 tablespoon of oil. Bake at the bottom of the oven for 40 minutes, or until golden, adding the remaining thyme leaves for the last 5 minutes."

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 3 hours with a lid on top. It’s very important to remember to keep checking the pan, as you don’t want it to boil dry – otherwise the tins will explode. It will give you the most amazing toffee. Put the tins to one side and allow to cool., To make the pastry, score the vanilla pod lengthways (if using), and scape out the seeds (keep the pod for making vanilla sugar)., Cream the butter, icing sugar and a small pinch of sea salt together, then rub in the flour. Add the vanilla seeds, finely grate in the lemon zest and add the egg yolks – you can do all this by hand or in a food processor., When the mixture looks like coarse breadcrumbs, add the cold milk (or use water)., Pat and gently work the mixture together until you have a ball of dough, then flour it lightly and roll into a large sausage shape – don’t work the pastry too much otherwise it will become elastic and chewy, not flaky and short as you want it to be., Wrap the dough in clingfilm and place in the fridge to rest for at least 1 hour., Remove it from the fridge, slice it up and line a 28cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Push the slices together, then tidy up the sides by trimming off any excess. Place the tart mould into the freezer for 1 hour., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4, then take the pastry case out of the freezer and bake for 15 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly., Peel and quarter the apples and remove the cores, then finely slice and toss in the icing sugar., Spread the caramel from both tins over the pastry case. Place the apples on top and pour any remaining juices over., Bake at the bottom of the oven for 40 minutes, to give you a crisp base and bubbling toffee over the apples. Serve with yoghurt or vanilla ice cream. Beautiful!"

sugar, 1 big pinch of sea salt, half the cardamom and half the ground cinnamon., Add the egg yolks and whisk, pouring in the lager as you go, until you have a smooth, thick batter; cover and set aside to rest., Peel and core the apples, before cutting them into ½-centimetre thick slices, then set aside in a bowl of water until needed., Mix the remaining 5 tablespoons of caster sugar with the rest of the cardamom and cinnamon, and 1 pinch of salt., Heat the oil in a wide, deep, heavy-based pan (no more than half full),  to 190ºC/375ºF (use a thermometer, or drop in a piece of bread: it should turn golden in about 35 seconds), or use a deep-fat fryer., Dunk the apple slices in the batter and fry, in batches, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until crisp and a rich brown colour, turning regularly. Drain on a rack with kitchen paper underneath to catch the drips. Cool briefly, then toss in the spiced sugar., Snap the chocolate into a saucepan with all the other sauce ingredients and 1 pinch of salt. Melt over a medium-low heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until smooth and pourable., Serve the sauce immediately, alongside the warm fritters for dipping."

¼ of a teaspoon of sea salt, then pulse until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs., Finely grate the lemon zest and reserve for later, then squeeze in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, add the egg yolk and 2 tablespoons of cold water, and pulse to combine. If the mixture still looks dry, keep adding water and pulsing until the dough comes together., Divide the dough in two, shape into equal-sized discs, wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 1 hour to firm up., For the filling, peel and core the apples, cut into 1cm wedges and place in a saucepan. Sprinkle over the reserved lemon zest and squeeze in the remaining juice., Finely chop the dates, removing any pits, then stir in with the sugar and spices. Gently simmer over a medium-low heat for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the apples are almost tender. Set aside to cool., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Roll  one of the pastry discs out to 5mm thick on a clean, floured surface and use it to line a deep 20cm pie dish, pushing the pastry into the edges. Trim the edges, leaving a 2.5cm overhang around the dish. Spoon in the cooled pie filling, packing it tightly., Roll the second pastry disc out to 5mm thick, brush the edges with water and place over the pie, pressing the edges to seal. Fold in the overhang and crimp with your fingers., For the glaze, beat all the ingredients together in a small bowl, then brush all over the pie. If you have any off-cuts of pastry, you could make extra decorations for the top, sealing with extra glaze., Using a sharp knife, make incisions into the pie top to allow steam to escape during baking. Sprinkle with extra demerara sugar., Bake the pie for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and firm. Delicious served  warm, with pouring cream or lashings of custard."

Trim and chop the celery sticks. Pick the thyme leaves and discard the stalks., Tip the chopped veggies, apple and garlic into the casserole dish along with the thyme, and cook for 10 minutes over a medium heat until golden and starting to soften., Drain the soaked haricot beans and add to the dish, along with the cider, chicken stock, tomato purée and the browned duck., Bring to the boil, then transfer the dish to the oven, covering loosely with foil, and cook for 2 hours to 2 hours 30 minutes, or until the duck is tender., After 1 hour, check the duck, give it a stir and add a little seasoning plus some stock or water if it’s looking dry., Meanwhile, peel the garlic for the crumb topping, and pick the parsley leaves, discarding the stalks. Blitz the bread, garlic and parsley in a food processor until fine., When the duck is done, remove from the oven and sprinkle with the crumb mix, reserving a little to serve. Drizzle over 1 tablespoon of the reserved duck fat (or use olive oil)., Return to the oven, uncovered, for 10 minutes, until golden on top.

Stir and fry for 2 minutes, then finely grate in the clementine zest and squeeze in the juice., Add the vinegar, cabbage and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Cook with a lid ajar on a low heat for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cooked through and a pleasure to eat, stirring well every 5 minutes to help intensify and mix up the flavours., Serve sprinkled with the crispy bacon and rosemary leaves."

Put the currants in a bowl, cover with warm water and leave to soak., Melt the butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then add to the pan and sauté for 8 to 10 minutes, or until softened. Meanwhile, peel core and dice the apples, then remove the crusts from the bread and blitz to breadcrumbs., Add the apple to the pan and allow to soften. Pick the thyme and sage leaves straight into the pan, then drain the currants and add to the pan along with the breadcrumbs. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the bread is golden brown, then remove from the pan and set aside to cool., Place the pork loin on a wooden board. Score the skin with a sharp knife in a criss-cross pattern. Next, butterfly the loin by laying it, skin-side down, on your board and making a slice down one side of the pork, where the skin slightly comes away from flesh. Continue to make long slices all the way down the pork and slowly roll it out until the end, almost like unrolling a carpet., Spread the cooled stuffing mixture over the flesh and season well with sea salt and black pepper. Gently roll the loin back into its original form, ending up with the cut side on the bottom and the skin on top., Tightly tie 3 or 4 pieces of string around the pork to make sure no stuffing leaks out. Season the skin., Place in a roasting tin, add the cider and 200ml of water and pop in the oven for 15 minutes, before turning down to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 and cooking for 1 to 1¼ hours. Trim and wash the leeks, then chop into large chunks. Shred the cabbage and add to the roasting tin along with the leek chunks for the last 45 minutes."

Halve the passion fruit and scrape in the pulp, then add the oil and mix together., Finely slice the cabbage, discarding the core. Remove the woody ends from the asparagus, then finely slice along with the trimmed spring onions and celery. Peel and coarsely grate the apple and carrot., Pop all the shredded fruit and veg into a large bowl. Pour over the dressing, mix well and season to taste., Enjoy straight away, or better still, cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 days so the veggies soften slightly and the flavours mingle and develop. Mix well before serving and spoon over a little extra passion-fruit pulp, top with shredded spring onions and sprinkle with poppy seeds."

Divide the mince into 4 portions and work each ball in your hands for a few minutes to melt the fat and mould them into a relatively smooth, round patty. Make them slightly bigger than your bun, as they will shrink when cooked., Pop them on a tray, cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge., When you're ready to cook your burgers, get your toppings ready. Pick off, wash and spin dry the lettuce leaves, cut your cress, slice the apples, crumble the blue cheese into chunks, and leave everything to one side., Preheat your grill to high. Pop a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a drizzle of oil to the pan., Fry the burgers for around 4 minutes on each side if you like them pink in the middle, or longer if you prefer them fully cooked, seasoning the patties with black pepper as you cook them., Halve and toast the buns under the grill or on a hot griddle, then line them up on a board ready to go., When the burgers are cooked, top each with the blue cheese and pop under the grill for a couple of minutes until nice and oozy., Now build your burgers. First layer the salad leaves and apple onto the buns, followed by a good drizzle of mustard., Pop the burgers on, and top with the cress (a cucumber and chilli relish is great here too). Squish the bun tops on and serve straight away."

 juice lemon","To make a rub, bash all the spices together with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper in a pestle and mortar till fine (or use a blender). Muddle in 2 tablespoons of olive oil., Trim the fat off the pork, then rub the spice mix over the pork and marinate for 1 hour., Light your barbecue and let it calm down. Make sure you’ve got your coals high on one side and low on the other for control., Grill the pork for 5 to 10 minutes, using tongs to turn it till charred all over. Fat will render out, so keep it moving to avoid any flames., Once it’s looking beautiful, move it to the cool side of the barbecue, cover with tin foil and cook for 45 to 60 minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes – you should get gnarly pork that’s beautifully cooked. Check it by cutting in half and looking, or use a meat thermometer and stop when it reaches 72ºC inside – you don’t want it pink but please don’t cook the hell out of it either., Meanwhile, for the sauce, mix all the ingredients together. Taste it, and tweak the flavours until it tastes right for you. Whatever vibe you’re going for, you want to go slightly too far as it will mellow when it cooks. You don’t have to, but it’s nice to put it on the heat for a couple of minutes to help it along., For the salad, pick and finely slice all the herbs. Scrub the beetroot and shred the cabbage. Finely slice the chillies (if using)., Add the herbs to a large serving bowl. Thinly slice your beets and apples (core and all), then finely slice into matchsticks (a food processor will do a fine job)., Put these in the bowl, along with the chilli (if using), and add a squeeze of lemon juice., Just before serving, pour on the extra virgin olive oil, squeeze over the rest of the lemon juice and add a good pinch of pepper. Toss it all together, then have a taste and season to perfection, if needed., Brush half the sauce all over the pork so it’s shiny and dark, and cook for the final few minutes till it sizzles., Put it back on the hot side if it needs help to get sticky, but don’t let it burn., Transfer to a nice board, drizzle over the rest of the sauce and carve at the table, to eat with your lovely salad."

Pour over the armagnac, cover and refrigerate overnight., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Melt the butter, then use a little to brush a loose-based 25cm round flan tin., Brush a sheet of pastry with the butter and lay it over the bottom of the tin, draping the excess over the sides., Sprinkle over ½ teaspoon of sugar. Brush a second pastry sheet with butter and lay it at right angles to the first, then sprinkle with sugar., Repeat the process with more pastry sheets, laying each sheet diagonally, until you have 4 pastry sheets left., Drain the apple slices, but not too thoroughly as the armagnac flavour is so good, then mix them in a bowl with the remaining sugar and the vanilla. Grate in the lemon zest, then pick and finely chop a few rosemary leaves and stir into the mixture., Pile the apple slices into the flan tin and spread them out evenly., Brush the remaining pastry sheets with butter and sprinkle with sugar, as before, then drape over the apples, butter-side down, with each sheet at right angles to the one before it., Draw the overhanging ends lightly over the top of the pie and arrange them so they stick up as much as possible, like crumpled tissue paper. They should completely cover the top of the pie, forming a light and airy crust. Brush lightly with butter., Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden, then very loosely cover with a sheet of tin foil. Cook for a further 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling., Allow it to cool slightly in the tin before transferring to a serving plate. If you feel nervous about doing this, serve it from the flan tin."

Season well and reduce the heat to low., Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the shallots have caramelised and the mixture has thickened. Remove from the heat and let it cool., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/gas 6., Trim and halve the parsnips, then peel and halve the shallots. Core and finely chop the apple., Heat the goose fat and butter in a 22cm-wide ovenproof frying pan over a medium-low heat. Add the parsnips and shallots, cut-side down, and cook for 10 minutes, until they begin to caramelise., Add the chestnuts and thyme sprigs, season well and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and top with about half of the shallot compote., Roll out the pastry and trim it so it’s slightly bigger than your pan. Remove the pan from the heat and roll the pastry over the top, tucking it in the edges. Bake for about 30 minutes, until the pastry is golden and crisp on top., Meanwhile, simmer the apple with 100ml of water in a small pan over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until softened. Season and stir in the balsamic., Serve the tarte tatin hot with the apple balsamic sauce on the side."

Drain in a colander, and allow to steam dry for a few minutes., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/gas 5. While the squash is cooking, ask the kids to untwist the sausage links, then shape into 2 coils. Get them to pick and poke sage leaves into the sausage coils at intervals. Stick wooden skewers through the coils to keep them intact., When it’s cooled a little, the children can mash the squash with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, the butter, cumin and a good grating of nutmeg, then season with sea salt and black pepper, to taste., Cut the apples into wedges, then pop the sausages and apples on a baking tray with any extra sage leaves – and the seeds from the squash, if you like. Drizzle with olive oil, then bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the sausages are golden and crispy, and the apples golden and soft. Cut the sausages into wedges and serve with the roasted apples, the squash mash, gravy or chutney, and some steamed green beans or broccolini."

chopping board, carefully halve the rolls across the middle using a bread knife, to give you a top and a base for each. Put to one side., Using an eating knife, cut each radish in half lengthways, then slice each radish half into 3 pieces and place into a large bowl., Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, scoop out the watery seeds with a teaspoon and discard. Slice each cucumber half into 4 pieces, then add to the bowl., Trim the carrot, then cut into 8 even-sized pieces and add to the bowl., Click apart the cauliflower florets and place into the bowl with the stalks., Pull out the pepper’s stalk, tearing out the core, then discard. Scoop out the seeds and white pith with a teaspoon, then discard. Cut the pepper into 4 slices, then cut each slice into 4 pieces. Add the pieces to the bowl., Remove the core from the apple half and place, flat-side down, on the board. Cut it into 6 even-sized pieces, then add to the bowl., Place a clean tea towel onto the chopping board and place the vegetables and chopped apple in a pile in the middle., Fold over each corner of the tea towel so your ingredients are wrapped up like a parcel – make sure there are no gaps to stop the vegetables from escaping., Carefully crush and squash the vegetables with a rolling pin until broken down into little pieces. Open up the parcel – if your pieces are still too big, wrap it back up and crush and squash again., Measure the balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil into the empty bowl to make your dressing., Pick the herb leaves, discarding the stalks. Tear the leaves into small pieces, adding them to the bowl as you go., Using scissors, snip the cress or sprouting herbs into the bowl, then add the peas and sunflower seeds., Add the squashed vegetables to the bowl, then using the tips of your fingers, carefully toss them in the dressing so they’re nicely coated., Spread the base of each roll with the cottage or cream cheese, then spread the soft side of each top with the houmous., Divide the vegetable mixture equally between the base of each roll. Place the lids on top, houmous-side down, press lightly, then tuck in!, Jamie's top tip: When beetroot is in season, I like to add it here for extra colour and flavour. Feel free to swap in your own favourite seasonal veg – just make sure it has a bit of crunch!"

Add the dried fruit (finely chop it first if using larger fruit), porridge oats, flaxseeds and milk, then mix well., Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in the fridge overnight to soak and swell., In the morning, or when you are ready to assemble the pots, give the soaked muesli a good stir, and divide between your pots. Peel the banana and slice it at an angle., Top each pot with some sliced banana, then add a spoon of yoghurt on top (this will stop the banana turning brown in transit). Roughly chop and sprinkle over the nuts, along with the berries., Drizzle with a little honey (if using), then pop the lid on – don’t forget to take some spoons!"

Fold two-thirds of the apple into the mixture, but avoid stirring too much at this stage., Place a high-sided griddle pan (roughly 25cm x 30cm) over a high heat and brush with the remaining melted butter. Pour in the batter, tilting the pan so the batter spreads out evenly. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for around 6 minutes, or until lightly golden underneath., Carefully flip it over (this can be tricky, but be bold and go for it!), then continue cooking for around 6 minutes, or until golden, crisp and cooked through., Slice into 6 pieces, then serve with natural yoghurt, the remaining grated apple, a drizzle of maple syrup and a dusting of cinnamon. They’re also delicious with fried bacon, eggs and maple syrup – give it a go when you’re feeling extra indulgent."

seeds, paprika and 1 teaspoon each of sea salt and black pepper in a pestle and mortar., Carefully cut the squash in half lengthways, deseed, then chop into 4cm chunks. Toss with half the spice mixture and a drizzle of olive oil on a baking tray., Roast for 50 minutes, or until golden, then remove from the oven and reduce the temperature to 150°C/300°F/gas 2., Meanwhile, drizzle both cuts of meat with olive oil and rub with the remaining spice mixture, then place a large casserole pan (at least 30cm wide, 8cm deep) on a medium-high heat., Put the pork and brisket into the pan fat side down and brown on all sides for around 15 minutes in total. Remove both meats to a plate and reduce the heat under the pan to medium., Peel and roughly chop the onions and add to the fat in the pan. Fry for 10 minutes, or until lightly caramelized, stirring regularly., Add the balsamic and the porcini liquor (discarding just the last gritty bit). Roughly chop and add the porcini, followed by the beans (juice and all), then scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands., Return both meats to the pan, loosen with a splash of water if needed, then bring to the boil. Season, and sit a layer of wet greaseproof paper directly on the surface. Cover with tin foil and cook in the oven for 5 hours, or until the meat is tender., Prick the peppers and chillies, then blacken all over in a griddle pan or directly over the flame of a gas hob. Place in a bowl, cover and leave to cool, then peel and deseed them, keeping as much juice as you can for extra flavour. Roughly chop with half the coriander, and toss with a little salt and pepper., When the meat is tender, remove from the oven, break up the meat, then stir in the squash, peppers and chillies. Adjust the consistency with water, if needed, taste and season to perfection, and keep warm., To finish, make the salsa. Peel the onion, then finely chop with the apples and the remaining coriander. Dress with the cider vinegar and extra virgin olive oil and season to perfection., Serve the chilli with the salsa. Also good with bread or rice, and yoghurt."

cheese","Place the pork loin on a board, skin side down, and rub all over with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., To make the stuffing, peel and finely slice the onions, then pick and chop the sage leaves. Place a large pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and the butter, then add the onions, sage, pine nuts, fennel seeds and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until soft and lightly golden, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, place the raisins and Vin Santo in a bowl and set aside to soak. Slice the sourdough and toast until golden, then halve the garlic clove and rub the cut side all over the toast. Pick the rosemary leaves and finely chop with the toast., Roughly chop the livers and stir into the pan. Turn the heat up to medium-high, stir in the soaked raisins, Vin Santo and toast, then finely grate in the lemon zest. Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7., Once cool, use clean hands to scrunch the mixture together, then scatter over the pork. Hold the oysters curved side down on a chopping board, look for the hinge between the top and bottom shell, then poke an oyster knife into the crack and prise it open (it’s not always easy, so you’ll need to use force here – but please be careful!). Press the oysters into the filling, and drizzle over any juices., Finely grate over the Parmesan, then, starting with one of the shortest edges, roll up the pork, patting on and compacting the stuffing as you go. Tie six pieces of string along the rolled meat to secure it, with the seam underneath, then season well and drizzle with oil, rubbing it all over the skin – this will help you get delicious crackling., Put the pork into a large roasting tray and place in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and crackled., Meanwhile, halve the apples and carrots, then peel and quarter the onions. Remove the pork from the oven and carefully place the apples and veg underneath the pork in the tray, then return to the oven and reduce the temperature to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Cook for a further 4 to 5 hours, or until the meat is really tender, basting now and again., Remove the porchetta to a clean tray and leave to rest while you make the gravy. Place the roasting tray on a medium heat on the hob. Skim away most of the fat from the surface into a jar, cool, and place in the fridge for another day., Stir in the flour, scraping up all those gnarly bits from the bottom of the tray. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil for 5 minutes, or until thickened, stirring occasionally., Strain through a sieve, pushing through all the goodness with the back of a spoon. Remove the string from the porchetta and carve. Serve with the homemade gravy and all the trimmings."

Add all the spices and juices and turn the heat up. Once boiling, turn down to a simmer and leave to tick away for 5–8 minutes., As everything infuses you’ll get delicious layers of flavour. Taste it and add sugar as you like. You don’t want it sweet; you just want the sugar to join the spices in a harmonious taste. When you’re happy with the flavours, ladle into glasses or mugs and serve warm."

I’m told Rhys makes a mean toad-in-the-hole, and I hope they enjoy this version for years to come. In Yorkshire, I learned how real Yorkshire folk approach making a great Yorkie. They aren’t into making their batter the night before, instead they focus on getting plenty of air into the batter and achieving a hot consistent temperature in the oven. I truly love this great classic and have only ever had one issue with it: quite often, you end up with half a sausage (the toad) poking out of the Yorkshire (the hole). The bit sticking out is crispy and golden – good times – but the other half of the sausage, inside the batter, is soft, anaemic and boiled – bad times. So in the spirit of family-style sharing and creating a dish that makes everyone go ‘Oooh!’ I’m separating out the elements so you end up with amazing crispy sausages, a tray of giant Yorkshire to tear up and a wonderful onion and apple gravy. Heaven., Whisk the eggs, flour, milk and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then pour into a jug. Preheat the oven to full whack (about 240°C/475°F/gas 9). Cut your onions into 1cm thick slices, and do the same with the apples – removing the core. Put a large pan on a medium heat. Add the butter, a lug of olive oil, the onions and the apples. Pick in the leaves from 2 sprigs of rosemary. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden. Remove the sauce from the heat once soft, season, and add the honey and a splash of water, if needed. Put the sausages into a sturdy roasting tray (roughly 30 x 40cm), toss with a little olive oil and cook in the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden., Transfer the cooked sausages to a pretty ovenproof dish and toss with half the apple and onion sauce. Cover with tin foil. Remove any excess fat from the roasting tray, replace with a good lug of olive oil and place on a medium heat. Add the remaining rosemary leaves and after 30 seconds, pour in the batter, then put straight into the middle of the oven with the sausages on the shelf underneath. Cook for around 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pudding is fluffy, golden and puffing up at the sides. Whatever you do, do not open the oven door., Put the pan of apples and onions back on a high heat and stir in the flour. Be brave; let it get really golden before adding the cider, stock and a couple of really good splashes of Worcestershire sauce. Let it boil and bubble away until thickened to your liking. Get your guests to the table, with their knives and forks in their hands. Put the bubbling gravy on a board in the middle of the table., Remove and uncover your sizzling sausages, then slide your Yorkshire pudding on to a nice board. This lovely dish definitely needs balancing, so serve with something green and fresh, like runner beans, greens, salad or dressed chard."

Leave on a gentle simmer for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally to stop it catching, until the sugar has completely dissolved and the mixture starts to darken., Gently stir in your pecans until they’re well coated in the caramel syrup. Be careful not to splash yourself, and don’t be tempted to have a taste because hot caramel can burn quite badly., Once coated, tip the nuts on to the oiled tray and use the back of a spoon to separate them out into one layer. Leave them to cool so the caramel can harden on the nuts., Meanwhile, make your dressing. Grate the orange zest into a large salad bowl, squeeze in the juice and add the Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar and a good lug of extra virgin olive oil. Whisk them, then have a taste – you want to get a nice balance between the sharpness of the vinegar and the smoothness of the oil, so add a little more oil if needed, then season carefully with sea salt and black pepper., Click off the chicory leaves and wash and spin dry all your leaves. Core, quarter and finely slice your apples and add to the bowl with all your leaves., Break the cooled pecans apart, add half of them to the bowl, and use your hands to delicately toss and dress everything., Serve on one big platter, or divide up between plates, and finish by crumbling over the rest of your beautiful caramel pecans."
