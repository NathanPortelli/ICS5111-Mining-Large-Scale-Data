Magic baked chicken fried rice | Jamie Oliver Cookbook Club recipes,Just put it all in a pan – even the uncooked rice – and bake!,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/152742682.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['a', 'main']",MINUTES COOK),"“Sometimes after a long day, even I don’t have the energy to deal with the hassle of chopping vegetables, pulling out woks and smoking out my kitchen – let alone remembering to cook rice the day before! So I published a ‘dump and bake’ fried rice on my website – albeit with some trepidation – convinced it would be slammed as an abomination. To my total surprise, the recipe was a smash hit and had 100,000 views in 24 hours! Truth is, it’s delicious – the flavour is fantastic, the rice is fluffy and moist. The most asked question I get is, ‘How can I add chicken to this?’ Well, here’s how! ”",,,,,,,,,"BAKED FRIED RICE, 1½

Tomato rice | Jamie Oliver recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/135559551.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['to', '6']",,"“This makes a great lunch with some fried chorizo on the side, or a side dish with roast chicken or lamb. Most of the time I make it, eat a portion and then use the deliberate leftovers to make the rice cake(s) (on page 54 of Home Food), which are the real bomb. I use brown rice at home as it is more nutritious and flavoursome, but in this recipe method I include a method for using white rice, too. If you decide to use brown rice, I recommend soaking it in advance: it takes two minutes to pour some water over the rice, but then it cooks much more quickly. ”",,,,,,,,,"360                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                brown or white rice, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                sunflower or olive oil, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onion                                                                                                                                                                , finely chopped, 400                                                                                                                                                                g can of                                                                                                                                                                chopped tomatoes, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                paprika                                                                                                                                                                , optional, sea salt","If you are using brown rice and feel organised/are planning this meal in advance, pour 500ml water over it and keep it in the fridge for 4 hours or – even better – overnight. This cuts the cooking time dramatically. If this is a spur-of-the-moment thing, don’t worry, you can still use white rice or unsoaked brown rice., Heat the oil and butter in a pan that you have a lid for (I use a 20cm cast-iron pan). Add the onion and cook over a medium-low heat, stirring from time to time, until it softens and starts becoming golden. About 10 minutes of cooking should get you to where you want to be, no need to caramelise too avidly here., Empty the canned tomatoes into a bowl and weigh them. If you are using white rice, add enough water to the bowl to make its total weight 700g. If you are using brown rice (soaked or unsoaked), add a little more, enough to make it up to 850g. Whisk in the paprika, if using, and a scant 2 teaspoons of salt. Taste the liquid and add a bit more salt if needed., Now, if you used brown rice and soaked it, drain it. Add whatever rice you are using to the buttery onion, toss to coat and then add the tomato mixture. Cover with a lid and bring to a simmer. From the moment the liquid starts simmering (the lid is always on), either soaked brown or unsoaked white rice will be ready in 20–25 minutes, while unsoaked brown rice will take closer to 40–45 minutes. When it’s ready, the liquid will be absorbed and the rice will be soft to the tooth., Another thing that you may discover, especially if you keep your heat a little higher, is that the rice might develop an amazing crispy layer at the bottom, not unlike an Iranian tahdig or Spanish socarrat.

Singapore-Style Chilli Tofu | Jamie Oliver recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/134979959.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",In50 minutes,"“This recipe was inspired by the stunning dish Singapore-style chilli prawns, which is itself a version of the famous Singapore chilli crab. Tofu can sometimes get a bad rap, but it makes a fantastic alternative to prawns, especially midweek. It has a relatively long shelf-life, so is great to have on hand in the fridge. Frying it until crispy gives it great texture, and it absorbs all the flavours of the sauce – and this dish is ALL about the sauce. It even converted my tofu-fearing husband. ”",,,,,,,,,"40

You’ve got a crunchy, golden outside that contrasts beautifully with the delicate, fluffy rice and tender cauliflower florets inside. I’ve also added a curveball ingredient inspired by a trip to Delhi, where I saw street-food vendors doing the most incredible things with poppadoms. This is food that just makes me happy.   ”",279,13.1g,2.2g,7.5g,4.5g,7.9g,33.3g,1g,"2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onions, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                head of                                                                                                                                                                cauliflower                                                                                                                                                                , (800g), 3                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                tikka curry paste, 1                                                                                                                                                                mug of                                                                                                                                                                basmati rice                                                                                                                                                                , (300g), 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    fresh mixed-colour chillies, 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                    uncooked poppadoms, 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                coriander                                                                                                                                                                , (30g), 6                                                                                                                                                                 tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                natural yoghurt, extra virgin olive oil",

Classically there’d be some sort of smoky ribs or ham in the mix, but you can use the principle of this recipe to suit what you’ve got in the fridge and, of course, you can go veggie if you want to. It’s brilliant for embracing odds and ends from your veg drawer, and hopefully will help you to eat the rainbow. As with most stir-fries, this one is all in the prep, setting you up for fast and efficient cooking. You can absolutely make more portions, but it’s best to cook them no more than 2 portions at a time. ”",528,18.4g,3.8g,8.5g,1.5g,22.2g,72.3g,6.6g,"150                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                brown or basmati rice, 320                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                crunchy veg                                                                                                                                                                , such as asparagus, baby corn, broccoli, leek, Chinese, red or white cabbage, pak choi, carrot, 1                                                                                                                                                                clove of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 2                                                                                                                                                                cm                                                                                                                                                                piece of ginger, 1                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range egg, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    chipolata, 1                                                                                                                                                                rasher of                                                                                                                                                                smoked streaky bacon, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    fresh or frozen raw peeled prawns, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                tikka paste, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                low-salt soy sauce, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                mixed seeds, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                chilli jam","Cook the rice according to the packet instructions, then drain and leave to cool. If you spread it across a plate, it will cool more quickly., Now prep the veg – chop everything into strips or chunks that are about the same size so it will be a pleasure to eat. Chop asparagus spears into 2cm lengths, halve or quarter baby corn, matchstick the carrot, and shred up cabbage – you get the idea., Peel and finely slice the garlic. Peel and finely chop or grate the ginger., Put a large non-stick frying pan or wok on a medium-high heat., Beat the egg. Put 1 teaspoon of olive oil into the hot pan, then pour in the egg, swirling it around the pan to cover the base, essentially like a thin egg pancake. Let it cook through, then ease out of the pan with a spatula, roll it up and finely slice., Put ½ a tablespoon of olive oil into the hot pan. Finely slice the sausage and bacon, then add to the pan. Stir-fry until golden, then go in with the prawns, garlic and ginger., Stir in the curry paste until everything is coated, then start adding your veg, getting stuff that needs a bit longer in there first like carrots and leek. Keep stirring or tossing and adding the veg until it’s all in there., Mix in the cool rice and stir-fry until it’s hot through and the veg are just cooked., Add the soy, then toss in the egg ribbons., Divide between your plates, sprinkle over the seeds, season to perfection with more soy if you like, and finish with a drizzle of chilli jam. Eat right away – heaven!"

Peel the onion, trim the celery, then finely chop or coarsely grate them., Put 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 knob of butter, plus the onion and celery into a high-sided pan on a low heat. Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the veg is soft but not coloured., Turn up the heat to medium, add the rice and stir for 2 minutes, so it sucks up all the lovely flavour. If using, pour in the wine and stir until absorbed., Add a ladleful of hot stock, stir, and wait until it’s been fully absorbed before adding more. Cook for 16 to 18 minutes, adding more stock every minute or so and stirring regularly, until the rice is al dente. This means it should be soft and a pleasure to eat, but still holding its shape., About 5 minutes before your rice is ready, stir in the frozen veg to cook through., Now, your risotto needs to be slightly looser than you want it to be, as it will thicken as it sits, so add an extra ladleful of stock. Turn off the heat, stir or beat in the remaining butter and the Parmesan, then season to perfection., Pop the lid on and let it sit for 2 minutes before serving. The most important thing is that the risotto is always oozy., Finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, an extra grating of cheese and, if you’ve got it, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice per portion."

Finely slice the tomatoes into rounds., Randomly bomb the pesto over the rice, then start layering up your veg: cover the rice with rounds of onion, then move on to a layer of courgettes, overlapping them as you go, followed by a layer of tomatoes. Repeat, moving slightly nearer the middle each time until you’ve covered the whole surface (use the picture to help you out – it might look a bit fiddly, but it’s child’s play to make)., Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper, then place under the grill on the middle shelf for 25 minutes, or until beautifully gratinated., Meanwhile, for the tapenade, destone and very finely chop the olives, then mix with ½ a tablespoon each of vinegar and extra virgin olive oil., To serve, pick over the basil leaves, dot over the olive tapenade and delicately tear over the mozzarella."

the cinnamon, black pepper, curry leaves and a good pinch of salt. Give it a good bash until everything has broken down., Add 3 tablespoons of boiling water and muddle to make a smooth paste., Cut the tuna into 6 even chunks, rub all over with the paste, then leave to marinate for 20 minutes., Meanwhile, for the rice, peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then place in a shallow pan on a medium heat with the butter. Roughly chop the pandan and add to the pan. Tear in the curry leaves, then give everything a good stir and cook for 8 minutes or until softened, but not coloured., Stir in the turmeric, add the rice and cook for a few minutes more., Pour in 2 mugfuls (300ml) of boiling water, season with a good pinch of sea salt, then pop the lid and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed. Turn off the heat and leave it to steam for a further 10 minutes., Line a lidded clay pot or a small cast iron pan with a piece of banana leaf. Pop the fish in the bottom in a single layer, then cover with another piece of banana leaf, and the lid. Place the pan on the hob over a low heat and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until just cooked through., To make the sambal, deseed and finely chop the tomatoes, and trim and finely slice the chilli (deseed if you like). Scrape out the coconut with a fork (about 100g) and combine in a bowl with the tomato and chilli. Finely zest over the limes, then squeeze in the juice and season to taste., Line 2 plates with banana leaves and arrange a little bit of everything on each. Garnish with extra shaved coconut and chilli flakes, if you like."

        , (optional)","To poach the chicken, cut the onion into quarters (leaving the skin on), scrub and halve the carrots, trim and roughly chop the celery, halve the bulb of garlic. Place it all into a large, deep pot with the chicken, peppercorns and parsley. Cover with cold water, then add 1 teaspoon of sea salt and place on a high heat. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 1½ hours, or until the chicken is cooked through and falling away from the bone, skimming away and discarding any scum that rises to the surface. Turn off the heat and leave the chicken to soak in the pot until ready to serve., For the mole, halve and deseed the dried peppers, then lightly toast in a dry frying pan for a couple of minutes (being careful not to char them) – you may need to do this in batches. Tip into a large heatproof bowl, cover with boiling water and leave to soften (about 20 minutes)., Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of pork dripping in a large, deep frying pan on a medium heat. Add the sesame seeds, peanuts and almonds, and toast for 5 minutes, or until golden. Remove to a bowl., Add another tablespoon of dripping to the pan. Peel and roughly chop the onions and garlic, then fry with the ground spices for 5 to 10 minutes, or until softened., Peel the plantain and roughly chop with the tomatoes. Add to the pan, along with the raisins and toasted nuts and seeds (reserving 3 tablespoons for serving)., Roughly tear in the corn tortilla and bread roll, then drain the peppers and mix everything together in a large bowl ready for blitzing., Working in batches, transfer the mixture to a liquidiser and whiz until smooth, adding a little water to each batch until you reach the desired consistency. Pass the mixture through a coarse sieve into a large pan on a low heat, with 4 tablespoons of dripping., Coarsely grate in the dark chocolate, stir it through the mole, then  leave to simmer for 1 hour, or until the flavours have mellowed and the sauce is rich and thick, stirring regularly. Have a taste and season to perfection, adding a little poaching liquor from the chicken to loosen., For the corn salsa, preheat a griddle pan on a medium-high heat. Add the corn and toast for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the kernels are scorched and blackened, turning regularly for even cooking. Alternatively, char the corn directly on a gas hob. Carefully slice the kernels from the cob with a sharp knife., Finely zest 1 lime over a serving bowl, then squeeze in the juice of both limes and add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Peel the red onion and finely dice with the tomatoes, slice the jalapeños (deseed, if you like), then add to the bowl, along with the corn. Toss well and leave to one side., For the green rice, dollop the dripping into a pan on a medium heat. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, add to the pan and cook for a couple of minutes. Stir in the rice and cook for a few minutes more, or until the onions are golden and slightly softened., Add 500ml of the chicken poaching liquor or stock, then finely chop the herbs and add to the pan, along with the epazote (if using). Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked., Pull the chicken from the carcass and shred the meat. Bash the reserved seeds and nuts in a pestle and mortar to a chunky crumb., Ladle about 500ml of mole into a clean pan and keep warm while you assemble the enchiladas., Working two to three at a time, brush the outside of the tortillas with a little pork dripping, then flip them over and top each with a good handful of chicken. Fold them in half, pressing the edges to seal., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat and fry the tortillas for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp., Dunk the tortillas into the warm mole, then place on a serving plate. Sprinkle over the bashed nuts, then add a dollop of salsa and a few sprigs of coriander. Serve with the green rice. Delicious!"

Parmesan cheese, extra virgin olive oil","Preheat the oven to 160°C/325°F/gas 3., Blanch the tomatoes in a large pan of boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice-cold water and peel the skins. Tip into a medium roasting tray., Peel and slice the garlic, pick the rosemary leaves and scatter over the tomatoes. Drizzle over a little oil, then toss to coat and space them out in a single layer. Roast for 40 minutes, or until golden., Remove the heads and tails from the langoustines, then peel the skin and roughly chop the sweet meat. Check the mussels and sort through the clams, giving any that aren’t tightly closed a tap. If they don’t close, discard them. Finely slice the squid and reserve for later.  Pick through the crab meat, removing any shell., Put the saffron in a small bowl, cover with 50ml of freshly boiled water and leave to infuse., For the risotto, peel and finely chop the onion, celery and fennel, reserving any nice leaves and herby tops for garnish, then place in a large, high-sided pan on a medium heat with 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Cook for 15 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally, then stir in the rice to toast for 2 minutes., Pour in the wine, and stir until absorbed. Add a ladleful of stock and wait until it’s been fully absorbed before adding another, stirring for around 10 seconds every minute and continuing to add ladlefuls of stock until the rice is soft and a pleasure to eat, but retains its shape and a tiny bit of bite. It will need 16 to 18 minutes,, Add the saffron and its soaking liquid, then stir in the mussels and clams., When the mussels are just starting to open up, go in with the squid, crab and langoustine. 
Beat in the butter, finely grate and and beat in the Parmesan, then season to perfection and turn the heat off. Cover the pan and leave to relax for 1 to 2 minutes so the risotto becomes creamy and oozy. Beat again, adding a little extra stock if necessary., Carefully pour the risotto onto a large platter and discard any mussels or clams that remain closed. Dot over the roasted tomatoes, scatter over the reserved celery leaves and herby fennel tops, then drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil. Dish up and enjoy!"

You know it’s ready when it’s thick enough for your spoon to stand up in the middle – how cool is that. ”",545,11.3g,3.9g,9.4g,1.4g,22.4g,82.6g,8.5g,"50                                                                                                                                                                g piece of                                                                                                                                                                higher-welfare smoked pancetta, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                higher-welfare salami, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onions, 2                                                                                                                                                                sticks of                                                                                                                                                                celery, 1                                                                                                                                                                litre                                                                                                                                                                organic meat stock, 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                 fresh rosemary (30g), 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Arborio risotto rice, 250                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                Barbera d’Asti red wine, 1                                                                                                                                                                 x 400g tin of                                                                                                                                                                quality plum tomatoes, 1                                                                                                                                                                 x 400g tin of                                                                                                                                                                borlotti beans, 4                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh flat-leaf parsley","Chop the pancetta and salami into 1cm chunks, place in a cold casserole pan and put it on a medium-high heat to let the fat render out. Stir occasionally while you peel the onions and celery, then chop both into 1cm chunks. Stir the veg into the pan and cook for 10 minutes, or until soft, stirring regularly. In a separate pan, simmer the stock and rosemary., Stir the rice into the veg to toast for 2 minutes, then pour in the wine and let it cook away. Scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands, then start adding the stock, a ladleful at a time, letting each one cook away before adding more. Keep a close eye on it and stir constantly for 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked but still retains its shape. Drain the beans and stir into the pan with the last ladleful of stock. When your spoon stands up, it’s done. Taste, and season to perfection with black pepper. Finely chop and stir in the parsley leaves, then tuck on in."

Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, then stir in the rice to toast., After 2 minutes, pour in the wine and stir until absorbed., Now start adding the stock, a ladleful at a time, letting each one cook away before adding more, and stirring constantly for 16 to 18 minutes, or until the rice is cooked but still retains its shape., When done, add a splash of stock or water to make it oozy, then finely grate over most of the Parmesan, beat it in with the remaining butter, taste, and season to perfection., Turn the heat off, then bomb in little nuggets of fontina, so they melt subtly into the rice., Cover, and leave to rest off the heat for 2 minutes while you crush the nuts., Divide the risotto between warm plates, then finely grate over the remaining Parmesan., Sprinkle over the crushed nuts and thyme tips, then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil."

Repeat this, stirring and massaging the starch out for the rice for 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked but still holding its shape and the risotto is oozy., Meanwhile, toast 30g of blanched hazelnuts in a frying pan over a medium heat until golden, then roughly bash in a pestle and mortar., Squeeze the juice from 1 lemon into a small bowl, then mix in 4 tablespoons of natural yoghurt, 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Divide 100g of baby spinach between 4 plates, dot over the dressing, then sprinkle over the hazelnuts., Turn off the heat under the risotto, finely grate in 35g of Parmesan and strip in the remaining thyme leaves (15g), then beat in 20g of unsalted butter and season to taste with salt and pepper., Cover and leave to relax for 2 minutes so it becomes creamy and oozy. Beat again, then serve right away with the salad, finishing it with a fine grating of Parmesan (5g)."

Bash to a paste, then muddle in 2 heaped tablespoons of natural yoghurt., Sprinkle the coriander leaves over the curry, squeeze the juice of ½ a lemon into the rice, then serve with the poppadoms, coriander yoghurt and lemon pickle.

finely chop the celery, then peel and finely slice the shallots and garlic., Place a large, deep frying pan over a medium heat, with 2 tablespoons of oil and 20g of the butter. Stir in the celery, shallot and garlic and fry for 10 to 15 minutes, or until softened and translucent., Turn the heat up and stir in the rice. After 1 to 2 minutes, pour in the wine and allow it to bubble away., Have your stock hot, ready to go. Once the wine has been absorbed, reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in a ladleful of stock; keep the rice moving to help it release the starch, which gives risotto its signature creaminess., Keep adding stock, a ladleful at a time, until the rice is al dente., Finely grate in half the lemon zest, stir through the brown crabmeat, then add the remaining butter. Finely grate in the Parmesan, season, beat everything together, then leave it off the heat with the lid on for a couple of minutes., Meanwhile, remove the woody ends from your asparagus and halve the spears lengthways. Toss with a drizzle of oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of sea salt., Stir the white crabmeat through the risotto. Pick and finely chop the parsley leaves and stir through, along with a squeeze of lemon juice., Divide between bowls and top with the asparagus, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, an extra grating of parmesan and freshly ground black pepper."

remove the excess moisture. Mix with 2 tablespoons of the rice vinegar and 1 tablespoon of the mirin., Finely chop the coriander stalks, reserving the leaves. Measure 2 tablespoons of your chosen citrus fruit juice (save the rest for another day) and mix with the stalks, tamari or soy sauce, sesame oil and 2 tablespoons of mirin, then set aside., Cook the rice according to the packet instructions and pop in a bowl with the coconut cream and the remaining 2 tablespoons of mirin. Mix well, season and cover with tin foil to keep warm., Toast the nori in a dry frying pan over a medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes on each side until crisp. Leave to cool before cutting into small pieces with a pair of scissors., Drain the tuna, peel, destone and dice the avocado, and trim and finely slice the spring onions., Divide the warm rice between bowls, top with tuna, avocado and the pickled cucumber. Scatter with the nori, sesame seeds and spring onion, tear over the coriander leaves, then drizzle over the dressing to finish."

Place the heads and shells in a pan with the saffron, pour over the stock, then simmer over a low heat to infuse., Dice the chicken and pork into 3cm chunks, then toss with the paprika and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Place a large ovenproof frying or paella pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the meat and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden, stirring occasionally, while you peel and finely chop the onion, garlic and celery., Remove the meat to a plate and stir the chopped veg into the fat in the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened, then return the meat to the mix., At the same time, quickly drop the crayfish into the stock to cook for 4 minutes, remove with a slotted spoon, halve lengthways and place in a large bowl., Cut a cross into the bottom of each tomato, plunge them into the stock for 40 seconds, then carefully peel, deseed and roughly chop., Stir the paella rice into the meat pan to toast for a few minutes, then ladle in 1 litre of stock through a sieve. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced and the rice is nearly cooked, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley. Run the tip of a knife down the back of each prawn and pull out the vein, meaning they’ll butterfly as they cook., Slice the tentacles from the squid, keeping them whole, then open out the tubes and lightly score in a criss-cross fashion with a regular eating knife., Place the prawns, squid and mussels in the crayfish bowl with the drained artichokes, most of the parsley and the mangetout (roughly slice, if you like), then dress with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, the juice of 1 lemon and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Poke and scatter the contents of the bowl into the rice, then place uncovered in the oven for 10 minutes, or until beautifully cooked. Scatter over the remaining parsley leaves and serve with lots of lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Add the parsley stalks, shallot, garlic and chorizo to the heated oil and cook over a medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, or until the shallot is softened and the chorizo is beginning to crisp., In another pan, heat the stock with the tinned tomatoes. Add the rice to the shallot mixture and stir to coat the grains. Cook over a high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the grains have cracked and are slightly translucent at the tips, then pour in the red wine., Stir well and cook until almost all the wine has evaporated. Add the hot stock and tomato mixture, ladle by ladle, stirring well with each addition, and only adding more when the previous ladle is almost fully absorbed. You may not need all of the mixture, or you may need to top it up with a little water., The rice should be tender but with a little bite in the middle. When it’s cooked, add one last ladle of liquid., Finely grate the Parmesan, then add to the pan with some seasoning. Stir well, take off the heat and cover. Leave for 5 minutes or so before stirring again, tasting and adjusting the seasoning, if necessary., Serve topped with extra grated Parmesan and the chopped parsley leaves."

Bring to the boil, turn the heat down to low and simmer gently for 30 minutes, or until thickened and reduced., Halve and destone 1 avocado, squeeze the flesh out onto a board, then season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Add the juice from 1 lime, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, then chop and mix it all together and scrape into a bowl., Return the corn pan to a high heat. Drain 1 x 400g tin of black beans in a sieve, then rinse with cold water and drain well. Once hot, add the beans and ½ a teaspoon of smoked paprika, then fry for 5 minutes, or until crispy and gnarly., Divide everything between serving bowls, arranging in separate little piles., To finish, add a dollop of natural yoghurt, scatter with coriander leaves, add a shake of hot chilli sauce and serve with the tortillas (serve warm, if you like) and wedges of lime for squeezing over. Mix up all the flavours, then tuck in."

Cook the rice according to the packet instructions, then drain and rinse under cold water. Set aside while you work on your fish., Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Slash the mullet skin three to four times (don’t cut too far into the flesh). Pop a few sprigs of lemon thyme into each cavity and season well., Wrap the head of each fish in a slice of pancetta and drizzle with a little olive oil. Pop the fish on a large roasting tin and roast for 12 minutes, or until cooked through., Meanwhile, make your tapenade. Drain and soak the olives in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes. Drain well, then remove the stones., Peel the garlic, then bash in a pestle and mortar with the dried chilli flakes and fennel seeds until fine. Tip into a bowl., Roughly chop the almonds, olives and sundried tomato and add to the bowl, followed by the spice mix and extra virgin olive oil., Tip the rice into a large bowl. Halve and bash the pomegranate with a spoon so the seeds fall into the bowl., Pick, chop and add the mint and parsley leaves along with the lemon zest and a squeeze of juice. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Mix well., When the fish is cooked, remove it from the oven and leave to rest for 2 minutes., Arrange the rice on a platter, lay the fish on top and serve with the tapenade on the side."

Add the garlic and cook for a further minute., Turn up the heat, add the rice and stir for a couple of minutes until translucent, then add the wine and keep stirring until all of it has been absorbed., Pour in the hot stock in small amounts, stirring continuously over a low heat until the rice is almost cooked; you may not need all of the stock., Add the peas and cook for a couple of minutes more., Turn off the heat and stir in the butter, remaining spring onions and lemon zest. Finely grate in the Parmesan, pick, chop and add the herbs, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Leave to cool completely., Take small handfuls and shape into cakes. Beat the eggs in a shallow bowl, then place the breadcrumbs on a plate alongside it., Dip the cakes in the egg, shaking off any excess, then coat in the breadcrumbs., Heat enough oil to fill a large frying pan to about half the depth of the cakes. Fry the arancini for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until golden, then drain on kitchen paper., Serve with a green salad and a squeeze of lemon."
Oozy Courgette Risotto | Jamie Oliver,with buffalo mozzarella & fresh basil,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/46337890.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In40 minutes,"“This is the coming together of three beautiful ingredients – mozzarella, basil and courgette – to make an oozy, cheesy, scrumptious risotto. White wine gives any risotto a beautiful depth of flavour, but don’t worry if you haven’t got any, swap in the same amount of extra stock instead – it will still taste fantastic. This recipe includes two of your 5-a-day, so it’s comfort food that still delivers on the nutrition front – you’ve got to love it! ”",505,17.6g,10g,4.9g,0.7g,22g,64.1g,2.3g,"1                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                onion, 1                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                clove of garlic, 2                                                                                                                                                                sticks of                                                                                                                                                                celery, 1                                                                                                                                                                knob of                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter, olive oil, 2                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                courgettes (300g), 800                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                organic vegetable stock, 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil, 40                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Italian hard cheese, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                arborio rice, 200                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                white wine                                                                                                                                                                , optional, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    fresh red chilli, 2 x 125                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                balls of buffalo mozzarella","Peel the onion and garlic, trim the celery and finely chop all three. Place a large saucepan over a medium-low heat., Place the butter in the hot pan with the onion, garlic and celery, a splash of oil, and a splash of water. Reduce the heat to low and cook for around 5 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Trim the courgettes, slice lengthways into quarters, then chop into small ½cm chunks and put to one side., Fill a medium saucepan with 800ml water. Add the stock cube and bring to the boil over a high heat, stirring to dissolve, then turn the heat down to low., Pick and reserve the basil leaves, then add the stalks to the pan of stock. Finely grate the Italian hard cheese., Once the vegetables are very soft but not browned, add the rice to the pan., Stir and fry the rice for 1 minute until translucent, then add the wine (if using) and keep stirring until it has been absorbed by the rice., Turn the heat under the rice up to medium, then add a ladleful of hot stock, avoiding the basil stalks – these are there to add flavour but not to be eaten!, Stir constantly and continue adding stock, a ladle at a time, waiting for the rice to soak it all up before adding the next ladleful. Continue until you’ve used two-thirds of the stock., Finely chop the basil leaves and the chilli (deseed the chilli if you prefer a milder heat)., Stir the chopped courgette into the stock, and keep adding it (courgette and all) until the rice is cooked and the risotto has a nice oozy consistency – if you run out of stock, use boiling water., Take the pan of risotto off the heat. Tear the mozzarella balls into pieces and stir into the pan with half the basil., Stir through half the grated Italian hard cheese, then season to taste with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Cover with a lid and allow to sit for two minutes., Divide the risotto between four plates, scatter over the remaining cheese, basil and the fresh chilli, then tuck in!"

                        lemon, extra virgin olive oil","To make the fish stock, place the reserved cuttlefish skin and trimmings in a large pan. Pour in the chicken stock (if using) or 1 litre of boiling water and bring to the boil on a high heat., Simmer for 20 minutes, then strain through a fine sieve into another pan and leave over a very low heat to keep warm until needed., Slice the tentacles from the cuttlefish, then open out the tubes and lightly score the underside in a criss-cross pattern with a regular eating knife. Chop it all into 2cm pieces., Peel the onion and garlic and finely chop on a clean board with the parsley stalks (reserving the leaves). Deseed and dice the tomatoes. Place a medium pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the butter, then add the onion, garlic, parsley stalks and anchovies. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly., Add the cuttlefish, tomatoes, tomato purée, wine, cuttlefish ink and 500ml of stock. Cook for 15 minutes, or until the cuttlefish is tender. Meanwhile, cook the risotto rice in a pan of boiling salted water for 10 to 15 minutes, or until al dente, then drain., Finely chop the parsley leaves, finely slice the chilli (deseed if you like), then, in a bowl, mix with most of the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Gently fold the drained rice into the cuttlefish pan and add a good squeeze of lemon juice., Remove from the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes so the rice sucks up some of that flavoursome liquid. Serve drizzled with the chilli-spiked parsley oil. Super-tasty!"

drizzle of olive oil, add the onions and cook for 15 minutes, or until soft but not coloured., Turn the heat up to medium, pour in the risotto rice and stir for a few minutes, to ensure every grain is coated, then add the saffron and stir well., Pour in the wine and let it bubble away for a couple of minutes, stirring regularly. Start ladling in the stock bit by bit, stirring it through the rice and allowing each ladleful to become absorbed before adding the next. Continue until the rice is cooked through – about 15 to 20 minutes., Stir in the grated Parmesan and a squeeze of lemon juice, then leave to cool while you make the filling., Place the pistachios in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Set aside for 20 minutes, then drain and remove the skins; this gives your filling a better colour and smoother texture., Chop the pistachios, mozzarella, caciocavallo cheese, and the tomatoes, then combine with the oregano and lemon zest. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper., To form the arancini, scoop a portion of the cooled risotto into your hand. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling mixture into the centre and wrap the risotto around it to seal completely. Repeat with the remaining risotto and filling., For the pane, place the flour, beaten eggs and breadcrumbs into separate shallow bowls. Carefully dip each arancini ball into the flour, shaking off any excess, then the egg, and finally the crumbs, ensuring the rice is completely coated. Set aside., To make the arrabbiata sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, finely slice the chilli and pick the basil, finely chopping the stalks., Place the garlic, chilli and basil stalks in a pan over a medium heat with a splash of olive oil and fry for 2 minutes. Pour in the tomatoes, season and cook for 10 minutes over a medium-low heat. Transfer to a blender and blitz until smooth., Pour the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over a high heat. To test the oil is ready, drop in a few breadcrumbs – if they sizzle and float, it is ready., Carefully lower in the arancini with a slotted spoon, in batches of four, and deep-fry for 8 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain., Delicious served with fried capers, fresh oregano and basil leaves, grated Parmesan and the punchy arrabbiata sauce for dunking."

The biggest one was for about 800 people in a village in Spain and it was hard work, but an incredible experience. The Spanish can be quite protective about what is and what isn’t a paella, but at the same time, the spirit of their cooking has always been flexible to whatever meat, fish, seafood or game can be found. I’ve eaten and enjoyed many paellas, and I hope you like my humble, great-value expression of one. ”",494,12g,3.3g,8.5g,1.6g,26.5g,75.7g,5.7g,"2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onion, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    carrot, ½ a                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh flat-leaf parsley                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), 70                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                quality chorizo, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    free-range chicken thighs                                                                                                                                                                , skin off, bone out, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                sweet smoked paprika, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red pepper, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                tomato purée, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    organic chicken stock cube, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                paella rice, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                frozen peas, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                frozen peeled cooked prawns                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon","Peel and finely slice the garlic, peel and roughly chop the onion and carrot. Finely chop the parsley stalks, then roughly chop the chorizo and chicken thighs., Put a lug of oil into a large lidded shallow casserole or paella pan on a medium heat, add the garlic, onion, carrot, parsley stalks, chorizo, chicken and paprika, and fry for around 5 minutes, stirring regularly., Deseed and chop the pepper, then add to the pan for a further 5 minutes., Stir through the tomato purée and crumble in the stock cube, then add the rice and stir for a couple of minutes so it starts to suck up all that lovely flavour., Pour in 750ml of boiling water and add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Pop the lid on and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 15 minutes, stirring regularly from the outside in and from the inside out, and adding a splash of water if needed., Stir in the peas and prawns, replace the lid, and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until hot through., Season to perfection, then chop the parsley leaves, scatter them over the paella, and serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over."

Deseed and finely slice the chilli, then trim and finely slice the spring onions and peel and finely slice the garlic., Pick the coriander leaves and set aside for later, then finely slice the stalks. Put all the chopped veg and herb stalks into a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat with a couple of lugs of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Fry for around 5 minutes, or until soft, stirring regularly., Add the rice, lemon zest and juice and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until golden and warmed through., Meanwhile, toss the turkey in the barbecue sauce, then add to a medium frying pan over a medium-high heat and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until crispy and slightly caramelised., Warm the tortillas in a dry frying pan, then divide and pile equal amounts of the Cajun rice and turkey onto one side of each tortilla. Scatter over the reserved coriander leaves and crumble the feta on top., Roll them up, tucking in one side as you go, so you end up with four open-ended burritos. Serve with a dollop of yoghurt and a drizzle of chilli sauce on the side."

Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Trim and finely chop the celery., Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the knob of butter into a separate pan, add the onion, garlic and celery, and cook very slowly for about 15 minutes without colouring. This is called a soffrito. When the vegetables have softened, add the rice and turn up the heat., The rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep stirring it. After a minute it will look slightly translucent. Add the vermouth or wine and keep stirring – it will smell fantastic. Any harsh alcohol flavours will evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty essence., Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of sea salt. Turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn't cook too quickly on the outside. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the creamy starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take around 15 minutes., Taste the rice to check if it’s cooked. If not, carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. Don’t forget to check the seasoning carefully. If you run out of stock before the rice is cooked, add some boiling water., Remove from the heat and add the 70g butter and grate in the Parmesan. Stir well. Place a lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 minutes. This is the most important part of making the perfect risotto, as this is when it becomes amazingly creamy and oozy like it should be. Eat it as soon as possible, while it retains its beautiful texture."

                                                    lemon, extra virgin olive oil","Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan and keep warm. In a separate large pan, add a splash of olive oil, the onion and celery, and cook gently for about 15 minutes until softened., Add the rice and turn up the heat a bit. Keep stirring to stop it catching. After a minute or two, pour in the vermouth or wine and stir constantly until the alcohol has evaporated, leaving the rice with a lovely perfume., Turn down the heat and add a ladleful of warm stock. Keep stirring until the rice has fully absorbed the stock, then add another ladleful. Continue to add the stock, one ladleful at a time, until it’s all absorbed. This should take about 15 minutes and give you rice that is beginning to soften but is still al dente., Meanwhile, pop the goat’s cheese onto a roasting tray, sprinkle over the fennel seeds and red chilli, and place in the oven for 10 minutes., Next, heat a deep saucepan on a medium heat, then add 1 tablespoon of butter, a splash of olive oil, the garlic and a good grating of nutmeg., Once the butter has melted, add the sorrel and cook for about 2 minutes, moving it around until it’s just wilted down. Take the pan off the heat, let the sorrel cool slightly, then chop it finely and season to taste., Take the pan of rice off the heat, add the chopped sorrel and beat in the remaining butter and grated Parmesan. Add a good squeeze of lemon juice, then check the seasoning and add a little salt and pepper if needed., Pop a lid on the pan and leave the risotto to rest for a minute, while you remove the goat’s cheese from the oven., Dish up your risotto, grate a little lemon zest over the top, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, and top with another grating of Parmesan. Serve with the lovely roasted goat’s cheese on the side for everyone to crumble over the top."

The use of vodka instead of wine leaves you with a fragrant freshness when the risotto is cooked, which marries fantastically well with smoky flakes of haddock and the al dente crunch of fine yellow beans. As there is fish in this risotto you don’t want to include any Parmesan, so bear this in mind. If you’re a risotto fan you’ve got to give this a try.

Start your basic risotto, adding the vodka at Stage 2 instead of the wine. Then lightly poach your haddock in the milk and stock from the basic recipe with a couple of bay leaves, covered with a lid. Simmer for around 5 minutes and remove from the heat. At Stage 3 of the basic recipe, I like to add the poaching liquor to the rice and then I carry on as normal through the recipe. At the end of Stage 3 flake in your smoked haddock, add the beans and carry on as normal through to the end of the recipe. Don’t serve with any Parmesan sprinkled over – serve sprinkled with the celery leaves. Add a dash of vodka and a squeeze of lemon to lift the flavours. Lovely."

the stock in a pan over a moderate heat. Heat the olive oil in a pan. Add the onions, garlic and celery, and fry gently for about 5 minutes until softened. Add the rice to the pan and turn up the heat. Cook for a minute or so, stirring constantly, until the rice looks slightly translucent. Add the wine and keep stirring - any alcohol flavours will evaporate., Once the wine has been absorbed by the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn't cook too quickly on the outside. Add the stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next, until the rice is cooked but still holds its shape - this takes about 15 minutes., Stir in the Appenzeller and Taleggio. Remove the pan from the heat and season to taste, then beat in the butter and Parmesan. Place a lid on the pan and leave to rest for 2 to 3 minutes - your risotto will get nice and oozy. Enjoy!"

lot more easily after they have been cooked. Put them into a small pan with 4 tablespoons of the sugar, the cinnamon stick and the zest and juice of the orange. Put a lid on top and slowly simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, until the peach skin and stones can be easily removed. You don't want to cook them to pulp – they should be soft but should still hold their shape. Remove from the heat and put to one side., In an appropriately sized high-sided, thick-bottomed pan with a lid, slowly melt two-thirds of the butter. Score down the length of the vanilla pods and remove the seeds by scraping a knife down the inside of each half. Add the seeds to the butter and stir. Continue to cook for 1 minute before adding your rice with the remaining sugar. Turn the heat up to medium, stir the rice, and add the wine, continuing to stir until it has almost cooked away. Now add the milk little by little. Keep the rice on a slow but constant simmer for about 16 or 17 minutes and stir it as often as you can. In this way you can massage the starch out of the rice and this will give you a silky, oozy end product, much like the classic Italian risotto. When the rice has cooked through it should be soft yet still holding its shape. You may need to add a little more milk or water just to adjust the consistency. Remove from the heat, add the grated white chocolate and the rest of the butter, then stir, place a lid on top and leave for a few minutes., Remove the skin and stones from the peaches, discard them along with the cinnamon stick, and take the peaches to the table with your block of dark chocolate, snapped into small pieces. Spoon the risotto on to plates, then push a couple of pieces of dark chocolate into the middle of each one. Just so you know, a perfect risotto should slowly creep and ooze to the side of your plate, so don't worry if it starts to spread out! Gently tear the peaches and place some on each plate, then drizzle over some of the lovely juice and sprinkle over a few mint leaves. By the time you go to eat it, the dark chocolate will have melted. Joy joy joy!"

Tap For Method","Whiz the lemon zest, dried chillies, garlic, anchovies and bread chunks in a food processor with a bit of oil from the anchovy tin until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs., Heat a large frying pan and add a splash of olive oil. Fry the breadcrumbs in the oil until darkened and crisp, then drain them on a piece of kitchen paper and allow to cool., Make your basic risotto recipe"">basic risotto recipe., Place a large saucepan on a medium to high heat and pour in half the stock, followed by all your risotto base. Stirring all the time, gently bring to the boil, turn the heat down and simmer until almost all the stock has been absorbed., Add the rest of the stock a ladleful at a time until the rice is cooked. You might not need all your stock. Be careful not to overcook the rice – check it throughout cooking to make sure it’s a pleasure to eat. It should hold its shape but be soft, creamy and oozy. And the overall texture should be slightly looser than you think you want it., Turn off the heat, beat in your butter and Parmesan, check the seasoning and add a little sea salt and black pepper if needed. Don’t be too generous with the salt because the pangrattato has salt in it too and you don’t want to overdo it!, Place a lid on the pan and leave the risotto to rest for a minute. You can now take the pan to the table so that everyone can help themselves, or divide the risotto between individual serving plates and sprinkle the pangrattato over the top. Place a block of Parmesan on the table with a grater and tuck in., Matt's wine suggestion: Italian white – Verdicchio"

Carefully cut your butternut squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Put these to one side. Cut the squash lengthways into 0.5cm/¼ inch slices. Bash up your coriander and chillies with a pinch of salt and pepper in a pestle and mortar (or use a metal bowl and the end of a rolling pin). Dust this over your squash with a tablespoon of olive oil. Toss around until completely coated. Line up snugly in a roasting tray and bake for around 30 minutes until the flesh and skin are soft to the touch. Now get all your ingredients ready and start making your basic risotto., Remove the squash from the oven and lay your pancetta over it. Mix the squash seeds, chestnuts and sage leaves with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Sprinkle over the squash and pancetta and place back in the oven for about 5 to 10 minutes until the pancetta is crisp., Once the squash has cooled down a little, shake off the pancetta and chestnuts and finely chop the squash – it will be quite mushy but that’s fine. I go for half of it fine and half chunky. Add this to the risotto at the end of Stage 3. Carry on as normal through the basic recipe, season to taste and serve with the pancetta, chestnuts, sage leaves and squash seeds sprinkled over the top., Lovely served with a big dollop of mascarpone cheese on the side., Try this: Place a grater and a block of Parmesan cheese in the middle of the table so that everyone can help themselves."

In a separate pan, heat the butter, then add the onion, bacon and thyme and fry for about 8 minutes until the onion is soft but not coloured. Add the rice and turn up the heat so it almost fries., After a minute the rice will look slightly translucent. Add the wine and keep stirring., Now add a ladle of hot stock and a pinch of salt. Turn down the heat to a fairly high simmer. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring constantly and allowing each ladleful to be absorbed completely before adding the next., Chuck the peas into the stock when there are a couple of ladlefuls left, and add them with the stock. Stir until the rice is soft but still has a slight bite, then season with salt and pepper., Remove from the heat and stir in half the goat's cheese and the Parmesan. Sprinkle the remaining goat's cheese over the top and eat as soon as possible while it retains its lovely moist texture., Tip: Leave out the bacon and use vegetable stock if you want to make a vegetarian risotto."

Have a go at mastering it – you’ll be amazed at the light and fluffy results., Once you’ve got the hang of that, you can have a go at flavouring it - any flavouring you boil with the rice will infuse it with wonderful fragrances and flavours. So try boiling things like fresh herbs, a cinnamon stick, a few cardamom pods, a strip of lemon zest or even a green tea bag in the water with the rice., Doubling the amounts in the recipe will give you enough rice to serve 8-12 people., Put a large pan of salted water on a high heat and bring to the boil. Rinse the rice in a colander under running water for about 1 minute, or until the water runs clear (this will stop the grains sticking together later). Add your rice to the boiling water and wait for the grains to start dancing around. From that point, boil for 5 minutes, Drain the rice in a colander. Pour 2.5cm of water into the pan, put it back on the heat and bring it to the boil again, then turn down to a simmer. Cover the rice in the colander with foil or a lid. Place the colander on top of the pan of simmering water and let the rice steam over it for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and if you’re ready, serve immediately. If not, leave the foil or lid on and put aside until ready to serve – it should stay warm for about 20 minutes."

This is a great way to liven up plain rice but feel free to take it a step further by adding turmeric, like my Indian friend Das. Or hot it up with a little chilli powder. You can also fry some broken nuts, scramble in some eggs, try any ideas or flavours that you think are apt., Throw the rice into boiling water, cook for 10 minutes and drain., Heat the oil in a small frying pan, over a medium heat. Add the mustard seeds and as they begin to pop add the urad dhal, curry leaves and strips of lemon rind (remove these with a vegetable peeler). Leave to cook for 1 minute until the urad dhal and lemon peel are lightly coloured., Add the drained steaming rice to a bowl and pour over the cooked spices, lemon juice and chopped coriander. Season to taste. Serve with a good curry."

many different ways, depending on what kind of mushrooms you have and whether they are introduced at the very beginning of cooking or just added at the end, as I’m going to do here. The inspiration for this recipe came when I was in Japan and saw mushrooms being cooked completely dry on a barbecue or griddle pan. This way of cooking brings out a really fresh and nutty flavour in them; perfect for being dressed lightly with olive oil, salt and lemon juice or stirred into a risotto at the last minute before serving., Heat your stock in a saucepan and keep it on a low simmer. Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl and pour in just enough hot stock to cover. Leave for a couple of minutes until they’ve softened. Fish them out of the stock and chop them, reserving the soaking liquid., In a large pan, heat a lug of olive oil and add the onion and celery. Slowly fry without colouring them for at least 10 minutes, then turn the heat up and add the rice. Give it a stir. Stir in the vermouth or wine – it’ll smell fantastic! Keep stirring until the liquid has cooked into the rice. Now pour the porcini soaking liquid through a sieve into the pan and add the chopped porcini, a good pinch of salt and your first ladle of hot stock. Turn the heat down to a simmer and keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next., Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. This will take about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, get a dry griddle pan hot and grill the wild mushrooms until soft. If your pan isn’t big enough, do this in batches. Put them into a bowl and add the chopped herbs, a pinch of salt and the lemon juice. Using your hands, get stuck in and toss everything together – this is going to be incredible!, Take the risotto off the heat and check the seasoning carefully. Stir in the butter and the Parmesan. You want it to be creamy and oozy in texture, so add a bit more stock if you think it needs it. Put a lid on and leave the risotto to relax for about 3 minutes., Take your risotto and add a little more seasoning or Parmesan if you like. Serve a good dollop of risotto topped with some grilled dressed mushrooms, a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

It works really well with the ricotta in this recipe and has a fantastic sweetness. Please don’t buy the crappy ricotta that a lot of the supermarkets have – make sure it’s light and crumbly and, if you’re out of luck, a fresh goat’s cheese is pretty damn good too., Put your fennel seeds into a pestle and mortar and bash up to a powder. Get a wide, hot saucepan, add a couple of splashes of olive oil and fry the garlic until softened, then add the bashed fennel seeds and sliced fennel. Add a pinch of salt and pepper and turn down to a medium-low heat. Place a lid on the pan and cook nice and slowly for around 20 minutes, until the fennel’s soft and sweet., Start the risotto bianco as usual and continue through the recipe until the rice is half cooked. Half-way through Stage 3, stir in the sautéd fennel, then keep cooking the risotto until the rice is perfectly cooked., Bash up the dried chillies in the pestle and mortar until you have a fine powder. At Stage 4, when you add the butter and Parmesan, add the crumbled ricotta and lemon zest. Check the seasoning carefully and balance the flavour with as much lemon juice as you feel it needs to work with the fennel. Divide between your plates, sprinkle over your fennel tops and dust with the ground chilli. Grate over some fresh Parmesan at the table."
Asparagus & mint risotto| Rice recipes | Jamie Oliver recipes,"Simple, clean & delicious flavours","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/oldImages/large/31_1_1439297253.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '8']",5 minutes,"“ 
This is such a simple, clean and delicious risotto. When buying asparagus, have a look around because there are lots of varieties available now - purple-tipped, white, thin straggly Japanese, wild Spanish and dozens of good locally grown English. In this recipe, the stalks are finely sliced to an inch below the tips - this will give you lots of flavour from the stalks and you'll then have those whole beautiful tips as a bit of a prize! There are variations on this risotto that I love to do, like sprinkling in a little picked crab or lobster meat or fresh, peeled prawns or sliced scallops - all of these work particularly well with asparagus if you fancy a little upgrade. (If you do decide to add any of these seafood suggestions, then reduce your Parmesan by half.) ”",395,8.9g,4.1g,3g,0.2g,9.3g,61.9g,2.4g,"RISOTTO BASE, 1

You need small artichokes for this dish – not the large globe ones. When things like artichokes or courgettes are sliced thinly the Italians call this trifolati, which literally translates as ‘in the style of truffles’, i.e. wafer thin. ”",509,20.8g,11g,4.3g,2.7g,14.8g,58.2g,2.6g,"6                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                violet artichokes, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 1                                                                                                                                                                x                                                                                                                                                                risotto bianco, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh mint                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), extra virgin olive oil, Parmesan cheese                                                                                                                                                                , for grating","Peel the artichokes back to their pale, light leaves, then halve them and remove the hairy chokes with a teaspoon. Immerse the artichokes in water with half the lemon juice, with a heavy lid or heat-resistant dish placed on top of them to keep them immersed and stop them discolouring., Start your risotto bianco and when you begin stage 3, drop 6 of your prepared artichoke halves into the simmering stock. Continue cooking the risotto, adding the stock a ladleful at a time until the rice is half-cooked., Slice the remaining artichoke halves very finely and stir into the risotto. Continue stirring the stock into the rice. At stage 4, when the rice is cooked and you have added the butter and Parmesan, stir in the rest of the lemon juice. Take the pan off the heat and check the seasoning., Pick and tear up the mint leaves. Remove the cooked artichokes from the stock pan and toss with most of the lemon zest, the torn-up mint leaves and a splash of olive oil., Spoon the risotto onto 4 plates and place the dressed artichokes on top. Drizzle with any remaining dressing from the bowl and serve sprinkled with extra Parmesan and the rest of the lemon zest."

Stirring all the time, gently bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer until almost all the stock has been absorbed. Add the rest of the stock a ladleful at a time until the rice is cooked. You might not need all your stock. Be careful not to overcook the rice – check it throughout cooking to make sure it’s a pleasure to eat. It should hold its shape but be soft, creamy and oozy. And the overall texture should be slightly looser than you think you want it., Turn off the heat, beat in your butter, Parmesan, gorgonzola, goat’s cheese, chopped apple and marjoram. Check the seasoning and add salt and pepper if needed. Put a lid on the pan and leave the risotto to rest for a minute so the cheese can really ooze into it. While you’re waiting, gently heat the walnuts in a pan. Then either take the risotto to the table and let everyone help themselves, or divide it between individual serving plates. Put a block of Parmesan on the table for grating over. Sprinkle with the walnuts and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil before tucking in."

Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, trim and finely chop the celery. Finely grate the Parmesan., In a separate pan, heat the oil and 1 small knob of butter over a low heat, add the onions, garlic and celery, and fry gently for about 15 minutes, or until softened but not coloured., Add the rice and turn up the heat – the rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep stirring it. After 1 minute it will look slightly translucent. Add the vermouth or wine and keep stirring — it will smell fantastic. Any harsh alcohol flavours will evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty essence., Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of sea salt. Turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn’t cook too quickly on the outside., Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and almost massaging the creamy starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take around 15 minutes. Taste the rice — is it cooked? Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. Don’t forget to check the seasoning carefully. If you run out of stock before the rice is cooked, add some boiling water., Remove the pan from the heat, add 1 knob of butter and the Parmesan, then stir well., Place a lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 minutes – this is the most important part of making the perfect risotto, as this is when it becomes outrageously creamy and oozy like it should be. Eat it as soon as possible, while the risotto retains its beautiful texture."

and slice the onions and garlic, peel and finely grate the ginger., Put all this into a large high-sided roasting tray with the curry paste and a lug of groundnut oil. Toss together until well coated, then roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until sticky and caramelized., Remove half the roasted veg to a large pan to start your daal and return the tray to the oven to keep warm – turn the oven off so that the veg don’t dry out., Place the pan on a low heat on the hob. Stir in the split peas, crumble in the stock cube and add 2 litres of boiling water., Simmer for around 1 hour 20 minutes with the lid on, or until the split peas are tender and the daal has thickened, stirring occasionally, and adding splashes of water to loosen, if needed., Meanwhile, place the flour in a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt and make a well in the middle. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 150ml of water to the well and mix together with a fork., When it comes together as dough, tip it on to a flour-dusted surface, knead until smooth, then divide into 12 balls. Roll each one into a circle, nice and thin, turning as you go and dusting with a little extra flour, if needed., Put a frying pan on a medium heat and cook the chapatis for 1 minute on each side, or until cooked but not coloured. Stack them in tin foil as you go and keep them warm until needed., Put 1 mug of rice and 2 mugs of boiling water into a pan with a pinch of salt. Cook on a medium heat with the lid on for 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed., Meanwhile, to make the flavoured oil (called a temper), finely slice the chilli and place it in a small frying pan on a medium heat with the curry leaves, mustard seeds and a good lug of groundnut oil for 1 to 2 minutes, or until crispy., Load up your warm chapatis with rice, daal and a scattering of roasted veggies, drizzle over the temper, roll up and tuck in."
