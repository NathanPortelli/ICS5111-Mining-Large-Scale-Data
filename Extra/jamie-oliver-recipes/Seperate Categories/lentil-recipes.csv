coriander and chilli in a mixing bowl. Season with salt and black pepper and leave for about 10 minutes before serving. This will allow the flavours to marinate and will also remove some of the liquid from the cucumber, providing a less watery crunch., Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat and cook the onion for 3–5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft. Add the grated broccoli stem, lentils, garlic and sundried tomatoes and cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring occasionally., Add all the remaining ingredients and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens and begins to stick to the pan. Stir in 1–2 tablespoons of water for the last minute of cooking. Remove from the heat and cover with a lid while you warm the tortillas., To serve, spoon the lentil and broccoli stem mixture onto warm tortillas and top with Cucumber Salsa, fresh coriander and basil, with lime wedges on the side."

cardamom pods in a pestle and mortar and pick just the inner seeds into the mortar, discarding the husks. Finely grind the seeds with the cloves and a pinch of sea salt into a dust, then mix in the curry powder., Peel the garlic, ginger, onion and carrots, then finely chop with the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves in a bowl of cold water). Place it all in a large pan on a medium-low heat with the butter and two-thirds of the spice mix. Cook for 10 minutes, or until soft and lightly golden, stirring occasionally., Stir in the lentils and the chickpeas (juice and all), and add enough water so everything is just covered. Simmer on a low heat for 40 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through and it's thick and delicious, stirring occasionally., Remove from the heat, taste, and season to perfection. Stir in the frozen peas and leave to cool. Once cool, finely chop and stir through the coriander leaves, along with the lemon juice., Unroll your packet of filo. Lay the sheets out in front of you, with the long edges nearest to you. Lightly brush them all with oil and sprinkle over most of the remaining spice mix from a height, then cut each sheet into three fat strips, giving you 18 in total., Divide up the filling, placing 1 level tablespoon near the bottom of each strip. One at a time, shape the filling into a neat cylinder, leaving a 2cm border at the bottom and sides. Fold in the sides and loosely roll them up (to prevent them from cracking), sealing the edges with a little oil., Repeat until they're all wrapped up, spacing them out on an oiled tray as you go. Brush with a little more oil and scatter over the rest of the spice mix, then chill until needed., Bake in a preheated oven at 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 for 15 to 20 minutes, or until crisp, golden and hot through, then serve sprinkled with baby mint leaves and with dips of your choice on the side. I like to liquidize ripe mango flesh with yoghurt for one dip, and cucumber, fresh mint and yoghurt for the other. Just remember to season your dips to perfection before you serve them."

Carefully slice at just under ½cm intervals all the way along, putting the veg into a large roasting tray as you go., Peel the garlic and place in a pestle and mortar, strip in the thyme leaves, then bash to a paste and muddle in 6 tablespoons of oil, the vinegar, and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Toss well with the veg, then roast for 1 hour, or until golden and caramelised, turning halfway., Remove all the veg to a board and place the tray over a medium heat on the hob. Pour in the wine and leave to bubble and cook away, scraping up all the sticky caramelised bits from the bottom of the tray., Tip in the lentils (juices and all) and spinach, then stir until the juices have thickened and the leaves have wilted., Season to taste with salt and pepper, ripple through the yoghurt, then present to the table with the board of veg.

Tip back into the pan, finely grate in the lemon zest and squeeze in half the juice, season to taste, then cover., Peel and finely chop the garlic and ginger, then half, deseed and finely chop the chilli. Peel and finely slice the onion., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over a medium heat, add the garlic, ginger and chilli, followed by all the spices and fry for 2 minutes to coat., Pick and roughly chop the coriander leaves (keep to one side), then finely chop and add the stalks to the pan., Add the onion and cook for a further 6 to 8 minutes, or until softened, adding a splash more of oil, if needed., Trim and roughly chop the mushrooms and tomatoes. Add the mushrooms to the pan and stir-fry for a few minutes, then add the tomatoes, lentils and 200ml of boiling water. Bring to the boil, cover with a lid and cook over a medium-low heat for around 20 minutes, or until the lentils are tender., At this stage, remove the lid, turn the heat up to medium-high and leave to bubble away until the sauce thickens and reduces slightly, stirring occasionally., Stir through the yoghurt, then season to taste with sea salt and black pepper., Divide the curry and lemony rice between your plates, scatter over the coriander leaves, then tuck in."

then roughly slice the dried cranberries. Peel and finely slice the onion., Add the sage and cranberries to the pork meat, and crumble in the chestnuts. Season, then mix well and stuff into the cavities of each partridge, leaving enough space for the air to circulate around the filling., Roll any leftover stuffing into balls. Rub olive oil, sea salt and black pepper all over the birds, then drape the pancetta or bacon over the breasts. Top each bird with a sprig of thyme, securing everything with string., Put the partridges into the hot tray with a lug of ale and any stuffing balls, then cook for 15 to 18 minutes (depending on the size of your birds), then remove the partridges and stuffing to a warm plate, covering with foil and a tea towel – don’t wash the roasting tray though.

Meanwhile, put the lentils in a pan and cover with 2cm or so of water. Add the rosemary, remaining thyme, bay, unpeeled garlic cloves and the onion., Squeeze the cherry tomatoes into the pan, if you’ve got them. Bring to the boil, then turn down and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the lentils are soft but holding their shape – the time will vary according to the type of lentil, so check the packet instructions., At this point, you only want 1cm of water, so drain away any extra, then add a swig of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar., Fish out the herb sprigs and the garlic cloves. Squeeze the garlic flesh out of the skins and into the lentils. Mix up, then season to taste. Stir through the baby spinach, then put the lentils onto a platter.

Add the blueberry jam to the roasting tray and stir it into all the lovely bits from the bottom of the tray.

Pick the coriander leaves and set aside, then finely slice the stalks., Place a large saucepan over a medium-low heat and pour in a lug of oil. Sauté the garlic, chilli and coriander stalks for a minute, until lightly golden., Add the red lentils to the pan. Stir to coat, then pour in the hot stock and coconut milk., Turn up the heat, gently bring it to the boil, then let it come to a simmer. Cook the lentils for 20 minutes, or until they are completely broken down., When the veggies are ready, remove from the oven and carefully spoon into the pan. Add most of the coriander leaves, then blitz the soup with a stick blender until it’s creamy but still has a little texture., Squeeze in some lemon juice to taste and adjust the seasoning if need be.

Cover with cold water, bring it to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. Drain again, and set the ham aside., To make the chilli oil, place the groundnut oil in a pan over a very low heat. Peel the garlic and finely slice along with the chillies, then add to the pan and warm through for 5 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn’t brown. Set aside to steep while making the soup (the oil can be strained before using, or left as is)., For the soup, peel and roughly chop the onion and ginger (keep them separate), then scrub and roughly chop the parsnips., Heat a glug of olive oil in a large pan and add the onion. Cook gently, stirring often, for 5 minutes, then add the parsnips, rogan josh paste and ginger, and cook for a further 5 minutes., Add the lentils, stock (if using) or the same amount of hot water and the ham hock and bring to the boil. Simmer for about 30 minutes, until the lentils are nice and soft., Remove and discard the ham bone and liquidise the soup until smooth. Return any lean ham to the saucepan and reheat., Finely shred the mint leaves and serve scattered on top of the soup with a dollop of yoghurt and a swirl of the chilli oil."

Take them out and drain well on kitchen paper., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., When the aubergines are cool enough to handle, scrape out the flesh with a spoon, being careful not to pierce the skin. Roughly chop the flesh and place it in a large bowl, and arrange the skins in a baking dish., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan over a low-medium heat, then add the garlic and onion and gently fry for 3 to 4 minutes, until soft. Stir in the cumin and cook for another minute., Add the garlicky onion to the bowl of aubergine along with the cooked rice, lentils, raisins and half of the dill, mix well and season to taste., Stuff the aubergine skins with the rice mixture, and place them back in the baking dish. Drizzle over oil and roast for 25 minutes, until golden., To make the tomato sauce, place all of the ingredients in a pan over a low-medium heat and simmer gently for 4 to 5 minutes, until thickened. Blitz with a hand blender until smooth., Spoon the sauce over the stuffed aubergines and serve with the feta crumbled over and the remaining dill scattered on top."

Add the onions, coriander stalks and jalapeño and sauté for 10 minutes, until softened but not coloured. Stir in the coriander seeds, fry for a couple more minutes, then add the lentils., Stir in 800ml boiling water and bring back to the boil. Season well, reduce the heat, pop on the lid and simmer for 40 minutes, until the lentils are cooked and beginning to break down., Blacken the peppers by either placing them directly on a gas flame, or griddling them in a griddle pan, turning regularly until blackened all over. Pop them in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and let stand., After about 5 minutes the peppers should be ready, so flake away the blistered skin and remove the stalk and seeds. Slice the flesh into thin strips and leave to one side., Place the chipotle chilli in a small bowl and pour in just enough boiling water to cover. After a few minutes, it should have softened; carefully remove from the bowl and finely chop., Place a medium-sized pan over a medium heat and pour in a lug of olive oil. Add the garlic and all the chillies and fry for 1 minute, then add the peppers and paprika. Fry for a few more minutes, then add the tomatoes., Season well and gradually bring everything to a simmer. Leave to bubble away gently for 10 minutes, until you have a thick and rich tomato sauce. Add a splash of red wine vinegar and set aside. Chop the coriander leaves, then stir through., When your lentils are cooked, roughly purée with a stick blender, then pop back over a medium heat with a lug of oil. Fry for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, so you end up with crispy fried lentils., Place a frying pan over a medium heat and add a splash of oil. Crack in the eggs, one at a time, and cook to your liking. Slice the avocados and dress with the juice of 1 lime. Cut the remaining lime into quarters., Serve the refried lentils with a dollop of the red pepper salsa, dressed avocado and topped with a fried egg and a wedge of lime."

Next add the mango chutney and taste for seasoning., Pull the chicken apart with forks and stir it through. Serve with wholemeal basmati rice and yoghurt on the side, if you like."

lentils","Preheat the oven to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3., Pick and finely chop the thyme and rosemary leaves. Trim, wash and roughly chop the leeks, trim and finely chop the celery, then peel and finely chop the carrots., Place a large stew pot on a medium-high heat with the oil and the herbs. Fry for a couple of minutes, then add the chopped veg and cook for a further 8 to 10 minutes, or until softened a little, stirring regularly., Add the meat and continue to fry until browned all over and the juices have bubbled away. Stir the flour into the pan, then add the tomato purée, horseradish, stock and bay., Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to low. Crumple up and wet a piece of greaseproof paper, then open it out and place on top of the stew. Cover with a lid and pop in the oven for 2 hours., At this stage, remove the greaseproof and skim away any fat from the surface, then top up with 200ml of water. Sprinkle in the lentils, then replace the greaseproof, cover and pop back in the oven for a further 30 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through., When the time’s up, remove the bay leaf and give the stew a good stir to make sure that nothing has stuck to the bottom of the pan. If the stew is a bit thick, add a little boiling water to thin it down. If it’s a bit thin, sit the pot on the hob and simmer gently until the liquid reduces to your desired consistency., Taste the stew and season with freshly ground black pepper, if necessary. Delicious served with mashed or baked potato and some lemony dressed greens."

Top and tail the onions. Bring a saucepan of water to the boil over a medium heat, add the onions and simmer for about 25 minutes, until tender and easily pierced by the point of a knife., Drain the onions and allow to cool slightly. Cut them in half and, using a teaspoon, scoop out and reserve the flesh, leaving three layers intact to form your shells., Carefully slice the reserved onion flesh as finely as possible. Heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the sliced onion and fry for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Turn up the heat and cook for another 25 minutes, until the onion is deeply golden and crisp. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and season well., Preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4. Wipe the onion pan clean with kitchen towel and add the crushed cumin and coriander seeds. Toast over a medium heat for a couple of minutes, or until fragrant., Add the remaining olive oil along with the rice, lentils, turmeric, allspice, cinnamon and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Stir to coat the rice with oil, then add the stock, bring up to the boil, cover tightly and simmer over a very low heat for 25–30 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove the lid, cover with a tea towel, pop the lid back on and set aside for 10 minutes., Stir through the fried onions, toasted almonds and most of the chopped parsley. Season and spoon the mixture into the soft onion shells, filling them generously, then sandwich two sides together and place in an oiled baking dish, spooning any extra filling around the edges., Sprinkle over the red wine vinegar and sugar, cover the dish tightly with tinfoil and bake in the oven for 25 minutes, removing the foil for the last 5 minutes. Scatter with the remaining flaked almonds. Serve the stuffed onions warm, with a rocket salad on the side."

Peel and trim the parsnips, cutting them into batons approximately 5cm long and 1cm thick. Finely chop the shallot and crush the garlic for the dressing., Bring the stock to the boil, add the lentils and bay leaf and simmer gently for 25–30 minutes, or until the lentils are just tender but still retain some bite. Drain the lentils, discard the bay and set aside., Place the walnuts on a baking tray and toast in the oven until lightly browned and fragrant. Remove the tray from the oven, carefully scoop out the walnuts, and add the parsnips in their place. Drizzle with the olive oil and roast for 35 minutes until golden., Make the dressing by whisking together the walnut oil, vinegar, honey and mustard. Season and stir in the garlic and shallots., In a bowl, toss together the lentils, walnuts, parsnips and dressing.

then trim and finely chop the leek and chilli (I leave the seeds in, but deseed if you prefer), and place into your largest, heavy-based pan over a medium heat with the oil. Fry for about 5 minutes, or until softened., Add the spices, dried herbs and a good grating of nutmeg, then fry for 2 minutes – if it’s a little dry at this point, simply add a splash of water to help it out. Stir in the tomato purée and cook for a further 2 minutes., Stir in the lentils. Drain, rinse and stir in the beans, followed by the chopped tomatoes and the stock (I try to use homemade stock, but if you’ve only got stock cubes, that’s fine too)., Bring it all to the boil, then reduce to a low heat and let it bubble away for at least 1 hour, or until thickened and reduced, stirring every 15 to 20 minutes, then season to how you like it., I like this with rice or on a jacket potato, scattered with coriander leaves and with lime wedges and a dollop of soured cream on the side."

half into wedges for serving later, then squeeze the juice of the other half on to a large plate and add 1 tablespoon of tikka paste., Mix together, then massage all over the frozen fish and leave aside in a single layer to marinate and defrost., Peel and slice the onion, garlic and ginger with the chilli and coriander stalks, then place it all in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with a lug of oil and the remaining tikka paste., Peel the potatoes, cut them into 2cm chunks, then stir them into the pan and cook everything for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally. This will build up great flavour., Quarter the tomatoes, add to the pan with the cauliflower, lentils and 600ml of boiling water, and bring back to the boil. Simmer for 45 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through and the sauce is lovely and thick, adding splashes of water, if needed, then season to perfection., Around 15 minutes before the curry is ready, put 1 mug (320g) of rice and 2 mugs of boiling water into a pan with a pinch of sea salt and the cloves. Cook on a medium heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed., Dry-fry the fish in a large non-stick pan for 3 to 5 minutes per side (depending on the thickness), or until charred, gnarly and cooked through – don’t be tempted to move it around, just let it colour and crisp up nicely., Stir half the yoghurt through the curry and dollop the remaining yoghurt on top. Fluff up the rice, flake the fish on top, then sprinkle with coriander leaves and serve alongside the curry, with lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Finely chop the bacon., Heat a lug of olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat, add the bacon and fry slowly until the bacon starts to release all its tasty fat and goes crispy, then crumble in the dried chilli, and add the dried thyme, onion, carrot, celery and garlic., Cook gently with the lid on for about 15 minutes, or until all the vegetables are soft, then add the lentils and 1 litre water or vegetable stock., Bring to the boil and simmer until the lentils are soft (check the packet instructions as different types of lentils vary in cooking time. If you’re mixing your lentils, cook for the longest amount of time to make sure they are all cooked properly)., Drain, then tip in the cannellini beans and, if the soup’s a little thick, add a splash more water. Bring back to the boil and simmer for another 10 minutes, then taste and season with sea salt and black pepper., Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley., Ladle into bowls and finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and the chopped parsley. Serve with hunks of bread for dunking."

Put a little olive oil into a pan, add the onion and sliced garlic, throw in the cinnamon stick and a good crumbling of chilli, and fry on a gentle heat for 10 minutes until the onions are soft and sweet. Now turn the heat up and add your red wine vinegar – it will steam and might even make you cough but this is a normal reaction! Then turn the heat down to low and add your tinned tomatoes, chopped up. Simmer slowly for half an hour while you get on with your lentils., Put a pan of water on for your broccoli and preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Put the lentils into a pot, cover them with water, and add the 2 whole cloves of garlic, the bay leaf and some tied-up stalks from the parsley. Simmer for around 20 minutes, making sure that you’ve got enough liquid covering the lentils. Toss your sausages in a little olive oil and put them in a roasting tray in the preheated oven for 25 minutes or until golden and crisp. Drop your broccoli into boiling water for a few minutes when the sausages come out of the oven. When done, drain in a colander and toss in a bowl with a squeeze of lemon juice and some extra virgin olive oil., Once the lentils are cooked, remove the parsley stalks and bay leaf and pour away most of the water from the pan. Mash the garlic cloves up with a spoon, mix in with the lentils and dress them using 4 tablespoons of good extra virgin olive oil and 1 or 2 tablespoons of good vinegar. Throw in all your finely chopped parsley leaves, mix and season., Remove the sausages from the roasting tray and pour away any fat. Tip the lentils into your serving bowls. Remove the cinnamon stick from the salsa rossa and discard it, then season well to taste and spoon it over your lentils. Place 2 sausages, either sliced or whole, on top. Sprinkle with the thyme and serve with a big bowl of steaming broccoli."

baby spinach","Start by making a temper. Peel the garlic, then finely slice with the chillies, ideally 1mm thick on a mandolin (use the guard!)., Pour 2 tablespoons of oil into a large wide pan on a medium heat and add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and curry leaves for 1 minute, then the garlic and chillies., Stir so everything’s flat, moving regularly until crisp and lightly golden. With a slotted spoon, remove half the temper to a plate, taking the pan off the heat., Peel the onions and ginger and finely chop with the coriander stalks, then chop the squash into 2cm cubes, leaving the skin on but discarding any seeds. Stir it all into the pan and return to a medium heat for 15 minutes to soften., Stir in the lentils, then 1.5 litres of boiling water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer and cover for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally., Mash the squash into the daal, taste and season to perfection. Remove 6 portions, bag them up and, once completely cool, freeze for a rainy day when you’ll be really grateful it’s there, leaving the rest on a low heat to keep warm., Blitz the coriander leaves, yoghurt, a pinch of sea salt and half the lime juice in a blender until smooth, then decant into a small bowl., Reheat the reserved temper in a non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat with 1 teaspoon of oil, then divide into two piles and crack an egg over each. Cover and leave to slowly fry on the bottom for 2 or 3 minutes, while they coddle on top., One-by-one, puff up your dry poppadoms in the microwave for around 30 seconds each., Top each portion of daal with a fried egg, and pop some spinach, dressing, poppadoms and a lime wedge on the side."
