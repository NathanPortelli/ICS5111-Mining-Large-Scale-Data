Once hot, put 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the remaining mint leaves in to crisp up for 1 minute, then scoop the leaves on to a plate, leaving the oil behind., Season the scallops with sea salt and black pepper and fry for 2 minutes on each side, or until golden. Crumble in the black pudding (discarding the skin) so it crisps up alongside., Drain the peas and potatoes, return to the pan, mash well with the chopped mint and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, taste and season to perfection., Plate up with the scallops and black pudding, drizzle lightly with extra virgin olive oil, and sprinkle over the crispy mint."

minutes, or until sizzling, then pour in the stock and bring to the boil., Add the peas and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes, then stir in the jaggery or sugar and tamarind paste. Season to taste, then use a stick blender to purée until smooth. Set aside., For the scallops, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Add the mustard seeds and stir continuously until they pop., Mix in the turmeric and curry leaves, followed by the scallops, frying for about 1 minute on each side, until they are cooked through and beginning to brown., Reheat the soup (don’t let it boil or it will lose its freshness), then taste, adding lime juice if you feel it needs extra tang., Divide between warmed bowls and spoon on the spiced scallops and curry leaves to finish."

lightly score the skin, then lightly score the scallops in a criss-cross pattern. Peel the prawns, leaving the heads and tails on (for bonus flavour), then run the tip of a knife down their backs and pull out the vein. Put it all into a bowl., Pick through the mussels and clams, discarding any that remain open when tapped. Put aside in a separate bowl., To make the marinade, trim the lemongrass, peel the garlic and ginger, then roughly chop with the lime leaves, half the chilli (deseed first, if you like) and the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves). Scrape into a pestle and mortar and bash to a smooth paste., Muddle in the fish and soy sauces, squeeze in the juice of 1 lime, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., Quarter the bok choi, halve the sugar snaps lengthways, trim the broccoli, then slice the choi sum into 5cm chunks., Tear off a 60cm-long piece of wide tin foil and place a slightly smaller piece of greaseproof paper on top. Pile on the greens, add the fish and seafood, then drizzle over the marinade., Beat the egg and brush it around the foil edges, then place another large piece of foil on top. Leaving about 5cm around the filling, fold in the foil to create a sealed parcel., Place on a baking tray, being careful not to pierce the foil, and place the tray on the bottom of the oven for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, put the rice and coconut cream into a medium pan with twice the volume of boiling salted water. Bring to the boil, then cover and cook on a low heat until tender., Remove the fish parcel from the oven and very carefully cut it open (mind out for the steam!). Place on a platter, discarding any mussels or clams that haven’t opened., Finely slice and scatter over the remaining chilli, tear over the coriander leaves, and serve with the rice and lime wedges for squeezing over."

then chop the chillies, lemongrass and coriander, including the stalks., Place in a pestle and mortar or blender with the remaining paste ingredients and either pound or blitz till you’ve got a thick, aromatic paste., Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Peel the lime zest and add to the water with the rice, and wait for the grains to start dancing around. Boil for 5 minutes, then drain in a sieve., Pour 2.5cm of water into the pan, put it back on the heat, bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer. Cover the rice in the sieve with tin foil and place on top of the pan for 8 minutes, or until tender., Place another large pan over a medium heat. Add the sesame oil, then the spice paste, and fry for a minute or so to get the flavours going., Add the coconut milk, chicken stock and lime juice. Give it a stir, add the whole dried chillies, then bring to the boil and turn down to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes., Cut the monkfish into 1cm slices, then halve the scallops., Add the langoustines to the pan and cook for 3 minutes, then add your fish and scallops and cook for 3 more minutes. The fish won’t need long, so once it’s cooked through and the langoustines have turned bright red and their tails have curled up, take the stew off the heat., Add a few dashes of soy sauce to taste. Put some rice into each bowl, then ladle over that incredible stew, making sure everyone gets a langoustine and pieces of fish and scallops. Just watch out for those dried chillies if you aren’t a chilli freak like me!"

Place the oil and butter in a pan to melt. Meanwhile, finely chop the garlic and chilli (keep the seeds in if you like the heat), then add to the pan with the black pepper. Give it a good stir, let all the ingredients party, then set aside., Place the shells with the scallops inside them on a platter, then add a dash of white wine to each one. Using tongs, place each shell directly on the grey coals, carefully positioning them so they can’t tip over. Cover with the lid like an outdoor oven and cook for 4 to 6 minutes, or until cooked through, turning the scallops halfway with tongs. Carefully remove the shells to a serving platter and drizzle about 1 tablespoon of the melted chilli garlic butter over each golden scallop. Roughly chop and scatter over the parsley leaves then serve right away., Tip:  ￼Ask your fishmonger to prep and clean the scallops for you. You’ll be cooking them in their shells, so make sure you ask for these too."

Place over a high heat and bring to the boil, then cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender., Meanwhile, using a sharp knife, roughly chop the bacon into chunky lardons, roughly ½cm thick. Score the scallops in a criss-cross fashion about 1cm deep on one side, season with a pinch of salt, then set aside., Drain and allow the potatoes to steam dry, then return to the empty pan with the milk, a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mash until smooth, then cover until needed., Heat a splash of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, then add the bacon and fry for around 2 minutes, or until golden. Move the bacon to one side of the pan, then pick the sage leaves into the space. Cook for 1 minute, or until crisp, then move to the side of the pan along with the bacon. Add the remaining butter and the scallops, cut-side down, to the empty space. Cook for around 2 minutes, or until golden, turning halfway., Remove from the heat, add a squeeze of lemon juice and toss to coat, allowing the scallops to cook in the hot pan for a further 30 seconds. Divide the creamy mash between plates, then spoon over the scallops, bacon, sage and any lovely juices from the pan, then tuck in."

They’re at their best when the water is really cold, and if there’s a good fishmonger near you they should be able to track them down., The richness of the black pudding works really well with the clean taste of the scallops. And, if you haven’t eaten the roe (the orange bit on the scallop) before, give it a go. Just carefully trim them off the scallops then fry them for some added tastiness!, Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas mark 4. Tear the ciabatta into rough pieces and place in a baking tray. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Pop in the oven and cook for 10 minutes until you’ve got crispy, golden croutons., Put all the salad leaves in a big bowl. Finely slice the celery at an angle and add it to the bowl of salad with the celery leaves., Heat a frying pan on a medium heat. Split the black puddings lengthways, tear them open, crumble into the frying pan and fry until crispy. Don’t be scared if it looks very black and almost burnt - trust me, it will taste delicious. Once ready, remove to a plate and keep warm., Carefully slice the scallops in half so you have 2 rounds from each scallop and score them on one side with a little criss-cross. Season with a little salt and pepper and a sprinkling of lemon zest. Sear for a minute in a frying pan, scored-side down, with a touch of olive oil, and don’t be tempted to touch them! Add the roe to the pan now, too. After a minute, check the underside, and continue to fry until lovely and caramelised. Turn them over and allow the other side to do the same. Be careful not to overcook them though, a minute or so on each side is all they need., Arrange the salad leaves on a large platter, then nestle the lovely scallops in among them. Sprinkle over that wonderful, crispy black pudding and the croutons. Snip the salad cress over the top, and finish with a good squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil. What an amazing treat!"

When the temperature has reached 180°C, or slightly lower (check your thermometer), and the smoke and flames have died down, you can start cooking. Always keep an eye on the fire and top up the heat source, if needed., Clean and wash the shellfish, pulling the beards off the mussels and throwing away any open ones., Peel the garlic and bash with a good pinch of sea salt in a pestle and mortar until creamy, then finely grate in the lemon zest. Add a good pinch of black pepper and pour in enough oil to make a dressing., Tip the shellfish into a large roasting tray and drizzle with the dressing. Toss everything together, then spread the shellfish out into an even layer., Halve the lemons, add them to the tray, then slide the tray into the hot oven and roast for 10 minutes or until all the shells have opened and the prawns and scallops are golden and cooked through. Keep an eye on them and rotate the tray for even cooking., Pick and chop the herb leaves and serve the shellfish straight away, scattered with chopped herbs, and with lots of napkins!"

Always buy the freshest scallops you can find and pat them dry before cooking them., Give the butter a whiz in a food processor with the mint leaves, a pinch or two of salt and pepper and the zest of the lemon., Lay a sheet of greaseproof paper (roughly A4 size) on your kitchen surface and dollop all of the flavoured butter in the middle of it. Roll the butter into a sausage shape and cut a good-sized amount off the end to use later. Twist the ends of the paper so it looks like a Christmas cracker. Then pop it in the fridge to use up that week or put it in the freezer and take slices off as and when you need it., Place a griddle pan on a high heat and get a saucepan of salted water boiling at the same time. Once the griddle is hot, toss your scallops in a little olive oil and season them with salt and pepper. If there is roe on your scallops (orange stuff, also known as coral), prick it with a knife before putting the scallops in the pan, or it will burst. Grill the scallops on each side for a minute or so until they’re cooked through and golden on each side., When you’ve turned the scallops once, add your pancetta or bacon to the griddle and cook until crisp and golden brown. Just before everything is ready to come out of the pan, put your pancetta or bacon on top of the scallops so the fat drips down and flavours them., While that’s going, snap the woody ends off the asparagus stalks and throw them away, keeping the delicate tips. Drop these tips in the boiling water and cook for a minute before adding the frozen peas. Cook for a minute more, drain well and put in a bowl to flavour. Toss the cooked veg in some olive oil, a good squeeze of lemon, salt and pepper and a knob (roughly 20g) of the minty butter (save the rest for another day). Put a plate on top of the bowl to keep the vegetables warm., Pile your wonderfully-flavoured vegetables onto two warmed plates and top with the pancetta or bacon, scallops and some rocket leaves. Finish by drizzling over a bit of extra virgin olive oil and serve with a nice wedge of lemon."

Score the skin of your fish fillets all over, about 1cm deep, and season., Put the fish fillets into the pan, skin side down, with the squid tentacles. Add the scallops. Run your knife down one side of each squid to open them out, then quickly and lightly score the inside in a criss-cross fashion. Lay them in the pan, scored side down., Add the asparagus and gently shake the pan. Cook for a few minutes, then turn everything over and cook on the other side. Sprinkle over the thyme tips., You’re the one in control of the pan, so if something looks cooked, take it out and keep it warm. Don’t watch things burn! When the fish has crispy skin, the scallops are golden brown with caramelized edges and the squid has curled up and is nicely chargrilled, remove the pan from the heat., Put the squid on a chopping board and roughly slice it into pieces at an angle, then return to the pan. Lay the fish fillets on each plate. Toss the asparagus, scallops and squid with half the chilli, a good drizzle of good-quality extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice. Lightly season and mix together., Divide on top of the plated fish. Sprinkle with the rest of the chopped chilli and the fennel tops, and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil."

Pour in 3 times the amount of extra virgin olive oil and add the finely chopped parsley stalks. Mix together., If you’ve got them, throw your herb branches on to the barbie so that they smoke., Drain your shellfish, then throw them onto the hottest part of the barbie. I like to put a large metal bowl or a deep roasting tray over the shellfish at this point, so they’re roasting as well as smoking., After 3 minutes use a pair of tongs to carefully lift up the side of the tray and check the shellfish have opened. Remove them to the dressing bowl, saving the lovely liquid inside as you do so. Chuck out any shellfish that haven’t opened., Sprinkle over as much chopped parsley and chilli as you like and gently mix everything together. This is wonderful finger food. I use one of the half shells to slurp up the juices. Don’t forget paper towels and maybe even a finger bowl."

Simmer for about 15 minutes or until the lentils are just cooked., Drain the lentils in a colander and throw away the garlic and sage. Season with salt, pepper and a lug of extra virgin olive oil., Wash your scallops and pat dry with kitchen paper. Put four scallops at a time on to wooden skewers. Starting at one end, loosely wrap three pieces of pancetta in and around them., Place the kebabs on a roasting tray, drizzle with olive oil and season lightly. Cook on a hot barbecue for about 10 minutes, turning three or four times until they're crispy and golden on the outside and warm all the way through., Serve with the lentils, some watercress dressed in the lemon juice and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."
