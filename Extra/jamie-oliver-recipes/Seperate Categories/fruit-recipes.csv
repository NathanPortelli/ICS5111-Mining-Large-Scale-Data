Boil the kettle. Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin with a round of greaseproof paper, rub the tin with a little olive oil and lightly dust with icing sugar., Sieve 300g of icing sugar into a large bowl and beat with the cream cheese and vanilla until smooth, then – one at a time – whisk in the eggs, and finally sieve and whisk in the flour., Pour into the lined tin, wrap the base in tin foil to protect the seal, then place inside a deep roasting tray and carefully half-fill the tray with boiling kettle water. Bake on the top shelf of the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden and loosely set in the middle, with a slight wobble. Leave to cool in the water for 15 minutes then put aside to cool completely. Cover, then chill for at least 4 hours., Meanwhile, to make the compote, place a frying pan on a medium heat with the sugar, bay leaf and Marsala wine. Split the vanilla pod lengthways, scrape out the seeds and add to the pan., Quarter the figs and add to the pan. Grate in the clementine zest and squeeze in the juice, then simmer for 15 minutes, until soft., Mix the cornflour with 100ml cold water, add to the pan and bubble for 2 minutes, or until it has a nice jammy consistency., Leave to cool slightly before serving alongside the cheesecake. If you don’t want to serve it warm, leave the compote to cool and then pop in the fridge for 4 hours. Bring it out and let it come up to room temperature before serving."

Chop the butter into cubes, then rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Remove one quarter of the mixture (about 2 big handfuls) to a separate bowl., Back to the main bowl: beat and stir in 1 egg and 1 yolk (reserving the white), then gently scrunch the dough into a ball – be careful not to overwork it. Wrap and rest in the freezer for 30 minutes., Drain the pears and put aside, reserving the juice. Pour the juice into a large casserole pan with the vanilla and finely grate in the remaining orange zest. Add the pears, frozen berries and sugar, and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, then stir in the cornflour. Bring to a boil then gently simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened slightly. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature., When you’re ready to bake, grease a deep 26cm non-stick loose-bottomed tart tin. Use a box grater to coarsely grate in the pastry, using your fingertips to press it into the base and up the sides, letting it bulge up a centimetre above the brow of the tin (don’t worry if it’s not perfect, just try to create a fairly even layer), then brush with the reserved egg white., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 and place a large baking tray at the bottom of the oven. Spoon the cooled fruit into the pastry case and scatter over the crumble topping, leaving a little border at the edges. Transfer to the tray and bake for 45 minutes, or until golden and bubbling, then let it sit in the tin to firm up. When you’re ready to serve, enjoy with scoops of vanilla ice cream."

lemon balm or thyme, or a little grated lemon zest","Place the whole lemon into a large deep saucepan, cover with cold water and a small heatproof plate (to keep the lemon submerged). Place the pan on a medium heat, bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes, or until the lemon is soft. (You might need to top up with more water, if the water evaporates too much.), Drain the lemon and set aside to cool completely, then cut it into quarters removing any pips. Place the lemon quarters into a blender or food processor, then blitz with the extra virgin olive oil until smooth., Preheat the oven to 160°C/325°F/gas 3. Grease and line a deep 20cm cake tin (or 12 x 10cm cake tins)., Whisk the eggs and sugar together in a large bowl, then whisk in the lemon and oil purée, the ground almonds and polenta. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin(s), spread out evenly with a palette knife and bake for 40 to 45 minutes (20 minutes if you’re making individual cakes), or until risen and golden and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin, then turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely., Meanwhile, make the lemon syrup: place the honey in a small pan on a medium-low heat and squeeze in the lemon juice. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, for 4 to 5 minutes, until the honey has melted. (You may need to add a splash of hot water if it looks too thick.) Remove from the heat and set aside to cool., To make the mascarpone cream, beat the mascarpone, icing sugar and vanilla paste together, then gently fold in the yoghurt and set aside., Tip the almonds into a small, dry frying pan and toast until golden. (Keep an eye on them!), To assemble the cake, place the sponge in the middle of the plate. Spoon the mascarpone cream on top making peaks and waves, then drizzle over the syrup and garnish with the toasted almonds and a few lemon balm leaves, if you like."

For me, the easiest way to do it without getting the scales out is to scrunch and squash the mixture into a rough 75cm sausage, simply cut it in half and into quarters, then divide each piece into 6., One by one, pat and push the portions really firmly into the cutter, pushing down in the centre and squashing the mixture up the sides with your fingers. As you push it down, remove the cutter to give you a nice round flapjack snack., Place the snacks in an airtight container, where they’ll keep happily for up to 2 weeks. Bag up and freeze any you don’t need for a later date. If any get bashed or break up, use them as a great breakfast sprinkle."

Roughly chop 40g of mixed nuts and seeds add to the frying pan along with 50g of oats. Toast for a few minutes, or until golden and fragrant., Tip the oats, nuts and seeds into a bowl, drizzle over 1 tablespoon of runny honey, then mix to coat.

Place the ice lollies in the freezer for at least 4 hours, or until solid., To make the coating, snap the chocolate into a heatproof bowl, add the olive oil, and place over a pan of gently simmering water until smooth and melted, stirring occasionally (or melt in the microwave). Take off the heat and leave for 10 minutes to cool., Line a tray that fits your freezer with a sheet of baking paper. To remove the lollies, dip the moulds in hot water for a few seconds, then carefully remove., Drizzle each lolly with the melted chocolate, sprinkle with a little Granola Dust, then lay them on the lined tray. (Work fast, you don't want them to melt!), Enjoy straight away or return the lollies to the freezer for 20 minutes to get a lovely chocolate snap!"

Line a 35x40cm baking tray with greaseproof paper, then arrange the strawberries in six evenly spaced rows across the tray. Place the tray in a cold oven and heat it to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Once the oven comes up to temperature (my oven takes about 15 minutes, but keep an eye on it), remove the tray of strawberries – you want them to be slightly dehydrated, but still vibrant and red., Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl, add the sugar and vanilla extract, then beat for at least 5 minutes, or until pale and tripled in volume., Finely grate over the lemon zest, then sift and fold in the flour until smooth. Pour the mixture over the baked strawberries and smooth it out evenly. Tap the tray on your worktop a couple of times to remove any air bubbles, then bake in the oven for 15 minutes, or until lightly golden., Remove the sponge from the oven and confidently turn it out onto another tray lined with greaseproof paper. Carefully peel off the original greaseproof paper to reveal the striped strawberry pattern., Place another sheet of greaseproof paper on your work-surface and scatter over 1 tablespoon of caster sugar. Flip the sponge back onto it so the strawberries are face-down., Using the greaseproof paper to help you, tightly roll up the sponge and leave it to cool completely., Hull and finely chop the remaining strawberries, reserving a few for decoration, and place in a bowl with the jam and elderflower cordial. Give everything a good mix and leave to macerate., Halve the vanilla pod and scrape out the seeds into a clean mixing bowl. Add the cream and icing sugar, then whisk to soft peaks. Transfer to a large piping bag with a star nozzle., Blitz the freeze-dried strawberries in a food processor to a super-fine dust., Carefully unroll the cooled sponge and spread all over with the macerated strawberries and elderflower mixture. Pipe over most of the cream (reserving a little for decoration), then gently roll the sponge back up. Trim the ends to neaten, and transfer to a serving board., Decorate the roulade with the remaining cream, strawberries and mint leaves, then sprinkle over the strawberry dust. Delicious!"

If you’re making this for a dinner party and want to work ahead a bit, just bake the pastry a few hours before, whip the cream mixture together and keep it covered in the fridge. Then, when you’re ready to serve it, add the fruit and meringues. That way, the meringues will still be crunchy and create an exciting contrast with the soft cream and berries. ”",399,27.6g,16.8g,17.2g,0.1g,4.2g,35.9g,2.6g,"1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    orange, 3                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                vanilla sugar, 400                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                double cream, 600                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                mixed seasonal berries                                                                                                                                                                ,  such as blackberries, loganberries, blueberries, red and white currants, good gooseberries, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    meringue nests, PASTRY, 250                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                plain flour                                                                                                                                                                , plus extra for dusting, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                icing sugar                                                                                                                                                                , plus extra for dusting, 125                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter                                                                                                                                                                , (cold), 1                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range egg, 1                                                                                                                                                                splash of                                                                                                                                                                milk, olive oil                                                                                                                                                                , for greasing","You can make the pastry by hand, or in a food processor. If making it by hand, sieve the flour and icing sugar into a large mixing bowl from a height., Chop the butter into small cubes, then gently work the it into the flour and sugar with your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs., Beat the egg and add to the mix with the milk and gently work it together using your hands until you have a ball. Don’t work the pastry too much or it will become elastic and chewy, not crumbly and short., Sprinkle some flour over the dough and a clean work surface, and pat the ball into a thick flat round. Sprinkle over a little more flour, then wrap the pastry in clingfilm and pop it into the fridge to rest for 30 minutes., Lightly oil the inside of a 25cm non-stick loose-bottomed tart tin., Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour, then carefully roll out the pastry, turning it every so often, until you've got a circle about 0.5cm thick., Roll the pastry over the rolling pin, then unroll it into the tin, making sure you push it into all the sides., Trim off any extra pastry, and use it to patch any holes, then prick the base of the case all over with a fork, cover with clingfilm, and pop it into the freezer for 30 minutes., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Line the pastry case with a large piece of greaseproof paper, pushing it right into the sides., Fill the pastry case right up to the top with uncooked rice, and bake blind for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Take the case out, carefully remove the rice (save it for baking blind another time) and greaseproof paper, and return the case to the oven to cook for a further 10 minutes, until it’s firm and almost biscuit-like. Leave to cool completely., Finely grate most of the orange zest into a bowl and whisk with 2 tablespoons of vanilla sugar and the cream until you get a silky mixture that forms soft peaks., Put half the berries into another bowl and use a fork to mash them up with the remaining tablespoon of vanilla sugar. Break up the meringue nests into rough pieces., Gently fold the mushed-up berries, and the meringue pieces, into the cream., Tip the cream mixture into the cooled tart case and gently shake it to help spread it out to the edges. Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread it out evenly, then sprinkle the remaining berries all over the top., Finely grate over the remaining orange zest and serve right away, with a dusting of icing sugar."

over a low heat and warm gently until melted, stirring occasionally., Remove from the heat, pour in the milk, then crack in the egg and whisk well., Sift the flour and cocoa powder into a large bowl and tip in the yeast. Make a well in the middle, then gradually pour in the milk mixture, stirring and bringing in the flour from the outside to form a rough dough., Knead on a flour-dusted surface for around 5 minutes, or until smooth and springy. Transfer to a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a clean damp tea towel and prove in a warm place for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until doubled in size., Chop half the chocolate into 12 equal-sized pieces and put aside, then finely chop the remaining chocolate into tiny chips. Chop any large dried fruits into smaller pieces., When the dough is ready, transfer to a clean surface and use your fist to knock out the air. Roughly stretch and flatten out the dough, sprinkle over the chocolate chips and dried fruit, then knead for a few minutes until smooth again, pushing any chocolate or fruit that escapes back into the dough., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4, and grease and line a 25cm x 35cm baking tray., Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Flatten one piece slightly, push a piece of chocolate into the centre, snapping it to fit, if needed, then fold the dough back over the chocolate to trap it inside. Shape the dough into a neat ball and place on the prepared tray. Repeat with the remaining dough, leaving a small gap between each bun., Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for around 45 minutes, or until doubled in size., Mix 2 tablespoons of flour with enough water to give you a thick batter consistency, then transfer to a piping bag. Pipe thin crosses across the top of the buns., Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden, then transfer to a cooling rack. Warm the honey a little to loosen, then gently brush over the buns to glaze., Slice open while warm to enjoy the melting middle – delicious served with a little butter and a pinch of sea salt, if you like."

Place it all in a mixing bowl with the cranberries, raisins, suet, flour, breadcrumbs and milk. Crack in the egg, finely grate in the clementine zest, squeeze in the juice and mix it all together really well., Tip the mixture into the greased bowl and cover with a single layer of greaseproof paper and a double layer of tin foil. Tie a piece of string around the bowl to secure them in place and make it watertight, then sit it in a large, deep saucepan and pour in enough water to come halfway up the sides of the bowl., Bring the water to the boil, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, and reduce to a simmer for 4 hours. Check the water regularly, and keep topping it up with boiling water, if needed., When the time’s up, lift out the bowl, remove the foil and paper, then carefully turn the pudding out on to a plate ready to serve, or leave to cool and reheat just before you need it., You can either drizzle it with golden syrup and a swig of Bourbon – gorgeous – or be a bit more flamboyant and gently heat a good few swigs of Bourbon just to warm it, then strike a match to the pan (stand back!), let it flame, and carefully pour it over your pudding., Present it to your guests and sing some Christmassy songs, then when the flame subsides drizzle with golden syrup.

Blitz the biscuits in a food processor until finely ground, then stir into the butter. Press the crumbs evenly into the tin, then leave in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up., Halve the vanilla pod lengthways, scrape the seeds into a large bowl and whisk in the cream cheese., In a separate bowl, whisk the cream to soft peaks, then fold into the cream cheese with 1 heaped teaspoon of jam. Spoon a 1cm-thick layer over the biscuit base., Add 1 heaped tablespoon of jam to the rest of the mixture, and add another layer to the cheesecake. Keep doing this, adding more jam each time – so the layers get darker as you go – until you have used a whole jar of jam, leaving a 1cm gap at the top. Place the cheesecake in the fridge for 1 hour to firm up., Meanwhile, make the jelly. Soak the gelatine in cold water for 5 minutes, then drain. Spoon the remaining ½ jar of jam in a saucepan over a low heat along with 100ml of water and 50g of berries, and gently simmer for 3 minutes., Stir in the gelatine until dissolved, then pour into a glass jug and cool for 30 minutes., Once cooled, pour the jelly over the cheesecake, carefully spreading over the surface. Let it sit in the fridge for 1 more hour, until the jelly is firm to the touch., The cheesecake will keep in the fridge for up to 3 days – serve garnished with the remaining blackcurrants and blackberries."

¼ of a teaspoon of sea salt, then pulse until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs., Finely grate the lemon zest and reserve for later, then squeeze in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, add the egg yolk and 2 tablespoons of cold water, and pulse to combine. If the mixture still looks dry, keep adding water and pulsing until the dough comes together., Divide the dough in two, shape into equal-sized discs, wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 1 hour to firm up., For the filling, peel and core the apples, cut into 1cm wedges and place in a saucepan. Sprinkle over the reserved lemon zest and squeeze in the remaining juice., Finely chop the dates, removing any pits, then stir in with the sugar and spices. Gently simmer over a medium-low heat for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the apples are almost tender. Set aside to cool., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Roll  one of the pastry discs out to 5mm thick on a clean, floured surface and use it to line a deep 20cm pie dish, pushing the pastry into the edges. Trim the edges, leaving a 2.5cm overhang around the dish. Spoon in the cooled pie filling, packing it tightly., Roll the second pastry disc out to 5mm thick, brush the edges with water and place over the pie, pressing the edges to seal. Fold in the overhang and crimp with your fingers., For the glaze, beat all the ingredients together in a small bowl, then brush all over the pie. If you have any off-cuts of pastry, you could make extra decorations for the top, sealing with extra glaze., Using a sharp knife, make incisions into the pie top to allow steam to escape during baking. Sprinkle with extra demerara sugar., Bake the pie for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and firm. Delicious served  warm, with pouring cream or lashings of custard."
