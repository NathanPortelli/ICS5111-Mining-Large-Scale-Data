Blitz until smooth, then pour back into the jar., Finely chop the chilli (if using) and place in a shallow bowl. Crack in one of the eggs, add a pinch of black pepper and whisk together with a fork., Soak the crumpet in the chilli and egg mixture for a couple of minutes, pressing it down and turning halfway., Meanwhile, make a quick salsa: Halve, destone, peel and roughly chop the avocado and quarter the tomatoes. Place everything in a small bowl, drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil and season to perfection. Add the reserved mint leaves and gently mix., Place the bacon in a dry non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat and leave to crisp up a little, turning every so often., Push the bacon to one side and finely grate the Parmesan cheese into the pan in a pile slightly larger than the diameter of your crumpet. Press the soaked crumpet topside down onto the cheese and pour over any remaining egg mixture, then cook for 2 minutes, until the Parmesan is golden and crispy., Carefully loosen the edges of the Parmesan with a spatula, then lift up the crumpet, pulling the Parmesan with it. Hold for a few seconds so it sets, then turn it back over into the pan, leaving you with a crispy crown on the top., Crack in the remaining egg alongside and cook to your liking., Transfer the crowned crumpet to a plate, top with the salsa and spoon some of the jalapeño dressing on the side with the crispy bacon. Top with the fried egg and serve."

Peel and finely slice the garlic and add to the pan with the parsley stalks, fennel seeds, paprika and cumin, then cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly., Flick over the harissa and scrunch in the tomatoes, then stir in ¼ of a tin’s worth of water, pop the lid back on and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until the potatoes and squash are soft, stirring occasionally., Remove the lid, stir in the parsley leaves and season with a pinch of sea salt, then cook until the sauce has thickened and reduced., Make 4 wells with the back of a spoon, crack in the eggs, pop the lid on and cook the eggs to your liking. Nice served with warm flatbreads and extra harissa, if you like."
Midnight pan-cooked breakfast | Jamie Oliver brunch recipes,"Crispy bacon, runny eggs & crusty bread","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/90246160.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In30 minutes,"“Me and this dish go back a long way. To the pre-shaving days of being an under-age drinker down the Wagon and Horses in Saffron Walden with a fake ID and all my village mates. Only once in a while of course. But seriously, without trying to sound like a lagered-up geezer, I think everyone’s experienced the need for food around midnight, whether the binge was small or large, otherwise why would kebab shops be so popular in Britain? Anyway, I always used to have three or four friends back to my house for munchies or to stay the night and this dish was devised so we didn’t have too much trouble making it or too much washing up to do. In actual fact, I only had to wipe the non-stick pan clean. It also makes its way from the pan to the plate quite quickly, as patience isn’t a virtue at that time of night with my mates! ”",,,,,,,,,"mushrooms, higher-welfare smoked or unsmoked bacon, ripe tomatoes, higher-welfare sausages, large free-range eggs, olive oil, crusty bread                                                                                                                                                                , preferably sourdough","First of all, get the biggest non-stick pan available, and preheat it on a high heat while you gather your ingredients. Obviously you wouldn’t be organised at this point so it’s a matter of using what you’ve got, but ideally I like to have mushrooms, bacon, tomatoes, sausages and eggs., By the time you have got these together the pan will be hot, so slice your sausages in half lengthways and pat them out flat so they cook quickly. Place in the pan at one side., On the other side of the pan, put a tiny lug of oil and place a pile of mushrooms over it which you can rip up or leave whole., Shake the pan about a bit to coat the mushrooms and season with some sea salt and black pepper. Push to one side, then lay some slices of bacon and halved tomatoes in the pan., Cook for a couple more minutes until the bacon is crisp and golden. Shake the pan and turn the bacon over. Now is the time to put a round of toast into the toaster., At this stage you should respect the rustic and authentic look and shuffle everything about so that it’s all mixed together and add 2 or 3 eggs at different ends of the pan. The whites of the eggs will dribble in and around the sausages, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms., Turn the heat down a little and continue to cook for another minute before placing the pan under the grill and finishing the eggs to your liking., Using a non-stick pan I’ve always found the removal of this dish to the plate extremely easy – it will resemble a frisbee and will slide on to your plate with no trouble at all. Doesn’t that sound appetising? But honestly, it really is a gem."

mustard, white wine vinegar","To make the muffins, place the milk in a jug, stir in the yeast and sugar, and leave for a couple of minutes until frothy., Place the flour and 2 teaspoons of fine sea salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the middle. Pour in the milk mixture and mix well to form a dough. Shape into a ball and knead with clean hands or in a freestanding mixer until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a clean damp tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size., Knock back the dough and roll out on a flour-dusted surface to about 2cm thick. Stamp out 10 level circles with an 8cm round cutter, rerolling as necessary., Carefully place the muffins onto a large tray lined with a large sheet of semolina-dusted greaseproof paper and sprinkle over a little more semolina. Cover with a tea towel and leave to prove for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in size., Heat a heavy non-stick pan or griddle over a low heat, add the muffins and cook for 6 to 7 minutes on each side or until golden – you may need to do this in batches. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly., Meanwhile, make the hollandaise. Gently melt the butter in a small pan., Whisk the egg yolks, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and the mustard in a heatproof bowl set over a shallow pan of simmering water., Slowly pour in the melted butter, whisking constantly until well combined. Whisk in a splash of vinegar, then have a taste and season to perfection. Turn the heat off and keep warm over the pan of water, stirring occasionally. Loosen with a splash of water if needed., Trim, wash and finely chop the spring onions. Peel and finely slice the garlic., Place a large frying pan on a medium-low heat with a little drizzle of olive oil, add the spring onions, garlic and spinach, then pick in the marjoram. Finely grate over some nutmeg, then add a pinch of sea salt and some freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 5 minutes or until the spinach is dark and delicious. Add lemon juice to taste and keep warm until ready to serve., Place a large, shallow pan of water on a medium heat and bring to the boil., Grease four tea cups with butter and crack an egg into each. Place the cups in the pan of water, then cover and poach for 4 to 5 minutes or until the eggs are cooked to your liking., To assemble, halve 4 warm muffins and divide the spinach and smoked salmon between each. Top with a perfectly poached egg, lightly season, then spoon a tablespoon of hollandaise over each one.  Finish with a final grating of nutmeg and a few sprigs of chervil, if you like."

Garlic aïoli,"Silky, pungent, peppery & delicious","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/78970257.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['1', 'jar']",In25 minutes,"“It’s a joy to partake in the ritual of making a good aïoli. The process has broken many a cook – not because it’s hard or complicated, but because it’s an emulsification of oil and egg yolk: add too much oil too quickly and it can easily split – this method demands focus. So why do it? Most shop-bought mayo, which would be the base, doesn’t use good oil, so here you have the power to make something lip-smackingly special. An aïoli is similar to a mayonnaise, but it’s pungent and almost spicy with the hum of raw garlic. It’s a boisterous condiment that, when made well and used in the right dish with restraint, is phenomenal. When a blob hits a hot soup, what might be too much in its raw state mingles to become something fantastic, and, when a small spoonful is rubbed across hot toast with cold roasted meats or dressed crab and a little lemon, you’ll discover a whole new level of deliciousness.

Place the tortilla on top of the omelette, then carefully flip both back into the pan so the tortilla ends up at the bottom., Pick and tear over the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh basil (15g), then generously drizzle with chilli sauce., Slice 100g of ripe tomatoes and arrange on top, scatter over 30g of rocket, then season to taste with salt and pepper., Tear off a 30cm piece of greaseproof paper and place flat on your work surface. Carefully slide the tortilla on top, then use the greaseproof paper to help roll up the wrap. Twist the ends of the paper to secure., Cut the wrap in half through the paper, when you’re ready to tuck in."

boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain and refresh under cold water, leaving it in the colander., At the same time, poach the fish in a large pan of simmering salted water on a medium heat for 10 minutes, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon. Turn the heat up under the poaching water and bring back to a good simmer., Meanwhile, peel the onions and finely slice with the red chilli (deseed if you like) and coriander stalks. Peel and finely chop the garlic and ginger. Place it all in a large frying pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and the butter, and cook for 10 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, stirring occasionally., Crush the fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar, and stir into the pan with the curry powder., Slice and add the leftover greens, along with the frozen peas, then gently fold in the rice with two spoons so it stays nice and fluffy., Flake in the poached fish, gently fold again, season to perfection with sea salt, black pepper and lemon juice, then keep on a low heat for just 3 or 4 minutes while you poach the eggs to your liking in the simmering water., Place the eggs on top of the kedgeree, scatter over the coriander leaves, and a little extra chilli, if you fancy, then tuck in. Delicious served with mango chutney, or dollops of lemon-spiked yoghurt."

Divide the meat mixture into six, and roll into balls., Place a ball on the palm of your hand, then pat and flatten until it’s big enough to wrap around the egg. Place a peeled egg in the centre and mould the meat up and around it, sealing the egg inside so you end up with a perfectly round ball., Coat it in flour, dunk it in the egg, allowing any excess to drip off, then roll in the breadcrumbs until well coated. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, then chill for 30 minutes., When you’re ready to cook, just under half fill a large sturdy pan with oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go., Carefully lower one Scotch egg into the pan – after about 8 minutes it should be golden and perfectly cooked through, so scoop it out, drain on kitchen paper and cut it in half to check your timings, then cook the rest, in small batches, adjusting the time, if needed., Delicious served with a dollop of English mustard, a wedge of Westcombe Cheddar, piccalilli, a few salady bits and bobs, and – of course – a nice, cold beer. Happy days!"

Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a small frying pan over a medium heat, then add the onion and potatoes., Turn the heat down to low and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the onions are turning golden and the potato slices are cooked through. Try not to stir it too much or the potatoes will break up – just use a fish slice to flip them over halfway through., Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl, season with a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then whisk together with a fork., When the onions and potatoes are cooked, remove the pan from the heat and carefully tip them into the eggs. Transfer the mixture back into the frying pan and place it over a low heat. Cook for around 20 minutes, or until there’s almost no runny egg on top., Use a fish slice to slightly lift and loosen the sides of the tortilla.

Half-fill the pan with water and bring to a simmer. Turn down the heat as low as it can go but still have the water simmering., Place the butter in a medium pan over a low heat, so it starts to melt but doesn’t burn. When the butter has melted, take it off the heat., Place the egg yolks in your heatproof mixing bowl, which you should then place over the pan of just-simmering water. It’s important that the saucepan is on a low heat, or the eggs will scramble., Using a balloon whisk, start to beat your eggs, then whisk in your white wine vinegar., Keep whisking, and then start adding the melted butter by slowly drizzling it in, whisking all the time, till all the butter has been incorporated. The result should be a lovely, smooth, thick sauce., Season carefully with sea salt and black pepper, and loosen if necessary with little squeezes of lemon juice. Keep tasting the sauce until the flavour is to your liking."

In a second bowl, whisk together the eggs and the milk until combined, then stir in 300ml of water., Mix the liquid into the flour until you have a smooth batter (be careful not to over-mix it) and stir in a pinch of sea salt., Melt the butter in a 26cm frying pan over a medium-low heat, then pour it into your crêpe batter and whisk to combine., Using the same pan, ladle in just enough mixture to coat the base. Cook for 1 minute, until golden, then flip it and cook for 1 minute on the other side., Transfer the crêpe to a plate, then repeat until you’ve used up all of the mixture, brushing the pan with a little extra butter if needs be – it should make around 30 crêpes in total. Set them aside to cool., Line a board with greaseproof paper. In the frying pan, fry 4 slices of pancetta over a medium heat for about 2 minutes, or until crisp, turning halfway., Drizzle on 1 tablespoon of maple syrup and fry for a few more minutes, until caramelised – transfer to the lined board. Repeat with the rest of the pancetta., Save a couple of rashers to serve, then roughly chop the rest and set aside until you’re ready to use them., Toast the pecans in a dry frying pan over a medium heat, and set aside., Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper and scatter over the pecans. Again using the same frying pan, melt the sugar over a medium-low heat for 10 minutes, or until it’s a golden caramel – don’t stir, just swirl the pan., Quickly pour the caramel over the pecans to coat, then set aside to harden., Once set, break the pecan praline into large pieces. Reserve one-third for the topping and smash the rest into coarse granules using a pestle and mortar. Set aside while you make the buttercream., Cream the butter and icing sugar in the bowl of a free-standing mixer for 5 minutes, until pale and smooth. Beat in the maple syrup and set aside., Now assemble your cake. Spread each crêpe with a thin layer of buttercream and sprinkle the praline or chopped pancetta over every other one.

salt in a food processor. Dice and add the butter and the egg yolks and process for 1 minute. Add about 4 tablespoons of cold water and pulse until the dough is combined., Transfer to a lightly floured surface and gently knead for 2 minutes, or until the dough is just combined. Flatten to a disc, wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for at least 1 hour., Remove the dough from the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured surface to about 5mm thick., Lay the pastry over a round 32cm tart tin (about 4cm deep), and carefully press into the base and sides. Trim any excess with a sharp knife, line the case with 4 layers of clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., To blind bake the pastry, fill with pastry weights, rice or beans and bake for 15 minutes. Lift out the weights using the clingfilm and bake the pastry for 5 more minutes, or until the base is dry. Remove from the oven, place the tin on an oven tray and leave to cool., Melt the butter in a large pan over a medium heat, dice and add the bacon or the lardons, then cook until softened. Drain on kitchen paper and allow to cool in a bowl., Dice and add the ham, grate in the Gruyère cheese and mix well. Spread evenly over the cooled pastry case. Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5., Whisk the crème fraîche, eggs, egg yolks, milk and nutmeg together in a bowl and season generously. Carefully pour the mixture into the pastry case., Bake the quiche in the oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the filling has set and the top is beginning to turn golden. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the tin., For the carrot and parsley salad, grate the carrots, pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, then combine with the oil and lemon juice in a bowl. Season generously., Serve the salad with slices of warm quiche. Delicious!"

Split the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds and add to the pan with the pod. Bring to a gentle simmer over a low heat., Beat together the egg yolks and sugar., Discard the vanilla pod from the cream mixture, then slowly pour it into the yolk mixture, stirring well to combine., Pour the custard into 6 x 100ml ovenproof dishes, ramekins or teacups., Place in a deep roasting tray and fill the tray with warm water to reach halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the custards have set. Remove from the oven, leave to cool, then chill until needed., When ready to serve, sprinkle each dish with a little extra sugar and use a blowtorch to caramelise it. Alternatively, place the custards under a hot grill, keeping an eye on them to ensure the sugar doesn’t burn – the crusts should be a lovely golden colour., Once coloured evenly, allow the sugar to cool until hard, then serve."

Alternatively, place the sugared cremas on a tray under a preheated gas grill for a few minutes, until the sugar turns dark brown. Allow the sugar to harden, then serve immediately."

Arrange on a serving platter., Scatter over the remaining chopped parsley and chives, snip over the cress, then halve the eggs and place on top., Sprinkle over some chilli salt and divide the anchovies between the eggs, drizzling over a little of the anchovy marinade too. Serve with the salad cream on the side – so simple, so delicious."

Pull the skin off your black pudding, then crumble it into the pan. When it starts to crisp, pop your bread in the toaster., When the pudding looks and tastes done, spoon it onto kitchen paper to drain while you poach your eggs., Stir the boiling water to create a motion that will help the egg white wrap around neatly. Don’t make a fuss, just crack in the eggs (you might want to do 3 in case you break one, as I often do). They will cook in a few minutes, depending on how you like them., Butter your toast, then smear it with a thin layer of Marmite or Vegemite.

Cook gently for 15 minutes on a medium-low heat, or until softened and lightly golden, adding splashes of water if needed, and tossing regularly., Meanwhile, beat 4 eggs with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper for 2 minutes so they’re light and fluffy., Toss 1 handful of frozen peas into the pan, then pour in the egg mixture. Use a rubber spatula to thoroughly mix it all together and begin to cook the eggs, then push it out flat, cover with a lid and leave to cook through for 5 minutes, or until set on the top and golden on the bottom., While that cooks, halve 2 large ripe tomatoes and remove the cores, deseed ½–1 chilli (to your taste), place both in a blender with half the juice from 1 lemon and blitz until smooth, then taste and season to perfection., Loosen around the edge of the omelette with the spatula, then place a large plate or board over the pan and in one bold, careful movement, flip it over onto the plate or board., Dress 2 handfuls of rocket with the remaining lemon juice, pile in the centre, and finely grate over 15g of Parmesan. Serve the omelette warm with the salsa, and a shake of Tabasco chipotle sauce is nice too."

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Once hot, tip in the ciabatta and toss well to coat in the oil., Cook gently for 5 to 10 minutes, or until crisp and golden; try to resist adding more oil – they will turn golden given a bit of time. Tip onto a plate, then wipe out the pan with kitchen paper and set aside., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, then add the broccoli and cook until just tender (about 5 minutes for purple sprouting or 3 minutes for tenderstem)., Fill a bowl with cold water, then lift the broccoli from the pan and into the cold water to cool. Keep the pan of water on the hob., Gently lower the eggs into the pan of boiling water and simmer for 
6 minutes, or until they are just soft in the middle. Drain and set aside., Tip the broccoli into a colander, then cool the eggs in a fresh bowl of cold water for a few minutes., Next, combine 1 tablespoon of oil with the mustard, vinegar and sugar, plus 1 tablespoon of cold water and a little seasoning to make the dressing. Peel, then halve the eggs., Peel and thinly slice the garlic, tear up the anchovies and trim and finely chop the chilli., Put 1 tablespoon of oil in the frying pan, place over a medium heat and fry the garlic for 30 seconds. Toss in the drained broccoli and cook for 2 minutes over a high heat, until starting to colour here and there., Spread the broccoli over a platter, then add the eggs, croutons and anchovies. Scatter with the chilli, drizzle over the dressing and serve."

the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Finely chop the spring onions, then peel and finely slice the garlic. Chop the chillies., Heat a good glug of oil in a large, ovenproof pan. Add the spring onions, garlic and bay leaves, and cook over a low heat for 10 minutes, until the spring onions are soft and sweet., Bash the cardamom pods and the coriander and cumin seeds with a pestle and mortar and add to the pan with the turmeric, chopped chilli and a couple of hearty pinches of sea salt. Stir for 3 to 4 minutes over a medium heat, until the spices are fragrant., Increase the heat, add the rice and a little more oil if needed and stir to coat in the spices. Pour over about 800ml of cold water – you want it to come about 1cm above the rice. Pop the lid on and put the pan into the oven for 25 minutes., While the rice is cooking, put the root veg on a baking tray, drizzle with oil, season and pop into the oven to warm up for the last 10 minutes., Meanwhile, poach your eggs. Put a shallow pan of water over a medium heat, add a splash of vinegar and, once simmering, break in the eggs and cook for 2 to 3 minutes., Once the veg and rice are done, remove them from the oven and stir them together. Mix through the greens, herbs and lime juice., Pile the mixture into bowls, top each one with a poached egg, and serve with the pomegranate seeds scattered on top."

Finely chop the chillies., Heat 2 tablespoons of peanut oil in a small saucepan, add the shallots and chilli and sauté over a low heat until very soft, about 10 minutes., Add the palm sugar and 20ml of water, increase the heat to high and bring it to the boil. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until caramelised.

Add the fish sauce and a the lime juice, then remove from the heat. Set aside until needed (you won’t need it all for this dish but the rest will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks)., Peel and finely slice the garlic, peel and finely grate the ginger, then halve the broccoli and Brussels lengthways., Heat 50ml of oil in a large frying pan or wok over a high heat, add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the broccoli and brussels sprouts and cook, stirring, for 8 minutes.

Stir in the fish sauce, put the lid on the pan and cook for 2 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender. Add the beansprouts and toss to combine. Divide between four serving plates., Wipe out the pan and return it to the heat, add a splash of oil and let it get nice and hot. In a bowl, whisk two eggs with a pinch of sea salt, pour them into the pan and swirl to coat it in a thin layer., Cook until the eggs are just set, then lay half of the salmon on top and roll up to enclose. Slice the rolls in half and set aside. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make another omelette roll., Arrange the pieces of omelette on top of the vegetables and serve with a little chilli sauce on the side."

Pick, tear and toss in the basil leaves (reserving the smaller ones for garnish), then leave aside to macerate for a few minutes., Meanwhile, place a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat., Drain the beans and put into the hot pan with the fennel seeds and a pinch of black pepper. Leave for 5 minutes, shaking occasionally – you want them to char and pop open, bursting their skins., Pour the macerated tomatoes into the pan with 100ml of water, season, then leave to bubble away vigorously for 1 minute., Crack in an egg on each side, then cover with a lid, plate or tin foil, reduce to a medium-low heat and slow-cook for 3 to 4 minutes for nice soft eggs, or longer if you prefer.

Add the onions, coriander stalks and jalapeño and sauté for 10 minutes, until softened but not coloured. Stir in the coriander seeds, fry for a couple more minutes, then add the lentils., Stir in 800ml boiling water and bring back to the boil. Season well, reduce the heat, pop on the lid and simmer for 40 minutes, until the lentils are cooked and beginning to break down., Blacken the peppers by either placing them directly on a gas flame, or griddling them in a griddle pan, turning regularly until blackened all over. Pop them in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and let stand., After about 5 minutes the peppers should be ready, so flake away the blistered skin and remove the stalk and seeds. Slice the flesh into thin strips and leave to one side., Place the chipotle chilli in a small bowl and pour in just enough boiling water to cover. After a few minutes, it should have softened; carefully remove from the bowl and finely chop., Place a medium-sized pan over a medium heat and pour in a lug of olive oil. Add the garlic and all the chillies and fry for 1 minute, then add the peppers and paprika. Fry for a few more minutes, then add the tomatoes., Season well and gradually bring everything to a simmer. Leave to bubble away gently for 10 minutes, until you have a thick and rich tomato sauce. Add a splash of red wine vinegar and set aside. Chop the coriander leaves, then stir through., When your lentils are cooked, roughly purée with a stick blender, then pop back over a medium heat with a lug of oil. Fry for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, so you end up with crispy fried lentils., Place a frying pan over a medium heat and add a splash of oil. Crack in the eggs, one at a time, and cook to your liking. Slice the avocados and dress with the juice of 1 lime. Cut the remaining lime into quarters., Serve the refried lentils with a dollop of the red pepper salsa, dressed avocado and topped with a fried egg and a wedge of lime."

Super eggs Benedict recipe | Jamie Oliver recipes,With homemade hollandaise sauce,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/oldImages/large/1436_1_1425380027.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In40 minutes,"“I do love eggs Benedict. Hot fluffy muffins are important, but really good wafer-thin smoked ham is essential. For fun, I’ve given you a simple method for creating a double-yolker egg, which also helps you achieve the perfect shape. There’s more hollandaise here than you need, but the reality is it’s really hard to make a smaller batch because you’re emulsifying the butter. However, you can refrigerate what you don’t need and use it almost like a mayonnaise over the next few days. Feel free to swap out the ham for beautiful smoked salmon, or even a slow-roasted portobello mushroom, if you prefer. ”",418,22.7g,8.2g,3.9g,,26.7g,30.6g,,"4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    spring onions, olive oil, 400                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                baby spinach, 1                                                                                                                                                                whole                                                                                                                                                                nutmeg                                                                                                                                                                , for grating, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    English muffins, 8                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                free-range eggs, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                wafer-thin smoked ham, Hollandaise:, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter, 2                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range egg yolks, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar","Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Trim and finely chop the spring onions and put them into a large frying pan on a medium-low heat with a little drizzle of oil., Add the spinach with a grating of nutmeg and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Cook down until dark and delicious, and any excess water has cooked away, then add a squeeze of lemon juice to taste, and keep warm., To make the hollandaise, melt the butter in a small pan. Put the egg yolks into a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water and whisk with a tablespoon of lemon juice and the mustard., Whisking constantly, very slowly (otherwise it will split) pour the melted butter into the egg mixture, until well combined, adding a splash of water to loosen, if needed. Whisk in a splash of vinegar and season to perfection., Turn the heat off and keep warm over the pan of water, stirring occasionally, and loosening with an extra splash of water if needed (or see tip)., Warm the muffins in the oven., Meanwhile, simply press an oiled sheet of good-quality clingfilm into an oiled teacup, then crack 2 eggs into it to cheat a double-yolker. Bring the sides up, ease out any air, twist together and tie a tight knot to pouch the egg into a parcel – it’s very easy., Repeat with the remaining eggs (a drizzle of truffle oil, a shake of Tabasco or a few fresh soft herbs can be added to your parcels for extra flavour)., Poach the parcels in a pan of gently simmering water for 8½ minutes. To check they’re done, lift one out with a slotted spoon and gently squeeze – use your instincts., Halve the warm muffins, then divide over the spinach and waves of delicate ham.

Prick each of your chillies and the pepper (if you're only using 4 chillies, you'll need the pepper to bulk up the filling) with a small, sharp knife, then blacken over a gas flame, in a dry griddle pan or under a grill. Once they’re nicely charred, pop them in a bowl and cover with clingfilm., After 10 minutes, remove the skin, stalks and seeds, then delicately tear lengthways into thin strips. Put these strips back in the bowl and add the red wine vinegar and a lug of olive oil. Pick the parsley leaves and finely chop the stalks. Stir the stalks into the bowl, reserving the leaves for later., Peel and finely chop the garlic. Heat a lug of olive oil and some butter in a small ovenproof frying pan, then add half of your marinated chillies and the garlic., Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl with some grated Parmesan and a good pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Put a few of your parsley leaves to one side, then finely chop the rest and add them to the eggs., Pour the eggs into the pan, then crumble in half of the goat’s cheese or feta. Move the pan a bit to spread everything around., When the egg is just starting to set, crumble over most of the remaining goat’s cheese, then pop the frittata in a hot oven for 5 minutes or until it doubles in size., Some people cook their frittatas all the way through, but I prefer mine only just done. Once it’s out of the oven, delicately drape the rest of your chilli over the top, crumble over the last few bits of goat’s cheese or feta, then drizzle over a little of the chilli marinade. Sprinkle with the reserved parsley and serve with something fresh and lovely, like a rocket, lemon and Parmesan salad."

Grease a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin with a little butter, then set side., Sieve the flour into a large bowl, then rub in the butter with the tips of your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add 6 tablespoons of cold water, stirring with a knife until it forms a rough dough. Use your hands to bring it together into a ball, then wrap in cling film and pop in the fridge for around 30 minutes to rest., Meanwhile, make the filling. Finely slice the bacon, garlic and leeks. Add the bacon and garlic to a large pan with a splash of olive oil over a medium heat. Pick in the thyme leaves and cook for around 2 minutes, or until lightly golden, stirring occasionally. Stir in the leeks, turn the heat down to medium–low and cover. Cook for a further 20 minutes, or until softened, adding the spinach for the final minute to wilt. Tip the veg and bacon mixture into a large jug. Grate and add the Cheddar, then add the eggs, crème fraîche and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir well, then set aside., On a flour-dusted surface, roll out the dough to roughly ½cm thick. Carefully place into the tart tin and push it into the sides (don’t worry if it breaks – patch up any holes with spare pastry). Trim and discard the excess. Place a double layer of clingfilm on top and fill the tin with baking beans or uncooked rice. Place the tin on a baking tray, then pop in the hot oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove the beans and clingfilm, then return to the oven for a further 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden., Pour the filling into the baked pastry case, then return to the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the filling is almost set. Leave to cool slightly, then carefully remove the tart tin and serve alongside a crisp, green salad."

Ideally in a food processor, or using a box grater and good knife skills, grate the onion and carrot, then finely slice the cabbage. Very finely slice the chilli by hand, then tip everything into a large bowl., Add most of the coriander leaves, then pour over the avocado dressing and toss together well. Taste and season to perfection again, if needed., Whisk all the eggs together in a bowl, with a splash of water to loosen and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat. Once fairly hot, put in a tiny drizzle of oil followed by a quarter of the egg mixture., Swirl it all around the pan, grate over a quarter of the cheese and let it melt, then cook the omelette gently without colouring it, so it’s soft, silky and smooth, for just under 2 minutes, only cooking on one side., Slide it on to a plate, spoon over a quarter of the avocado slaw, then gently fold up the sides and roll over. Serve with a wedge of lime and a few extra coriander leaves., Repeat with the remaining ingredients, serving them up as you go."

Crack in the egg and whisk well to a smooth batter. Carefully slice the corn kernels off the cob, then stir into the batter. Crumble in the feta and give it a final stir., Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat, then add the bacon and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until crisp, turning halfway. Meanwhile, halve and destone the avocado. Slice each half into four wedges and peel away the skin. Season with salt and pepper, grate over a little lime zest and squeeze some lime juice on top., Transfer the bacon to a plate, then return the pan to a medium heat. Once hot, use a ladle to spoon the batter into the pan – each ladleful will make 1 pancake, so you can make about 2 at a time. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until little bubbles start to show on the top, then use a fish slice to flip them over and cook for a further 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden., Divide the pancakes between 4 plates, top each with 2 pieces of avocado and 2 rashers of bacon. Drizzle over a little yoghurt and chilli sauce, grate over a little more lime zest and pick a few coriander leaves on top, then tuck in."

Sift in the flour, baking powder and ¼ teaspoon of salt, then whisk until fully combined. Add the cooled melted butter and gradually stir it through the mixture. It’s important not to stir the mixture any more after this or your waffles may be tough., Place your griddle pan over a high heat, add the extra teaspoon of butter and as soon as it’s melted pour in the waffle batter and spread it around to fill the pan. You could also make smaller waffles, if you prefer – you’ll need to do 2 at a time., Lower the heat to medium-low and cook the waffles for around 6 minutes, or until lightly golden on the bottom. Flip over and continue to cook for around 6 minutes, until golden and cooked through. (It can be tricky to flip a whole waffle, but be bold and go for it – if it breaks, don’t worry, you can rock the rustic look.), Give the waffle an extra couple of minutes on each side to crisp up, then serve them with your toppings. I like mine with bacon, egg and maple syrup, but you can serve them with berries and yoghurt, or whatever you like."

Mix again., Beat the egg with the milk, then add the mixture and gently work it together until it forms a ball of dough. Remember not to work the pastry too much at this stage or it will become elastic and chewy, not crumbly and short., Sprinkle a little flour over the dough, pat into a flat round about 2.5cm thick, then srinkle over a little more flour, and wrap the dough in clingfilm. Pop it into the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes., Get yourself a 25cm non-stick loose-bottomed tart tin and, using a splash of vegetable oil on a piece of kitchen paper, lightly oil the inside., Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour, then carefully roll out your pastry, turning it every so often, until it’s about ½cm thick., Carefully roll your pastry around the rolling pin, then unroll it carefully over your oiled tin. Ease the pastry into the tin, making sure you push it into all the sides., Trim off any excess by running a knife along the top of the pastry case, then prick the base of the case all over with a fork and pop it into the freezer for 30 minutes., Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Get yourself a large square piece of greaseproof paper, scrunch it up, then unwrap it and use it to line your pastry case, pushing it right into the sides. Fill the case right up to the top with rice, and bake blind for 10 minutes in your preheated oven., Take the case out, carefully remove the rice and greaseproof paper (you can save the rice to use for blind baking another time), then return the case to the oven to cook for a further 10 minutes until it’s firm and almost biscuit-like. Leave to cool."

Deseed and finely slice the peppers and chillies., Get a large frying pan (make sure you’ve got a lid to go with it) on a high heat and add several good lugs of olive oil., Add the onion, garlic, peppers, fresh and dried chillies, bay leaves and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and cook for 15 minutes, or until to softened and caramelised, stirring regularly., Pour in the tomatoes, using a spoon or potato masher to break them up. Bring to the boil, then turn down to a medium heat and cook for a further 5 minutes to reduce the sauce., When you’ve got a nice thick tomato stew consistency, have a taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed., Slice the fresh tomatoes and lay them over the top of the mixture., Use a spoon to make small wells in the tomato stew, then crack in the eggs so they poach in the thick, delicious juices – try to crack them in as quickly as you can so they all get to cook for roughly the same amount of time., Season from a height, put the lid on and let the eggs cook for around 3 to 4 minutes, or until cooked to your liking., Warm the tortillas while this is happening. You can pop them into the oven at 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for a few minutes, microwave them for a few seconds or even lay them over the lid of the pan so they heat up as the eggs cook., Take the lid off and check your eggs by giving them a poke with your finger. When they’re done to your liking, turn the heat off and take the pan to the table with the warmed tortillas, the Cheddar and a grater so everyone can get involved and make their own. Personally, I like to grate a bit of cheese right on to a warm tortilla, spoon an egg and some of the wonderful tomato stew on top, wrap it up, and eat it right away. What a beautiful way to wake up!"

Louisiana bayous have a sort of wild, swampy charm about them that I love. Wild pecan trees grow along the banks, so there’s no shortage of this delicious nut. Another ingredient. Louisiana has in abundance is molasses, thanks to the fields and fields of sugar cane. I’ve used both these ingredients to make this beautiful, and quintessentially Southern, dessert. Molasses can be found in health food shops and all good supermarkets – it’s worth getting your hands on some if you can., Start by making the pastry, adding the optional vanilla seeds and orange zest from the list of ingredients., Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Take half your pecans and put them inside a clean tea towel or in a sandwich bag. Use a rolling pin to bash them up finely., After the pastry has had 30 minutes in the fridge, continue through the method of the sweet pastry recipe until baked blind., To make the filling, use a whisk to mix the eggs, sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. Add your finely bashed pecans and mix again with a spoon until completely blended and smooth. Add the molasses, melted butter and bourbon, mix well, then fold in your reserved whole pecans. Pour this mixture into the pastry case., Put the tart into the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the filling starts setting at the sides., Remove and leave to cool in its tin for an hour (if you can wait that long), to really help it set, before serving. I think a slice of slightly warm pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream is absolute heaven."

Poached Egg & Smoked Salmon | Eggs Recipes | Jamie Oliver Recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/oldImages/large/952_1_1439206036.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",,"“Believe it or not, for many years poached eggs were just getting me every time. They were busting, or just generally not great ... It was really only once I started looking after chickens that I started to get the hang of making them. I think even as a chef I’d been taught to create a vortex in the water then pop the egg into the middle, but if you’re cooking for lots of people, that’s a pain. So this new way guarantees a perfectly poached pouch of egg every time. The exciting thing is that by simply tying the egg up in cling film with a few herbs you can flavour the eggs and have confidence they’re going to cook all right. ”",290,20g,7g,2g,1.3g,26g,2g,2.1g,"2                                                                                                                                                                knobs of                                                                                                                                                                butter, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemons, olive oil, dried chilli flakes, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    head of celery                                                                                                                                                                , plus inner yellow leaves, a few                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh tarragon, 4                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range eggs, 500                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                asparagus                                                                                                                                                                , woody ends snapped off, 8                                                                                                                                                                slices of                                                                                                                                                                smoked salmon (roughly 240g)","Half-fill a medium-large saucepan with water, season generously with salt and bring to the boil. Instead of putting a lid on, put a large bowl on top but don’t let it touch the water. Put the butter, a pinch of salt and pepper and the juice of 1 lemon into the bowl., This is going to sound cheffy, but it’s simple, so bear with me ... Tear off 8 sheets of good- quality cling film, each roughly 40cm square. Get yourself 4 teacups or small bowls and rub the rims with olive oil. Place a double layer of cling film on top of each one and carefully push it in so that it snugly lines the cups. Use your finger to lightly oil the inside – this will help your egg come out easily at the end. Put a tiny pinch of salt, pepper and chilli flakes into each cup then pick the celery and tarragon leaves and divide them between the cups too – try to help these flavours to spread up the sides, if you can., Carefully crack the egg into the cling film, then gently push the yolk down so the egg white surrounds it (without it breaking). Bring the cling film up into a bundle, then tie it in a knot and try to squeeze the knot down so it creates a perfect pouch and seals it (imagine a goldfish in a fairground plastic bag)., Once the water is boiling, remove the bowl (the butter should be melted now) and place your eggs in the water along with the asparagus. It takes between 5 and 6 minutes at a gentle simmer for a large egg. Place the bowl or a lid back on top and after 3 or 4 minutes remove the asparagus to the bowl of lemony butter and quickly toss., Meanwhile, arrange 2 pieces of smoked salmon on each plate. Pull out one of your eggs after 5 minutes and have a little feel (it should have a similar texture to fresh mozzarella). If it still seems undercooked, pop it back in for another minute or so., Neatly divide the asparagus between your plates. Cut off the cling film knots with a pair of scissors, peel away the rest, then carefully lift the eggs with a tablespoon and serve them right on top of your asparagus. If you‘ve done a good job, not only will you have perfect poached eggs, but the herbs and seasonings will have cooked into the egg and become one, like a stained glass window, which is really cute. Poke a knife into the egg to let the yolk run, and serve with wedges of lemon on the side."

quinoa according to the packet instructions, with a good pinch of sea salt., Meanwhile, trim and finely slice all the chillies, slice the tomato, quarter the cherry tomatoes and trim and finely slice the spring onions., Heat a good lug of olive oil in a frying pan over a high heat, add the cumin seeds and fry for around 30 seconds., Drain and add the beans, followed by a pinch of salt and continue cooking for 5 to 8 minutes, or until crisp all over., While the beans are cooking, place the sliced chillies into a bowl with the vinegar, sugar and a pinch of salt, then put aside., Drain the quinoa well, then drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice and season lightly. Spread it out on a tray and leave aside to cool slightly., Transfer the cooked beans to a bowl, wipe the pan clean and return to a medium heat with a splash of olive oil. Once hot, crack in the eggs and fry to your liking – for lovely, runny eggs, you only need a couple of minutes., Transfer the quinoa to a large serving platter, layer the eggs on top and spoon over the crispy beans., Halve and destone the avocado, then scoop out and dot over the flesh. Scatter the tomatoes, spring onions and chillies on top, then drizzle over a little of the pickling juice., Pick and roughly chop the mint and coriander leaves and sprinkle on top, then add a drizzle of extra virgin olive and serve with plenty of hot chilli sauce."

Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Whisk together and put to one side., Add the peas, broad beans and a good pinch of salt to a pestle and mortar, then pick in the mint leaves and bash to a rough paste., Stir in the zest and juice of ½ a lemon, a good grating of Parmesan, 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of pepper (you may need to do this in batches). Have a taste and add a little extra Parmesan or lemon juice, if needed., Place a small non-stick ovenproof frying pan (roughly 20cm) on a low heat. Slice the asparagus in half at an angle, then add to the pan with a lug of olive oil and fry gently for a minute or so. Meanwhile, fold half the pisto through the egg to combine., Pour the egg mixture into the pan over the asparagus, then spoon little bombs of the remaining pisto on top. Stir gently for a minute or so, then scatter over the feta and grate a little more Parmesan on top, if you like it extra cheesy., Place the pan in the hot oven for about 5 minutes, or until golden and risen., Meanwhile, roughly chop the tomatoes and add to a bowl with the pea shoots, a small handful of peas and the rocket. Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil, add a squeeze of lemon juice and toss to coat. Season lightly with salt and pepper and crumble over the feta, if using., When the frittata is ready, turn it out onto a board and serve with the salad."

Gradually add about half the oil, very slowly at first, whisking continuously for around 3 to 5 minutes, or until thickened. Once you’ve added about half the oil, whisk in 1 tablespoon of vinegar – this will loosen the mixture slightly and give it a paler colour. Continue to gradually add the remaining oil, whisking continuously. Season with a pinch of salt, a squeeze of lemon juice and a little more vinegar, if needed.

Boil for 3 to 4 minutes, then transfer to a bowl of cold water. Once cooled, carefully peel them., Squeeze the sausages out of their skins and into a bowl., Pick and finely chop the herb leaves, add to the sausage meat along with a good grating of nutmeg, the mustard and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Give it all a good mix together then divide into 8 balls., Have 3 plates ready - one with a small handful of flour, one with the two remaining eggs (beat them together first), and a third with the breadcrumbs., Start by flouring your hands, then in the palm of one hand, flatten one of the sausage balls into an oval-shaped pattie., Roll a peeled egg in flour, then pop it in the middle of the patty Gently shape the meat evenly around the egg, moulding it with your hands until sealed., Roll the meat-wrapped egg in the flour, shake off any excess, then dip into the beaten egg, followed by the breadcrumbs. Roll in the egg and breadcrumbs again for a really good coating., Heat the oil in a deep pan or deep fat fryer to about 150ºC/300ºF. If you have a cooking thermometer it’s a good idea to use it. Otherwise, test if the oil is hot enough by adding a piece of raw potato and leaving it for about 1 minute – if it sizzles and browns, it’s ready., Carefully lower the eggs into the pan and cook for 4 minutes, or until golden, turning them every so often. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper (if you’re worried about the meat being under-cooked, deep-fry the scotch eggs until they’re golden and crispy, then pop them in a hot oven for a couple of minutes.), Cool the Scotch eggs slightly, then arrange on board with a good piece of Scottish Cheddar, some pickle and a few pickled onions.

Eat these while they are hot, crispy and still oozy in the middle, or if you want to go down the picnic route, just boil the eggs for an extra minute. ”",221,14.9g,3.5g,0.4g,0.67g,9.7g,13g,0.6g,"4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    higher-welfare Cumberland sausages                                                                                                                                                                , (about 300g), ½                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                sweet paprika, 1                                                                                                                                                                sprig of                                                                                                                                                                fresh rosemary, 1                                                                                                                                                                sprig of                                                                                                                                                                fresh sage, 1                                                                                                                                                                whole                                                                                                                                                                nutmeg                                                                                                                                                                , for grating, 3                                                                                                                                                                handfuls of                                                                                                                                                                plain flour, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    large free-range eggs, 125                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                white breadcrumbs, 12                                                                                                                                                                                                                    free-range quail's eggs, vegetable oil                                                                                                                                                                , (about 2 litres), 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    new potato                                                                                                                                                                , for testing","Put the kettle on to boil. Pick and very finely chop the rosemary and sage leaves., Tear open the sausages and squeeze the meat on to a plate. Season with the paprika, the chopped herbs, a few gratings of nutmeg and a little sea salt and black pepper, then use a fork to mash it all up., Beat the eggs in a bowl. Put the flour and breadcrumbs into 2 separate bowls, so you have 3 bowls in total., Carefully put the quail’s eggs into a small pan. Once the kettle boils, pour in the boiling water straight away and cook for 2 minutes, no longer. Move the pan to the sink and run cold water over the eggs for 2 to 3 minutes. Tap, roll and – ever so gently – peel the shells off them. Do it under running water if it helps. You’ll get quicker at peeling them as you go., Take a marble-sized piece of sausage meat and flatten it out in the palm of your clean hand until it’s about 6cm in diameter. Pop an egg into the middle, then carefully shape and mould the sausage meat up around the egg with your floured hands. You need to get into the routine of pulling up the sides, gently squeezing, moulding, patting and very gently squashing the meat around the egg., Repeat with all 12 eggs, then coat them well with flour. Transfer them to the bowl of beaten egg and coat well, then roll them in the breadcrumbs. They’ll be more robust to hold now, so pat and hug them into shape. When they’re all done, put them into a container and pop them into the fridge until needed., When you’re ready to cook, put a deep casserole-type pan on a medium-high heat and fill it about 8cm deep with vegetable oil. Make sure you never fill a pan more than halfway up. Add a piece of potato to help you gauge the temperature – it’s ready once the potato turns golden and floats (or when the oil reaches 180°C on a thermometer)., Carefully lower one wee Scotch egg into the pan. After about 4 minutes it should be golden and perfectly cooked through, so take it out of the pan and cut it in half to see if you should have cooked it for less or more time – once you know where you stand, you can cook the rest, in batches of 6 or less., Transfer the cooked Scotch eggs to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain, and serve scattered with a pinch of salt, alongside a pot of English mustard and a cold beer."

As the oil gets hotter you’ll see it start to change the color of the eggs. If the oil starts to spit it’s because it’s too hot, so turn the heat right down. Cook until the tops of the whites are set but the yolk is still runny., When they’re ready, remove the pan from the heat and take the eggs out using a spatula. Place on a plate and dab them with some paper towels to soak up any excess oil. Serve on toast – no need to butter it – with a sprinkling of the sea salt and freshly ground black pepper., Delicious served on some 7-grain bread."

Stir the eggs continuously with something flexible like a spatula to get right into the corners, and cook until little pieces of cooked egg are surrounded by soft, smooth and still quite runny egg. The egg will continue to cook even when the heat is turned off, so undercook them slightly and leave them in the pan while you butter your toast., Season the eggs with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste and pour over the toast., Quarter the lemon, then drape the salmon over the eggs and serve it with the lemon wedges. Add plenty of black pepper and serve immediately."

It’s Spanish because of the chorizo and potato, but a little Italian too because I like to finish it off in the oven instead of on the hob, so it puffs up like a soufflé. It has all the things I love in it – potatoes, sausage and eggs., Preheat your oven to full whack, or get your grill nice and hot. Put the potatoes into a saucepan of boiling salted water and simmer them until cooked, then drain in a colander and leave them to steam dry. Beat the eggs with a fork in a large mixing bowl, season well with salt and pepper, and put to one side., Heat a 20cm non-stick, ovenproof frying pan. Add the chorizo slices and the potato chunks. The chorizo will start to sizzle, releasing all its tasty oils and spices. After a couple of minutes, when everything’s lightly golden and crisp, remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and put to one side. Sprinkle the rosemary leaves into the hot fat. As soon as they hit the pan, they’ll start to crisp up. Pour the beaten eggs on top immediately, adding the potatoes and chorizo and spreading everything out evenly. Place the whole pan in the preheated oven or under the grill until the omelette is golden brown on top and just cooked through in the middle., While the omelette is cooking, put the shallots into a bowl with the lemon juice, some salt and pepper and a lug of extra virgin olive oil. Toss and pinch the shallots with your fingertips to soften them slightly, then mix in the parsley leaves. Serve a little on top of the omelette and tuck in!"

Repeat with the rest of the eggs. You’ll see them begin to cook immediately – don’t worry if the edges look a little scruffy. Depending on the pan, a really soft poached egg should take around 2 minutes and a soft to firm one will need 4 minutes (it depends on the size of the eggs and whether you’re using them straight from the fridge)., To check whether they’re done, remove one carefully from the pan with a slotted spoon and give it a gentle push with a teaspoon. If it feels too soft (use your instincts), put it back and give the eggs a minute or two more in the water to firm up., When they’re ready, remove them to some kitchen paper to dry off and serve with buttered toast and a sprinkle of sea salt and black pepper."

Continue frying until both sides are golden., You can make these pancakes large or small, depending on what you prefer. Serve them with a drizzle of maple syrup, or even with some butter or crème fraîche. If you choose to sprinkle with a flavouring, try one of these... fresh corn from the cob, crispy bacon or pancetta, blueberries, banana, stewed apple, grated chocolate – anything else you can imagine..."

Beat well with a fork., Heat a small knob of butter in a small frying pan on a low heat, and once melted and bubbling, add the eggs and move the pan around to spread them out evenly., When the omelette begins to cook and firm up, but still has a little raw egg on top, sprinkle over the cheese (if using). I sometimes grate mine directly on to the omelette., Using a spatula, ease around the edges of the omelette, then fold it over in half. When it starts to turn golden brown underneath, remove the pan from the heat and slide the omelette on to a plate., For a tomato and basil omelette, pick and roughly tear the basil leaves. Chop the tomatoes in half, then add to a hot frying pan with a small knob of butter, a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Fry and toss around for 1 minute, then turn the heat down to medium and sprinkle over the basil leaves. Add the eggs and move the pan around to spread them out evenly. Continue as for the basic omelette., For a mushroom omelette, quarter or roughly chop the mushrooms and add to a hot frying pan with a small knob of butter, a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Fry and toss around until golden, then turn the heat down to medium. Add the eggs and move the pan around to spread them out evenly. When the omelette begins to cook and firm up, but still has a little raw egg on top, sprinkle over the Cheddar. Continue as for the basic omelette."

Even if you’ve never made pastry before, as long as you stick to the correct measurements for the ingredients and you follow the method exactly, you’ll be laughing. The one place where you can experiment is with flavouring. If you don’t fancy using lemon zest, try another dry ingredient like orange zest instead. Or a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg or cocoa powder. Vanilla seeds are great too. Just remember to be subtle and don’t go overboard with any of these flavours!, Try to be confident and bring the pastry together as quickly as you can – don’t knead it too much or the heat from your hands will melt the butter. A good tip is to hold your hands under cold running water beforehand to make them as cold as possible. That way you’ll end up with a delicate, flaky pastry every time., Sieve the flour from a height on to a clean work surface and sieve the icing sugar over the top. Using your hands, work the cubes of butter into the flour and sugar by rubbing your thumbs against your fingers until you end up with a fine, crumbly mixture. This is the point where you can spike the mixture with interesting flavours, so mix in your lemon zest., Add the eggs and milk to the mixture and gently work it together till you have a ball of dough. Flour it lightly. Don’t work the pastry too much at this stage or it will become elastic and chewy, not crumbly and short. Flour your work surface and place the dough on top. Pat it into a flat round, flour it lightly, wrap it in clingfilm and put it into the fridge to rest for at least half an hour."

Score the vanilla pods lengthways and scrape out the vanilla seeds with a knife or a teaspoon. Place the seeds into a saucepan, add the pods, all the cream and milk and slowly bring to the boil. Remove from the heat., Meanwhile, get yourself a large bowl that will fit over your pan and beat together the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Remove the vanilla pods from the pan and, little by little, add the milk and cream to the egg mixture in the bowl, whisking continuously. Add 2.5cm of hot water to your dirty pan, bring to a simmer and put the bowl on top of the pan. Cook the mixture for 5 minutes over the simmering water, stirring often, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Stir in a small handful of lavender flowers, but the trick is to be delicate – you only need a hint of its distinctive, strong flavour., Remove any bubbles or froth from the mixture before dividing it between your ramekins. Stand these in a high-sided roasting tray, and fill the tray with water halfway up the ramekins. Place carefully in the preheated oven and cook for around 30 to 45 minutes or until the mixture has set but is still slightly wobbly in the centre. Allow to cool at room temperature then place in the fridge until ready., To serve, sprinkle each crème brûlée with a tablespoon of caster sugar and some more of the lavender flowers and caramelize under a very hot grill or using the chef’s torch."

Turn the chipolatas over, add the mushrooms to the tray, face up, drizzle with a little oil and season with sea salt and black pepper., Lay the bacon in and around everything and pop the tray back under the grill for another 7 to 8 minutes, or until the chipolatas are cooked through., When the tray of extras is just about perfect, turn the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and pop them down at the bottom of the oven to keep warm,, Give the bubble and squeak one final pat down and use the back of a spoon to make four dents, evenly spaced around the pan. Crack in the eggs – it looks fantastic, isn’t predictable and saves on washing up., Season with a tiny bit of salt and pepper and put in the oven for about 8 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking., To serve, pop the tray of bubble & squeak and eggs in the middle of the table with the tray of extras on the side."

Drain and leave to steam dry., Cut the chorizo into 2cm chunks and place in a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan. Cook in the hot oven for a couple of minutes to render out the fat and give it a bit of colour. Carefully pull out the pan, give it a jiggle and add the sliced pepper. Return to the oven for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the pepper starts to soften. Add the potatoes and tomatoes to the pan and give it a good shake so that everything gets coated in all the lovely chorizo oil. Return to the oven for 2 to 3 minutes, or until everything is cooked through and nicely coloured., Remove the pan from the oven and use the back of a spoon to make four wells in the mixture. Crack your eggs, one by one, into the wells. Season with salt and pepper, then return the pan to the oven for about 2 minutes (depending on how you like your eggs). Keep a close eye on the pan and pull it out as soon as the eggs are done to your liking. Scatter with chopped parsley, then take the pan to the table for everyone to tuck in. Serve with hunks of crusty bread."

Place the egg yolk and mustard in a bowl and whisk together, then start to add your oils bit by bit. Once you’ve blended in a quarter of the oil, you can start to add the rest in larger amounts.  When the mixture thickens, add lemon juice. When all the oil has gone in, add the garlic and any extra flavours (see above). To finish off, season to taste with salt, pepper and a bit more lemon juice, if needed., Try this: Lemon -or basil- flavoured aioli is good with salads, all types of fish, and in seafood soups. It's also great with roasted fish, chicken or pork, and is a classic with salmon."
