Cook for 8 minutes, or until the sausage has crisped up., Remove the lid and coarsely grate over half the cheese, then use a fish slice to confidently flip the bagel., Grate the remaining cheese onto the sausage, pop the lid back on the pan and cook covered on a low heat for 4 more minutes, or until the cheese has melted.

Make a well in the middle, crack in one of the eggs, add 2 tablespoons of cold water, then mix, pat and bring together., Place between two large sheets of greaseproof paper, flatten to 1.5cm thick and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes., Roll out the pastry between the sheets of greaseproof, then line a 25cm loose-bottomed tart tin with the pastry, easing and pushing it carefully into the sides and letting the pastry scruffily hang right over the sides (this will stop it shrinking). Prick the base all over with a fork and bake for 20 minutes, or until lightly golden, then trim off the excess pastry (sometimes I don’t bother as people seem to love the crispy bits)., Halve the asparagus spears, saving the tips for the quiche. Chop and place the rest in a large pan over a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil., Peel, roughly chop and add the potatoes and onions and strip in half the thyme leaves, and cook for 15 minutes, or until lightly golden, stirring regularly., Pour in the stock, bring to the boil, then simmer for 15 minutes. Whiz with a stick blender until smooth, pass through a sieve, then season to taste with salt and black pepper., While the soup is on the go, beat the remaining eggs in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and the ricotta, then grate in the Cheddar and pick in the remaining thyme leaves., Chop and add the reserved asparagus tips, then stir into the egg mixture and tip into the tart case., Bake for 40 minutes, or until beautifully golden. I like to serve the quiche and soup together – it’s a wonderful meal."

Mix up as best you can, then knead vigorously on a flour-dusted surface to give you a smooth, elastic dough. Rub lightly with oil, place in the bowl, cover with a clean damp tea towel and prove for 1 hour in a warm place, or until doubled in size., Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the onion and place in a pan with the butter, bay leaves and a splash of water. Fry on a medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring regularly, then stir in 50g of flour, followed by the mustard, and slowly add the milk to give you a loose white sauce. Roughly break up the cauliflower, discarding just the tatty outer leaves, and finely slice the stalk. Add to the pan with any remaining leaves. Simmer gently for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat, grate in the cheese, season to perfection and allow to cool a little., Preheat the oven to full whack (240ºC/475ºF/gas 9). Lightly oil a 30cm non-stick ovenproof frying pan or a 25cm x 35cm baking tray, then press out the dough to fill the space.

Sprinkle each cheese with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then pop one in its box in the centre of the tree, and another on a separate tray. Reserve the third cheese for later., Strip the remaining rosemary leaves and dot between the dough balls. Sprinkle with a good pinch of salt from a height, and drizzle with olive oil. Place the bread tree in the oven with the second cheese on the shelf below and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the Camemberts are gooey and the bread is risen and golden.

Put a large, high-sided pan on a medium heat and toast the hazelnuts as it heats up., Meanwhile, peel the onion, trim the fennel and finely chop both., Tip the hazelnuts into a pestle and mortar, returning the pan to the heat. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 knob of butter, followed by the chopped veg, then strip in the thyme leaves (reserving the soft tips for garnish)., Squeeze the sausagemeat out of the skins into the pan, breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, then stir in the rice to toast., After 2 minutes, pour in the wine and stir until absorbed., Now start adding the stock, a ladleful at a time, letting each one cook away before adding more, and stirring constantly for 16 to 18 minutes, or until the rice is cooked but still retains its shape., When done, add a splash of stock or water to make it oozy, then finely grate over most of the Parmesan, beat it in with the remaining butter, taste, and season to perfection., Turn the heat off, then bomb in little nuggets of fontina, so they melt subtly into the rice., Cover, and leave to rest off the heat for 2 minutes while you crush the nuts., Divide the risotto between warm plates, then finely grate over the remaining Parmesan., Sprinkle over the crushed nuts and thyme tips, then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil."

Slide onto a board and cut into 8 wedges., Destone ½ a ripe avocado (if needed), drizzle over 1 teaspoon each of extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar, then place on the board., Put 2 heaped tablespoons of natural yoghurt into a small bowl, and swirl through a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a few dashes of chipotle Tabasco., Serve the quesadilla wedges with the salad, avo and dollops of yoghurt. Slice ½ a lime into wedges for squeezing over, then get stuck in."

seconds, then drain in a colander and place in cold water. Peel away and discard the skins, then deseed the tomatoes and chop the flesh into 1cm chunks., Pick and finely chop the basil leaves, finely grate the lemon zest, then toss both with the tomatoes, a good splash of vinegar and a good pinch of sea salt., To start the sauce, peel and finely chop the onions. Melt the butter in a pan on a medium heat, add the onions and cook for 15 minutes, or until soft, stirring regularly., For the crêpes, melt the butter and let it cool a little while you pile the flour into a bowl with a pinch of salt. Make a well in the middle, whisk in the eggs, then gradually whisk in the milk and 70ml water until smooth. Stir in the melted butter, then leave to sit while you finish the sauce., Stir the flour into the onions to make a kind of roux, then gradually whisk in the milk until smooth. Stir in the mustard and a few scrapings of nutmeg, season, simmer for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat., Put a 26cm frying pan on a medium heat with a tiny knob of butter. Once melted, add just enough batter to coat the base of the pan, gently swirling to cover. Cook until lightly golden, then flip and cook on the other side., Repeat with the remaining batter, wiping out the pan with a ball of kitchen paper and adding a tiny knob of butter each time – you should end up with 6 crêpes., Meanwhile, grate and mix the cheeses, pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, and tear up the slices of ham., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Get yourself a deep ovenproof pan, 26cm in diameter. Repeat layers of crêpe, sauce, tomato (leaving any juices behind in the bowl), ham, cheese and parsley until you’ve used up all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of just sauce and cheese., Bake on the bottom shelf of the oven for 40 minutes, or until golden and bubbling, resting for 10 minutes before serving., Delicious served with a mixed garden salad with a French dressing made with walnut oil, and I also like to shave some walnuts on a box grater over the top of the salad for added crunch."

Put a bay leaf into each hollow and roast for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until soft., Meanwhile, rinse and drain the rice, tip into a pan and cover with plenty of water. Bring to the boil and simmer briskly for about 30 minutes or until just tender. Drain well and put to one side., While the rice cooks, peel, halve and slice the onions., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the onion and a large pinch of salt, then cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until soft., Roughly chop the chestnuts, then pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves. Add both to the softened onions. Reduce the heat slightly, and continue to cook for about 10 minutes, stirring whenever the onions begin to catch., Chop up the Dolcelatte, then stir into the onions along with the cooked wild rice and dried sour cherries. Season well., Divide this mixture between the roasted pumpkins, removing the bay leaves first., Return to the oven for 5 minutes, to warm everything through. Delicious served with peppery salad leaves."

Make a well in the middle and gradually pour in 550ml of tepid water, stirring and bringing in the flour from the outside to form a rough dough., Knead on a clean flour-dusted surface for 10 minutes, or until smooth and springy. Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a clean damp tea towel and prove in a warm place for 2 hours., Grease a large nice-shaped ovenproof tray with butter, then evenly scatter over the breadcrumbs., Leaving a 1cm rim around the edge, cut the rind off the top of each Camembert. Pick the tip off each rosemary sprig and poke into the soft cheeses, then peel the garlic, finely slice with the chillies, and poke those in, too., Sprinkle each cheese with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then place one cheese in the centre of the tray., Divide the dough into three pieces, then each of those into 10, giving you 30 in total. One-by-one, roll each piece into a ball and place on the tray, building out from the Camembert in a circular motion, like in the picture., Leave to prove for another hour, again covered with a damp tea towel., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Strip the rest of the rosemary leaves into a little pile, toss with a little oil, and scatter over the dough. Sprinkle with a good pinch of sea salt from a height, then bomb over tiny bits of butter, which will melt into the bread as it cooks., Bake for 30 minutes, or until the Camembert is gooey and the bread is risen and cooked through. Bang the tray in the middle of the table, and dive in – elbows at the ready, this one’s hard to resist., And what’s great is that you know you’ve got two cheeses in reserve, ready to bake. As soon as you serve the first Camembert, bake the second one in its box on a tray for about 20 minutes, then decant on to the bread tray, repeating again with the remaining cheese, as and when needed. Guaranteed happy customers, all round."

The quantities I’ve given you here mean you can utilize whole packets of Parmesan and nuts, and the method is so simple anyone can do it. This is one of those incredible recipes where minimum effort gives you maximum flavour, every time., Break the Parmesan into a food processor (discarding the rind). Rip in the leafy basil, discarding only the tougher base of the stalks., Peel and add the garlic, and tip in the pine nuts and almonds., Finely grate in the lemon zest, squeeze in all the juice, and pour in the oil. Blitz until fairly fine in consistency., The fresh pesto will keep well in the fridge for up to 3 days, and it freezes brilliantly. The easiest thing to do is roll the pesto up in greaseproof paper to make a log, then scrunch the ends like a cracker. Pop into the freezer for 2 hours, then, before it gets too hard, remove, unwrap and slice into the appropriate number of portions. Re-shape, re-roll and re-wrap, then pop it back into the freezer – it’ll be good for at least 3 months., To use from frozen, simply defrost overnight in the fridge, or whack it straight into a pan to melt."

give the coals time to get nice and hot., Pick the oregano and parsley leaves, peel and slice the onions into wedges, prick the aubergine all over with a fork and halve lengthways., Add the feta to a small bowl with half the oregano leaves, a drizzle of olive oil and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Set aside to marinate while you prepare the rest of the dish., Next make the tabbouleh. Cook the cracked wheat according to the packet instructions, then rinse and drain. Set it aside to cool a little., Pick and finely chop the mint and parsley, then finely chop the cucumber., Once the cracked wheat has cooled, mix in the mint, parsley and cucumber, a good squeeze of lemon juice and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Have a taste and tweak the seasoning to your liking, then cover and set aside., Once your barbecue is hot enough to start cooking, grill all of the vegetables and the garlic and, once beautifully charred on both sides, transfer them to a chopping board., Chop up all the veg together, squeezing the garlic cloves out of their skins and squishing the tomatoes. Roughly chop the parsley and remaining oregano leaves into the vegetables, season and drizzle with olive oil., Carefully griddle the whole marinated feta on the barbecue for about 3 minutes (this will depend how hot your barbecue is), or until golden and crispy, then gently turn and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes., Toast the pistachios in a small pan over a medium heat until lightly golden, then spoon over the honey and allow the nuts to caramelise, tossing regularly to stop them from catching in the pan (do not be tempted to touch them because they will be very hot!)., After a couple of minutes, tip them onto a sheet of oiled greaseproof paper to harden and cool, then roughly chop and leave to one side., Spoon the tabbouleh onto a large serving dish, then top with the chopped vegetables., Place the griddled feta in the centre, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and scatter over the crispy smashed pistachios. To serve, crumble the feta over the top. Delicious served with toasted flatbreads."

Leave it to one side to cool a little., Pour the milk into a large, heavy pan along with 800ml of water and 1 teaspoon of sea salt and bring it to the boil., Pour in the polenta in a thin stream, whisking all the time so it thickens as you go. Keep whisking for 2 to 3 minutes over a high heat., Turn down the heat to the lowest setting and cook it for about 40 minutes, or until the polenta starts to come away from the pan, stirring every 5 minutes to stop it sticking., Melt the butter, then pop half of it into a blender with the basil. Squeeze all of the garlic cloves out of their skins (discarding these) and add them to the basil, along with a good grating of nutmeg., Blitz to a vibrant green butter, then pour it into a small pan. Warm it through gently over a low heat, then set aside., When the polenta is ready, finely grate in the Parmesan and stir in the remaining butter. Serve immediately with the basil butter drizzled over the top, finished with an extra grating of Parmesan."

lemon zest. Pulse till you have fine crumbs., Add the eggs and pulse till a dough is formed (you can also rub the flour, butter, sugar and a grating of zest together until they resemble fine breadcrumbs, then add the eggs and bring together to form a dough)., Wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for 1 hour., Use butter to grease a 25cm loose-bottom tart tin. Roll out the pastry to ½cm thick and use it to line the tin., Trim and reserve the remaining pastry, then chill the lined tin in the freezer for 30 minutes., Preheat your oven to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3. Line the chilled tart tin with greaseproof paper, fill with baking beans and bake blind for 20 minutes, or until lightly golden., Combine the cooked wheat, milk, vanilla and half the lemon zest in a saucepan and bring to the boil., Reduce the heat and simmer until the wheat has absorbed all of the liquid. Remove from heat and allow to cool., In a bowl, mash the ricotta with a fork, stir in the egg yolks, then beat until light and fluffy., Sift in the icing sugar, then finely chop and add the candied peel, along with the orange-blossom water, orange zest and remaining lemon zest., Beat until combined, then stir in the wheat mixture., In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff, then carefully fold them into the wheat and ricotta mixture., Pour the filling into the tart case. Roll out the remaining pastry and cut into 2cm strips and use to create a rough criss-cross over the tart., Bake the tart for 50 minutes, or until golden., Allow it to cool, then dust with icing sugar. Serve slices with dollops of cream, scattered with orange zest and drizzled with honey, if you like."

Peas and broad beans are sweet and have a pleasant texture, so they should prove popular, even with fussy eaters. If you grow either of these vegetables in your garden, get the kids involved in picking and shelling them, although defrosted peas and beans from the freezer will work just as well here. If you want to make the dish more substantial, you can always add some cooked and sliced new potatoes. Frittata is a simple, healthy addition to your regular dinner repertoire, but also works as a cold dish on picnics. ”",239,15.9g,6.6g,2.1g,,17.4g,4.9g,,"100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                French beans, 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                    spring onions, 3                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh mint, 150                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                fresh or defrosted frozen peas or small broad beans, shelled, 6                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range eggs, 1                                                                                                                                                                knob of                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter, 40                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                goat's cheese, Parmesan cheese                                                                                                                                                                , for grating","Preheat your grill to medium, or your oven to 180ºC/gas 4., Bring a pan of water to the boil.

sauce","Before you start, soak the porcini mushrooms in boiling water and set aside., Peel and finely slice the garlic and onions (keep them separate), and pick the thyme leaves. Dice the potatoes., Heat a lug of oil in a large pan and fry the garlic, thyme leaves and butter over a medium heat until lightly golden., Add the onions, turn down the heat and sauté for 10 minutes, or until soft and sticky, but not coloured., Add the fresh mushrooms, turn up the heat and fry hard and fast for 5 minutes., Fish out and chop half of the soaked porcini, add to the pan and fry for a few more minutes., Add 350ml of the stock and the potatoes and season well. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for 30 minutes., Using a stick blender, blitz the mushrooms just a little – you want them to still be fairly chunky., Pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, then stir about half into the mix., Divide the filling between 6 small pie dishes, reserving 4 heaped tablespoons for later., Chop the Tunworth into 1-2cm pieces and scatter evenly into each of the pie dishes., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., To make the lids, roll out the pastry on a flour-dusted surface to roughly the thickness of a pound coin., Cut into 6 pieces, to the shape of your pie dishes, and lay one over the top of each, tucking the edges down slightly. Carefully score each pie lid with a crisscross, then gently press your thumb in the middle of each one to make a well (without puncturing the pastry)., Beat the egg and brush it over the pies, then place in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until puffed up and beautifully golden., Now to make the sauce. In a pan, stir the mustard and Worcestershire sauce into the remaining filling., Pour in the leftover porcini liquid, then roughly chop the remaining porcini and add to the mix., Place the pan over a high heat, pour in the remaining stock and bring everything to the boil. Stir in the rest of the parsley a minute or two before the end, then blitz in a liquidiser until smooth and pour into a jug., To serve, pour the gravy into the wells of the pies, and serve with a dollop of English mustard."

Peel and slice the garlic, then pick the thyme leaves., Put a large casserole-type pan (ideally one you’d be happy to serve in) on a medium heat and add a drizzle of oil, the butter, thyme leaves and garlic., Cook until it begins to bubble and fry, then stir in the leeks. Continue cooking and checking on it every few minutes to stir and make sure it doesn’t catch., At this point, you have two choices: one is good, one is great. You can either stir the rest of the ingredients into the leeks, grating in the Cheddar and Parmesan, and tearing in the brie, then put it into the oven to cook for 45 minutes uncovered, or, if you want the sweetest leeks in the world (and I think you do), do the following..., Turn the heat under the pan down a little and cook the leeks for about 35 minutes, or until soft and intensely gorgeous, stirring every now and then., Season, then spoon it all into a dish, or leave in the pan., Stir in the cream and splash of water, grate over the Cheddar and Parmesan, then pull the brie into parts and bomb those on top., Pop in the oven for 15 minutes, or until golden and bubbling."

Set aside., Toast the pine nuts in a dry frying pan, then transfer to a food processor with the sundried tomatoes, anchovies and 1½ tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Pick in most of the basil leaves., Blitz until you have a spreadable paste, then season with black pepper and pulse again to combine., Lay a slice of Parma ham on top of each aubergine strip, tearing off the excess to use again, and spread on a little sundried tomato paste., Tear the mozzarella into bite-sized pieces, then place a piece at one end of the strip along with a basil leaf. Roll up and secure with a tooth pick. Serve immediately."

Once hot, put heaped spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan to give you six popovers. Leave them to get nicely golden for a few minutes, then flip over and gently flatten to 1cm thick with a palette knife., Once golden on both sides, remove the popovers from the pan for a moment, then turn the heat off., Finely grate the Parmesan into the pan to melt. Place the popovers on top, wait for the Parmesan to sizzle and go golden from the residual heat of the pan, then use your palette knife to gently push the cheese towards each popover., Once the crispy popovers can be easily prised away from the pan with your palette knife, bang them out on to a board., Swirl some chilli sauce through the yoghurt, toss the rocket in a squeeze of lemon juice and serve both on the side, then enjoy!"

Add the olive oil, butter and garlic to a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Fry for 1 minute, add the mushrooms and chilli, then pick in the thyme leaves. Season with salt and pepper, add 100ml of boiling water, then cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until softened., Meanwhile, make the fritters. Place the ricotta into a large bowl and beat until smooth. Add the flour, egg and a few gratings of lemon zest. Finely grate in the Parmesan and ¼ of a nutmeg, season with salt and pepper and mix well to combine., Heat a good splash of olive oil in a medium pan over a medium heat, then add heaped tablespoons of the mixture (you’ll need to do this in batches), making sure you space them out nicely. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway, then transfer to a plate., Pick, roughly chop and add the parsley leaves to the mushrooms, add a squeeze of lemon juice and toss well. Divide between your plates, top with the fritters and enjoy."

tomato sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then fry in a good amount of olive oil until lightly coloured. Pick and tear the basil leaves, then add to the pan with the tomatoes. Using the back of a wooden spoon, mush and squash the tomatoes as much as you can. Season to taste., As soon as it comes to the boil, remove the pan from the heat. Strain the sauce through a coarse sieve into a bowl, using the spoon to push any larger bits of tomato through. Discard the basil and garlic left in the sieve, but scrape any tomatoey goodness off the back of the sieve into the bowl. Pour the sauce back into the pan, bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Cook until it’s the perfect consistency for spreading on your pizza bases., For the pizza dough, sieve the flour and salt onto a clean work surface and make a well in the middle. In a jug, mix the yeast, sugar and olive oil into 650ml lukewarm water and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well. Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. When it all starts to come together, work the rest of the flour in with your clean hands. Knead until you have a smooth, springy dough. Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for an hour until the dough has doubled in size., Remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out. You can use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in clingfilm, in the fridge (or freezer) until required. If using straight away, divide the dough up into 6 to 8 balls., Timing-wise, it’s a good idea to roll the pizza bases out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to cook them. Stack the pizza bases, with a square of oiled tin foil between each one, cover them with clingfilm, and pop them into the fridge. Now’s the time to get your wood-fired oven, or conventional oven, heated up to full whack. Place a couple of heavy baking trays in the oven to heat up, too., Meanwhile, click off the broccoli florets and roughly chop (using the stalk, too). Blanch in boiled salted water for 1 to 2 minutes, then drain. Tear the anchovies into small pieces, then deseed and finely chop the chilli. Squeeze the sausage meat out of their skins, then roll into small, rough meatballs., When you’re ready to assemble your pizzas, remove a tray from the oven, put a pizza base on it and assemble it quickly – smear tomato sauce on the base and dot with broccoli, torn up anchovy fillets and sausage meatballs. Tear over the Taleggio cheese and sprinkle with chilli. Crush and scatter over the fennel seeds. Place in the oven immediately while you prepare the remaining pizzas. If you’re using a wood-fired oven the pizzas should cook, one by one, in about 3 to 4 minutes – you want them to be puffed up, crispy and delicious. In a regular oven, they’ll take 8 to 10 minutes. Serve hot."

Put your biscuits into a food processor and whiz until you’ve got really fine crumbs, then mix in your melted butter. If you don’t have a food processor, just wrap your biscuits in a tea towel and bash them up with a rolling pin until fine. Spread the biscuit mixture around the base of your greased tin, making sure you get it right to the edges, then press it with your hands to pack it down. Place the tin on a baking sheet and pop it into the fridge while you make the filling., Whiz the cream cheese in a food processor until smooth, then gradually add the sugar. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each one. Pour in the lime juice and vanilla seeds or extract and whiz again until just combined. Again, if you don’t have a food processor, just do this by hand. Don’t worry if the mixture seems too thin – it’s supposed to be like that. Tip it over your chilled biscuit base, spread it out evenly, and bake in the oven for around 45 to 55 minutes – you want the cheesecake to still have a slight loose wobble. Remove from the oven and set aside for 15 minutes to cool slightly. Turn the oven up to 220°C/425°F/gas 7., To make the meringue topping, put your egg whites into a clean bowl and beat until they form soft peaks – an electric whisk is quite handy here. Gradually add the caster sugar and beat until thick and glossy. Finally, fold in the coconut. Spoon this meringue mixture on to the middle of the cooled cheesecake and spread it to the edges, using the back of a spoon, so it just covers the filling. It should be about 2cm thick. I like to make a few ripples and peaks in the top so it looks impressive. Bake in the oven for 5 minutes, or until the meringue is starting to turn golden in colour and is crisp to touch. Let it cool down, then place it in the fridge for a few hours (this is important) to chill before serving., Carefully remove it from the tin, transfer it to a nice platter and sprinkle over the lime zest. Really nice served with mango, strawberries and raspberries when they’re in season."

Cut your bacon into thick 1cm lardons (have a look at the picture – that's roughly the size your croutons and bacon should be), and add to the pan. Fry, stirring occasionally, for around 3 minutes, or until you’ve got a good bit of colour on the bacon and a lot of the fat has rendered out. Turn the heat down a little and add your bread to the pan, making sure you spread the croutons out so they take on some colour. Fry for another 3 minutes, or until they’ve sucked up all the wonderful flavour and are lovely, crisp and golden., Put the extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper into a clean jam jar. Put the lid on and give it a shake, then have a taste and make sure you’ve got the balance right. You want it to be slightly too acidic at this stage, as you’ll get quite a bit of saltiness from the bacon and French dressings tend to be quite sharp., Once your dressing is made, get everyone around the table so they’re ready to tuck in as soon as the salad is ready. Put your salad leaves on a big platter, tear in the radicchio, then pour over that wonderful, thick dressing. Scatter over most of your walnuts and chives and all the croutons and lardons. Quickly mix it all up with your clean hands so that every single leaf is coated., Use the tip of a knife to crumble off little nuggets of Roquefort and let them fall straight on to your salad. Finish by scattering over the rest of the walnuts and chives from a height, and tuck in."

Once this has been chopped up nice and fine, I add a couple more chopped tomatoes, a good pinch of salt and half of another avocado, chopped, to give it a nice chunky texture. Transfer everything into a bowl and season carefully with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon or lime juice. If you decide to buy ready-made guacamole, which is a bit lazy but probably very realistic, you can put it into a bowl and chirp it up a bit with a squeeze of lemon juice, a little extra salt and a bit of chilli to give it a kick., To fill the quesadillas you will need a couple of big handfuls of grated Cheddar and/or Red Leicester cheese, some finely sliced spring onions, a couple of handfuls of chopped fresh coriander, and a red pepper and some red or green chillies all deseeded and finely chopped. Mix all this up in a bowl and then sprinkle half a handful between two layers of tortilla. You can make up 4, 10 or even 20 quesadillas and keep them in the fridge until you need them if you want., Some people like to fry them in oil, but this makes them greasy and is not all that healthy. You can grill them, but I like to put them in a dry non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, so that after about a minute and a half on each side you are left with a really crispy outside and an oozy, stringy filling. Serve the quesadillas cut into quarters, with the guacamole, soured cream and a beer., PS You can also posh them up a bit using grilled chicken or seafood, leftover pork, shellfish, or a selection of grilled vegetables."

Chop the squash in half and scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon. Slice each half lengthways into 4 wedges and place in a bowl., Sprinkle over the chilli, coriander, nutmeg and cloves and a little salt and pepper. Toss with the sage leaves and a splash of oil, place on a roasting tray, then roast for 40 minutes or until softened, cooked through and lightly browned., Carefully cut the squash into large cubes, cutting away the skin, and tear the mozzarella up into similar-sized pieces. Thread a cocktail stick through a ring of chilli, then through a basil leaf folded in half, then through a piece of mozzarella and then finally into a chunk of squash., Repeat until all the bits of squash and mozzarella are used up, then drizzle with olive oil before serving."

It's not very often that mozzarella gets cooked in a credible way but this is one time it does. I love the whole idea of putting the bread, mozzarella and smoky bacon together because when cooked they complement each other so well – the bread goes really crisp and soaks up all the lovely juices, the milky mozzarella starts to melt and go really gooey, and served with a fresh herb salad it's lovely. Great for a starter or a snack, and I've even made little mini ones as canapés (dare I say that word?!)., Remove the crusts from the ciabatta and tear up into rough 2.5cm/1 inch pieces. Throw into a bowl with the bacon and lemon zest. Divide each mozzarella into 8 similar-sized pieces and add to the bowl. Keeping the leaf tips on the rosemary sticks, remove the lower leaves and then smash these up in a pestle and mortar with the garlic. Stir in 8 tablespoons of olive oil, then pour this mixture over the bread, cheese and bacon. Marinate for anything from 15 minutes to an hour., Thread your mozzarella and bread on to your rosemary sticks, weaving the bacon in and around. Line up the kebabs on a wire rack and place under the grill on a very high heat until the bread and bacon are golden and crisp and the mozzarella is nice and gooey. While this is grilling make sure you keep an eye on it, as it can turn into a charred kebab very quickly. To make the dressing, chop up the olives and mix with the chilli, 5 tablespoons of the lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Season to taste., To serve the kebabs, dress the herbs with half of the olive dressing right at the last minute so the leaves stay nice and fresh, then use the other half of the dressing drizzled over the kebabs., Try this: Do exactly the same as above but swap the mozzarella for cubes of fresh white fish such as haddock, cod or monkfish."

Mix in the yoghurt, then the zest and juice of the lemon, and season to taste with freshly ground black pepper. Simple!, Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Tear the bread into rough pieces of about an inch or so and scatter into a roasting tin. Drizzle the bread with a little olive oil then toss with a good pinch of sea salt and bake for 10 minutes or until crunchy., Trim the bottoms of the little gems then break up each one, keeping the leaves whole. Give the watercress and lettuce leaves a quick wash, then dry in a salad spinner and lay on a large serving plate. Cut the top off the fennel and hang on to the feathery parts. Trim the bottom of the bulb and discard the scruffy outer leaves. Cut the bulb in half and slice as thinly as possible from the root to the tip, then add to the rest of the leaves. Next, fry the slices of halloumi on both sides in a little olive oil until golden, then drain on kitchen paper. Add the halloumi and croutons to the serving plate. Season, give the whole lot a gentle toss, then drizzle over the yoghurt dressing. Chop the fennel tops and bash the pomegranate to get the seeds out, then scatter the fennel and seeds over the salad."

crush the biscuits, then mix together in a bowl. Lightly press into the base of the prepared tin and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool., Turn the oven up to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Combine the sugar and cornflour in a bowl, add the cream cheese and beat, ideally with an electric whisk, until creamy., Crack in the eggs and beat well, then gradually add the cream, beating until smooth., Halve the vanilla pod lengthways, then scrape out the seeds and add to the bowl (if using), or add the vanilla extract, then finely grate in the lemon and orange zest., Scrape the mixture on to the biscuit base, and gently shake to level out the surface., Bake the cheesecake in the centre of the oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the top is golden and the filling has set around the edges (cover with a piece of tin foil, if browning too much)., Let it cool at room temperature and serve after 2 or 3 hours, or, for a slightly firmer texture, place it in the fridge until it’s nice and cold., Before serving, destone the cherries and place in a pan, then sprinkle over the sugar and add a splash of water. Put on a medium-low heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes – if you’ve got some port or whisky handy, feel free to add some., Once reduced, it may be a little dry, so add a splash of water to loosen, if needed. Leave to cool, then serve spooned over the cheesecake with a dusting of icing sugar."

Leaving it in the box, score around the top of a 250g Camembert about ½cm in and cut off the top layer of skin. Finely slice a peeled garlic clove and poke it into the top of the cheese with a few fresh rosemary tips. Drizzle with a little olive oil then bake in the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until gorgeous and oozy in the middle., Thread bite-sized pieces of stale bread onto stripped woody rosemary sprigs, drizzle them with olive oil and a tiny pinch of sea salt to help them crisp up then lay them on a tray and pop in the oven to cook with the Camembert., Finely chop a small handful of dried cranberries and mixed nuts and put them in a little bowl. Once your bread skewers are golden and crisp and your cheese is oozy, put everything out on a board then dunk a bit of toasted bread in the gooey cheese and dip it in the cranberry and nuts – a little mouthful of 1980s heaven."
