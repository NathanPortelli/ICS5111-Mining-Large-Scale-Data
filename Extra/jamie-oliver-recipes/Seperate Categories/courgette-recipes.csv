I would usually serve it with some grilled bread rubbed with garlic and olive oil. Try to use medium-sized firm courgettes (zucchini), as the big soft ones tend to break up and can be a bit wet. If you can’t get fresh plum tomatoes, use tomato passata instead – about 300ml should do it. ”",,,,,,,,,"3                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                extra-virgin olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onion                                                                                                                                                                , finely sliced, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    courgettes                                                                                                                                                                , (zucchini), sliced into 1cm (½in) rounds, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ripe plum tomatoes                                                                                                                                                                , finely chopped, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                chopped thyme leaves, 150                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                mozzarella                                                                                                                                                                , (5½oz), roughly cut into 1cm (½in) chunks, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried breadcrumbs                                                                                                                                                                , (1¾oz), 75                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Parmesan                                                                                                                                                                , (2½oz), grated, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper","Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/400°F/Gas 6. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. When hot, add the onion and cook for 3 minutes, then add the courgettes and ½ teaspoon of salt and reduce the heat to low. Cook the courgettes for 15 minutes, until they have a little colour and the onions are soft. Add the tomatoes and thyme and cook over a low heat for a further 15 minutes, until everything has a similar texture. Check the seasoning, remove from the heat and set aside., Use the remaining olive oil to grease the inside of a small baking dish. Tip the courgette and tomato mixture into the dish, then top it with the mozzarella. Mix the breadcrumbs and Parmesan together and sprinkle the mixture evenly over the top of the dish., Bake the dish for 20 minutes, until the top is golden and bubbling, then remove it from the oven and leave it to rest for 5 minutes before serving."

Pour 325ml of tepid water into a jug. Add the yeast and mix with a fork for a couple of minutes, until dissolved. Add a pinch of the flour and mix well, then pour the yeast mixture into the bowl. Use a fork to mix it all together until you can’t move it anymore – this will stop the dough sticking to your hands., Now get your clean hands in there and bring it together as a ball of dough, kneading and moving it around the bowl until the dough comes away from the sides., Transfer the dough to a flour-dusted surface and keep it moving, kneading, pushing and stretching it for 5 minutes, or until you have a silky and elastic dough., Use your floured hands to shape the dough into a rough ball, put it in an oiled bowl, and cover with a clean, damp tea towel. Allow it to prove for about an hour, or until doubled in size – ideally in a warm, draught-free place., Meanwhile, drizzle 1 tablespoon each of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar into a large bowl. Tear in the basil leaves, then halve the tomatoes and finely slice the courgette, adding them to the bowl as you go. Squash, destone and tear over the flesh of the olives and toss everything together gently with your hands., Once the dough has doubled in size, knock the air out by punching it with your fist, then knead on a flour-dusted surface for 30 seconds, or until smooth., Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to about the size of a tea towel, then rub the red pesto all over the dough using your hands, spreading it out to the edges. Scatter over the courgette mix evenly and tear over the mozzarella., Roll up the dough lengthways, like a Swiss roll, wrapping all the lovely fillings inside, then with a sharp knife, cut into twelve chunks. Place the pieces close together, swirl-side up, in an ovenproof pan (about 26cm) or on a snug, oiled baking tray, then cover with a clean tea towel. Leave to prove again for 30 minutes to an hour, or until it has doubled in size., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Bake on the bottom of the oven for about 35 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Turn the loaf out onto a board and allow to cool slightly before serving. Delicious!"

Coarsely grate them on a box grater with the courgette and mushrooms, then tip everything into a large frying pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened., Tip the cooked vegetables into a bowl and leave to cool. Add the minced beef and pork into the cooled vegetables along with the breadcrumbs. Finely grate in most of the Parmesan cheese and crack in the egg, then season with a little black pepper. With clean hands, squish and squash the mixture together until it’s all nicely combined. Now wash your hands!, With wet hands, take tablespoons of the mixture and shape into 24 little balls. Pop them onto a tray and leave in the fridge to firm up for 10 minutes or so. Wash your hands again., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1 teaspoon of oil. Add the balls into the pan and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown and gnarly all over, turning regularly., Peel and finely chop the remaining garlic cloves. Create a little space in the pan in between the meatballs, add the garlic for 2 minutes, then pour in the passata. Give the pan a gentle shake so the balls are evenly coated in the sauce. Simmer for 30 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce is thick and delicious, stirring occasionally."

It might seem stage-y, but when you combine all the different elements in one joyful bowl at the end you’ll be so pleased you went to all that effort. Also, everything here is quick to do, so it’s not a long one in terms of total time. I’ve given you quantities for the veg I used, but you basically want about 600g of crunchy veg in total (as well as the salad). When it comes to the actual stir-frying, it’s best to do no more than 2 portions at a time so you can retain maximum control.

the tough ends off the broccoli stalks, then halve any thicker stalks. Blanch in a pan of boiling salted water for a few minutes, until just cooked, then remove and toss with the sesame oil. If using eggs, cook in the water for 7 minutes, then remove, cool under running water and peel. Place in a reusable bag with the Worcestershire sauce and twist to seal, letting the sauce stain the eggs., Use a fork to scrape down the length of the cucumber, all the way round – this helps the dressing to cling on. Cut at an angle into 1cm slices then, in a bowl, mix with the soy sauce and lime juice. Set aside, turning the cucumber slices occasionally, so they soak up all that lovely flavour., Click the lettuce leaves apart, then wash and place in a bowl of cold water so they remain lovely and crisp. Simply drain and spin dry when ready to serve., Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain, refresh and cool under cold running water, and set aside., Trim the leek and halve lengthways, wash, then cut into 5cm lengths and finely slice – we’re looking for harmony between the size of the veg and the noodles., Peel the carrots. Trim and slice the courgettes and carrots lengthways, then cut into batons., Put a non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat. Toast the nuts as it heats up, removing to a pestle and mortar once golden. Bash until crushed and set aside., Trim the pork of any sinew, then cut into 1½cm thick rounds. Place in the pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and cook for 5 minutes, or until golden and just cooked through, turning halfway. Turn the heat off and spoon over the hoisin sauce, then pile the broccoli at one side of the pan to warm through., Alongside, put a large non-stick frying pan or wok on a medium-high heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil., Sprinkle half the chopped veg, half the peas and beans, and half the noodles into a pan. Stir-fry over the heat for just a couple of minutes, then divide between serving bowls., Portion up some hoisin pork and broccoli, add half an egg to each bowl (if using), with some cucumber and lettuce. Pick over some herb leaves, scatter over some nuts, then drizzle with chilli sauce, to taste. Let two lucky people tuck in, while you rattle out the remaining portions."
Roasted veggie curry | Jamie Oliver recipes,Spiced spinach-stuffed naan,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/106021898.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '8']",10 minutes,"“Roasting the veg before immersing them in a ridiculously tasty sauce really intensifies their natural flavour, giving you even more bang for your buck. I’ve kept things fairly gentle on the spice front so that all my kids will give it a go, but feel free to add extra heat, if you like. I’m also giving you a cheat’s naan, which all my kids fight over. We’re using it as a vehicle to really bring spinach to life, but feel free to stuff with another veg of your choice, or to not stuff it at all! If you’re feeding fewer than 8 people, leftover portions of this curry freeze really well (see tip), so fill your boots.  ”",345,13.6g,6g,12.6g,1.6g,10.7g,47.8g,6.6g,"1

to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., In a large roasting tray, mix the curry paste with a pinch of sea salt, 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon of vinegar., Wash the parsnip, carrots and butternut squash (we’re leaving the skins on). Quarter the parsnip lengthways, remove the fluffy core and chop into bite-sized chunks (about 2cm), adding to the tray as you go., Repeat with the courgette, then chop up the carrots. Deseed the squash and chop to a similar size. Get it all in the tray with the cauliflower and mix until well coated., Roast the veg for 40 to 50 minutes, or until golden, gnarly and cooked through., Meanwhile, for the sauce, put a large shallow casserole pan on a medium heat. Peel and finely chop the ginger and garlic, and place in the pan with 1 tablespoon of oil, stirring regularly., As soon as it starts to colour, stir in the mango chutney. Let it sizzle for a minute, then pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with your spoon. As soon as they start to bubble, add the coconut milk. Bring it to the boil, then turn off the heat., To make the naans, melt the butter in a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat, then add the cloves and cinnamon stick., Trim the leek and quarter lengthways, wash, finely slice and add to the pan, followed by the spinach. Stir regularly, until dark, dry and intense, then remove and leave to cool., Pour the flour into a large bowl with a pinch of salt, make a well in the middle and add 1 mug (300ml) of water (using the same mug you used to measure your flour, a regular cup is fine) and 1 tablespoon of oil. Use a fork to gradually mix the flour into the liquid, until it gets too hard to mix., At this point, use your clean floured hands to knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for a couple of minutes, adding a little extra flour, if needed. You want it to be pliable so don’t add too much flour, but it shouldn’t be sticking to your work surface., Now, oil your surface, then stretch and push the dough out into a 30cm circle. Crumble the feta over the cool spinach mixture and mix together, then place in the middle of the dough, leaving a 5cm border at the edge., Fold in the dough over the filling, patting it together as you go and sealing the filling inside, then pat out to just under 25cm. Wipe out your frying pan, then gently lift the naan into it., Cook the naan at the bottom of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and crisp on the outside, fluffy in the middle., A few minutes before you’re ready to serve, bring the sauce back to a simmer, then add all the roasted veg and the frozen peas, and simmer until the peas are cooked and the sauce is a good consistency., Slice up your naan and serve up with your curry at the table. Nice with a dollop of yoghurt and any chutney or pickles, if you like."

I’m riffing off local produce, plus adding a handful of non-traditional ingredients to max out a little more flavour. It may not be authentic, but it’s brilliant fun to make and fantastic for sharing.

Beautiful courgette carbonara | Jamie Oliver pasta recipes,Made the proper Italian way with penne,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/94356757.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '6']",In20 minutes,"“Carbonara is a classic pasta sauce made with cream, bacon and Parmesan and is absolutely delicious. I've added gorgeous courgettes for a summery twist. Try to buy the best ingredients you can, as that’s what really helps to make this dish amazing. I’m using a flowering variety of thyme but normal thyme is fine to use. When it comes to the type of pasta, you can serve carbonara with spaghetti or linguine, but I’ve been told by Italian mammas (who I don’t argue with!) that penne is the original, so that’s what I’m using in this recipe. Before you start cooking, it’s important to get yourself a very large pan, or use a high-sided roasting tray so you can give the pasta a good toss. ”",459,14.3g,5.4g,6.5g,0.8g,20.4g,66g,4.2g,"6                                                                                                                                                                medium                                                                                                                                                                green and yellow courgettes, 500                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                penne, 4                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                eggs, 100                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                single cream, 1                                                                                                                                                                small handful of                                                                                                                                                                Parmesan cheese, olive oil, 6                                                                                                                                                                slices of                                                                                                                                                                back bacon, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh thyme                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), a few                                                                                                                                                                                                                    courgette flowers                                                                                                                                                                , (optional)","Put a large pan of salted water on to boil., Halve and then quarter any larger courgettes lengthways. Cut out and discard any fluffy middle bits, and slice the courgettes at an angle into pieces roughly the same size and shape as the penne. Smaller courgettes can simply be sliced finely., Your water will now be boiling, so add the penne to the pan and cook according to the packet instructions., To make your creamy carbonara sauce, separate the eggs and put the yolks into a bowl (saving the whites for another recipe). Add the cream and grate in half the Parmesan, and mix together with a fork. Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, and put to one side., Heat a very large frying pan (a 35cm one is a good start – every house should have one!) and add a good splash of olive oil. Cut the pancetta or bacon into chunky lardons and fry until dark brown and crisp., Add the courgette slices and 2 big pinches of black pepper, not just to season but to give it a bit of a kick. Pick, chop and sprinkle in the thyme leaves (reserving any flowers), give everything a stir, so the courgettes become coated with all the lovely bacon-flavoured oil, and fry until they start to turn lightly golden and have softened slightly., It’s very important to get this next bit right or your carbonara could end up ruined. You need to work quickly. When the pasta is cooked, drain it, reserving a little of the cooking water. Immediately, toss the pasta in the pan with the courgettes, bacon and lovely flavours, then remove from the heat and add a ladleful of the reserved cooking water and your creamy sauce. Stir together quickly. (No more cooking now, otherwise you’ll scramble the eggs.), Get everyone around the table, ready to eat straight away. While you’re tossing the pasta and sauce, grate in the rest of the Parmesan and add a little more of the cooking water if needed, to give you a silky and shiny sauce. Taste quickly for seasoning., If you’ve managed to get any courgette flowers, tear them over the top, then serve and eat immediately, as the sauce can become thick and stodgy if left too long."

Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed., Carefully fill each courgette flower with the mixture, then press and pat the petals back together to seal., Halve the tomatoes, trim and slice the spring onions and destone and tear the olives. Deseed and roughly chop the chilli, then peel and roughly chop the garlic. Put everything into a 25cm x 35cm roasting tray., Drizzle with 2 tablespoons each of oil and vinegar, then season with pepper and scrunch together well. Stir in the rice and 700ml of boiling water, then place over the hob and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally., Lightly push the courgettes into the rice, and bake at the bottom of the oven for 20 minutes, or until beautifully golden. Delicious with a summery salad and a glass of chilled dry white wine."

Finely slice the tomatoes into rounds., Randomly bomb the pesto over the rice, then start layering up your veg: cover the rice with rounds of onion, then move on to a layer of courgettes, overlapping them as you go, followed by a layer of tomatoes. Repeat, moving slightly nearer the middle each time until you’ve covered the whole surface (use the picture to help you out – it might look a bit fiddly, but it’s child’s play to make)., Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper, then place under the grill on the middle shelf for 25 minutes, or until beautifully gratinated., Meanwhile, for the tapenade, destone and very finely chop the olives, then mix with ½ a tablespoon each of vinegar and extra virgin olive oil., To serve, pick over the basil leaves, dot over the olive tapenade and delicately tear over the mozzarella."

very gently apply pressure so that the liquid starts to drip through into a bowl, then leave to drain., Halve the tomatoes, season with sea salt and black pepper, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar, then toss and leave to macerate (this really brings out the flavour)., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Peel and finely slice the garlic, then place in a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat with the fennel seeds and 2 tablespoons of olive oil., Fry for a few minutes, stirring regularly, while you prep the veg, adding to the pan as you go: trim, wash and slice the leek, scrub the potatoes, squash (deseed, if needed) and courgettes and chop into 2cm chunks., Cover and cook for 15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, then remove the lid, tip in the chickpeas (juices and all) and season lightly with a pinch of salt and pepper., Finely chop the preserved lemon, discarding any pips, then add to the pan with a drizzle of juice from the jar, and the harissa. Fry for a further 15 minutes, or until beautifully caramelised, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, cover the sour cherries and saffron with 300ml of boiling water, leave for a few minutes, then add to the pan with the tomatoes, reserving the macerating juices., Lay the filo out flat, then brush all over with the reserved tomato juices. Roughly scrunch, wave and layer the filo into the pan, partly tucking it in at the edges (there’s no need to be neat)., Scatter over the sesame seeds and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Transfer the yoghurt to a plate and drizzle with a little oil from the harissa jar, then serve with the pie."

The genius thing is you simply prep all the veg so it cooks in the same time as the rice, meaning you can embrace different seasonal produce, which Linda was very cool about, ducking and diving so the recipe suits you. ”",472,16g,3.4g,4.2g,0.7g,13.2g,65g,2.6g,"300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                potatoes, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onion, 1                                                                                                                                                                clove of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 2                                                                                                                                                                sticks of                                                                                                                                                                celery, 400                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                ripe cherry tomatoes, 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh flat-leaf parsley                                                                                                                                                                , (30g), 60                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Parmesan cheese, 400                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                Prosecco, extra virgin olive oil, 500                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                long-grain rice, 750                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                mussels                                                                                                                                                                , scrubbed, debearded, from sustainable sources, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    courgette","Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Peel the potatoes, then, one at a time, cut them lengthways into quarters and erratically slice them to about the thickness of a coin, the rougher the better. Place in an ovenproof earthenware pot or small casserole pan., Peel the onion, garlic and celery, then randomly finely chop with the tomatoes and parsley (stalks and all), and add to the pot., Finely grate in half the Parmesan, then pour in the Prosecco and 8 tablespoons of oil. Add the rice, season with sea salt and black pepper, then mix everything together really well., Pick through the mussels and tap any open ones – if they don’t close, discard. Now you’ve got two choices. Linda shucks the raw mussels, which is fiddly but you’ll get the hang of it and it gives the most incredible depth of flavour from the sea. Use a small sharp knife to carefully prise open the shells and pull out each raw mussel and its juices. Or, simply put the mussels into a really hot pan, cover, and steam for 3 to 4 minutes until they pop open. Once cool enough to handle, remove the shells (discarding any that remain closed)., Either way, stir the mussels and any juices into the pot, then finely slice the courgette and layer on top like a lid. Gently push down to submerge in the flavours, then finely grate over the remaining Parmesan., Place on a high heat, and as soon as it starts to bubble, transfer to the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden. Rest for 10 minutes, then serve."

just 2 minutes, then use a slotted spoon to scoop it straight into the frying pan, letting some starchy cooking water go with it., Pick in most of the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh basil (15g), tearing up any larger ones, then add 25g of pine nuts and a good squeeze of lemon juice., Finely grate over 15g of Parmesan, then toss together and let the sauce emulsify., Toss the salad together,

I love the way she uses pecorino as a seasoning, which is contrary to the ‘no cheese and fish’ rule, while the crushed almonds give texture, creaminess and depth of flavour. To make this recipe sing like Pavarotti, you really need baby or crunchy courgettes, so it’s best made in the summer. ”",581,23.3g,4.5g,8.6g,0.8g,34g,62.9g,3.7g,"50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                whole almonds, 1                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                onion, 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    anchovy fillets in oil                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources, olive oil, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried fettuccine                                                                                                                                                                , or linguine, 4                                                                                                                                                                baby                                                                                                                                                                courgettes                                                                                                                                                                , with flowers, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                yellowfin tuna                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources, 1 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                quality cherry tomatoes, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 30                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                pecorino cheese, extra virgin olive oil","Lightly toast the almonds in a large frying pan on a medium heat, then tip into a pestle and mortar, leaving the pan on the heat., Peel the onion and garlic, finely chop with the anchovies and add to the pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil.

Peel the garlic, deseed and roughly chop the chillies, finely grate the zest of 1 lemon and place in a pestle and mortar. Add a pinch of sea salt and pound to a paste., To make the dressing, squeeze the juice of the zested lemon into a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of oil, season with salt and black pepper and put in the fridge until needed., Place the chicken wings and prawns on a tray and rub all over with half of the oregano paste, making sure you get it into all the nooks and crannies. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge overnight., Soak the wooden skewers in water before use – this will prevent them from catching on the barbecue., When you're ready to cook, preheat the oven to 160ºC/325ºF/gas 3, then prepare the barbecue., Carefully place the chicken wings onto the wooden skewers; start at the wing tip and push the meat onto the skewer. Do the same with the prawns; start with the head, pushing the skewer all of the way along the body. Pop the prawns back into the fridge., Place the chicken wings on a large baking tray and cook for 1 hour, or until cooked through., Cut the courgettes into 3cm chunks, then slide them onto the remaining skewers. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil and season with salt and pepper., Remove the dressing from the fridge and let it come up to room temperature., When the coals of your barbecue are glowing and the flames have died down, place the skewers on the grill and cook until golden – this should take about 3 minutes on each side., Serve on a platter, drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle over the reserved oregano.

First up, it’s great for embracing whatever veg you’ve got to hand – fresh, frozen or tinned, it’s all good. Secondly, tomato sauce is so versatile – you can use it for lasagne, curry, pasta sauce, chilli, on pizza, in a soup, you name it. Finally, it makes a big batch, so portion it up and freeze it, so you’re prepped for future meals. I’ve used two tins of tomatoes here, but feel free to chuck more in (if you’ve got them) to make the sauce go further. ”",32,1g,0.1g,3.6g,0.1g,1.3g,4.8g,1g,"2                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                onions, 2                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                leeks, 2                                                                                                                                                                sticks of                                                                                                                                                                celery, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    carrots, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    courgettes, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red peppers, ½ a                                                                                                                                                                                                                    butternut squash                                                                                                                                                                 , (600g), 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, olive oil, 2                                                                                                                                                                teaspoons                                                                                                                                                                dried oregano, 2 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tins of                                                                                                                                                                quality plum tomatoes","Start with your veg prep – you can either do this by hand (which is a great way to practise your knife skills) or, in batches, rattle it all through a food processor., Peel the onions, wash and trim the leeks, celery, carrots and courgettes, deseed the peppers and squash (there’s no need to peel it), then finely chop it all. Peel the garlic and finely chop by hand., Put a super-large pan on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the garlic and oregano, fry for 1 minute, then add all the prepped veg., Cook with the lid on for 25 minutes, or until the veg are soft but not coloured, stirring regularly., Pour in the tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, then just under half-fill each tin with water, swirl around and pour into the pan., Simmer for 25 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced. Leave to cool a little, then blitz until smooth, taste, and season to perfection."

Halve the courgettes lengthways and thinly slice, then halve the tomatoes., Put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, the garlic and chilli. Fry for 2 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden., Add the courgettes and tomatoes, and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened., Add the pine nuts and 3 tablespoons of boiling water from the pot. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently while you cook the pasta., Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until al dente – this means it’s cooked, but still has a bit of bite., Meanwhile, pick the basil leaves, reserving the small, pretty ones for serving., Reserving a cupful of the cooking water, drain the pasta, then return to the pan, off the heat. Add the sauce and spinach leaves, then stir until the spinach is wilted and the pasta is nicely coated, adding a splash of the cooking water to loosen, if needed., Finely grate in most of the cheese and fold in the big basil leaves. Serve immediately with a final grating of cheese and the reserved basil leaves sprinkled on top."

Set aside to marinate while you prepare the rest of the dish., Next make the tabbouleh. Cook the cracked wheat according to the packet instructions, then rinse and drain. Set it aside to cool a little., Pick and finely chop the mint and parsley, then finely chop the cucumber., Once the cracked wheat has cooled, mix in the mint, parsley and cucumber, a good squeeze of lemon juice and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Have a taste and tweak the seasoning to your liking, then cover and set aside., Once your barbecue is hot enough to start cooking, grill all of the vegetables and the garlic and, once beautifully charred on both sides, transfer them to a chopping board., Chop up all the veg together, squeezing the garlic cloves out of their skins and squishing the tomatoes. Roughly chop the parsley and remaining oregano leaves into the vegetables, season and drizzle with olive oil., Carefully griddle the whole marinated feta on the barbecue for about 3 minutes (this will depend how hot your barbecue is), or until golden and crispy, then gently turn and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes., Toast the pistachios in a small pan over a medium heat until lightly golden, then spoon over the honey and allow the nuts to caramelise, tossing regularly to stop them from catching in the pan (do not be tempted to touch them because they will be very hot!)., After a couple of minutes, tip them onto a sheet of oiled greaseproof paper to harden and cool, then roughly chop and leave to one side., Spoon the tabbouleh onto a large serving dish, then top with the chopped vegetables., Place the griddled feta in the centre, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and scatter over the crispy smashed pistachios. To serve, crumble the feta over the top. Delicious served with toasted flatbreads."

It’s a good staple for older kids to learn how to cook, as they can pair it with any flavours they like, or vegetables that are in season. We think kids will like the way the asparagus and courgettes are peeled to resemble the pasta ribbons (we do too). Peeling is a useful skill that even little children can learn, while older children can master cooking and assembling. You could make your own pasta if you have a machine – it’s a fun activity for everyone to get involved in., Fill a large saucepan with water, add a big pinch of sea salt and bring it to the boil., Peel the vegetables into ribbons with a speed peeler. Set aside., Break the eggs into a big mixing bowl, add the crème fraîche and Parmesan cheese, and finely grate in the lemon zest. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper, then mix well., Cook the pasta in the large pan of boiling water according to the packet directions., Heat a glug of oil in a large pan. Chop and add the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes, until crisp., Setting aside a cupful of water, drain the pasta., Off the heat, add the pasta to the pancetta, pick in most of the mint, then add the veg ribbons, egg mixture and a splash of pasta water., Stir it all together, then add more pasta water if you think it needs it., Dish it up, then top each bowl with the remaining mint leaves and an extra grating of Parmesan."

Carefully cut the pastry block in half with a table knife. Wrap the other half and refrigerate or freeze for later., Dust some flour onto a clean work surface and, using a rolling pin, roll out the pastry into a square, measuring 26cm x 26cm. Cut into 4 equal squares., Place the pastry squares on a baking tray, leaving a space between each., Using the back of a spoon, spread the centre of each square with pesto, but don’t spread it onto the edges., Squash the tomatoes into a large mixing bowl, then snap the asparagus spears into 3cm pieces. Keep the lovely pointy tips and a little of the stalk, but discard the end 3cm., Using a speed peeler, carefully shred the courgettes into ribbons. Tear the roasted peppers into strips and add to the bowl., Pick the basil leaves, reserving the pretty ones for later. Place the large ones in the mixing bowl., Mix the vegetables together in the bowl, adding a splash of oil. Pile a little of the mixture on each pesto-smeared tart and top with two olives (if using)., Break up the mozzarella and place little bits on top of each tart – this will make it gooey like a pizza. Grate over some Parmesan (if using)., Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the cheese is all bubbly., Once the tarts are ready, allow to cool slightly. Sprinkle with the reserved basil leaves and serve with a nice salad for lunch."

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for 1 hour, until doubled in size., Tip out the proved dough onto a lightly floured surface. Cut it into eight, then roll them out into circular pizza bases about 5mm thick., To make the sauce, blanch the peas in boiling water for 3 minutes, then drain. Add them to a food processor, pick in the mint leaves, and add a lug of olive oil, season, then blitz to a paste., In a bowl, combine the goat’s cheese (or curd) with half the lemon juice and half the zest., Top each pizza with the pea purée. Grate and scatter over the courgette, then dollop on some of the goat’s cheese mixture., Sprinkle polenta over the pizza stone or preheated tray, then place the pizzas on top. Bake in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cooked 
and crispy at the edges., Season them, and serve with some watercress, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a grating of lemon zest."

In a separate bowl and cover the walnuts with water and place both bowls in the fridge to soak overnight., For the ‘spaghetti’, use a spiraliser to cut the courgettes into long curly strands or use a julienne peeler to slice into thin strips. Set aside., To make ‘parmesan’, blitz the cauliflower florets in a food processor until you have a grainy consistency. Place it on kitchen towel to soak up excess moisture while you prepare the rest of the dish., Place the garlic, rosemary and chilli in a food processor and blitz until finely chopped. Add the carrot, celery, red pepper and onion and 
blitz again until chunky., Drain and rinse the walnuts and add to the other ingredients in the processor with the beetroot, plum tomatoes, 150g of the cherry tomatoes, the lemon zest and juice, dates and sundried tomatoes (with their soaking liquid), parsley and half of the basil leaves. Quarter the remaining cherry tomatoes and set aside to garnish., Process the mixture until it forms a thick sauce and the walnut pieces resemble a minced texture. Depending how juicy your tomatoes are, you might need to thin it with a little extra water. Season to taste., To serve, divide the courgette ‘spaghetti’ between plates, pour over the sauce, sprinkle with the quartered tomatoes and cauliflower ‘parmesan’, then top with the remaining basil."

Add the stock cube and bring to the boil over a high heat, stirring to dissolve, then turn the heat down to low., Pick and reserve the basil leaves, then add the stalks to the pan of stock. Finely grate the Italian hard cheese., Once the vegetables are very soft but not browned, add the rice to the pan., Stir and fry the rice for 1 minute until translucent, then add the wine (if using) and keep stirring until it has been absorbed by the rice., Turn the heat under the rice up to medium, then add a ladleful of hot stock, avoiding the basil stalks – these are there to add flavour but not to be eaten!, Stir constantly and continue adding stock, a ladle at a time, waiting for the rice to soak it all up before adding the next ladleful. Continue until you’ve used two-thirds of the stock., Finely chop the basil leaves and the chilli (deseed the chilli if you prefer a milder heat)., Stir the chopped courgette into the stock, and keep adding it (courgette and all) until the rice is cooked and the risotto has a nice oozy consistency – if you run out of stock, use boiling water., Take the pan of risotto off the heat. Tear the mozzarella balls into pieces and stir into the pan with half the basil., Stir through half the grated Italian hard cheese, then season to taste with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Cover with a lid and allow to sit for two minutes., Divide the risotto between four plates, scatter over the remaining cheese, basil and the fresh chilli, then tuck in!"

Peel and slice the onions, and slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways, roughly 5mm thick., Peel and cut the squash into 5mm slices, then place on an oven tray, season and drizzle over 3 tablespoons of oil. Roast on the top shelf of the oven for 35 minutes, or until soft, adding the garlic and rosemary after 20 minutes., Put the whole peppers on a second tray and place on the lower shelf of the oven for 35 minutes, or until blackened. Tip them into a bowl, cover with clingfilm and set aside for 10 minutes., Peel and discard the skins of the peppers, deseed, then slice the flesh into large pieces. Season, then place in a colander to drain., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan over a medium heat and sweat the onions for 10 to 12 minutes, or until just caramelised. Stir in the balsamic and sugar and cook for another 5 minutes., Place a griddle pan over a medium-high heat. Brush the aubergine and courgette slices with oil and place on the hot griddle for 5 minutes, until soft and lightly charred (do this in batches). Turn and season them halfway through, then transfer to a plate. Set aside., Fill and boil the kettle. Put the spinach in a colander and pour over the boiling water to wilt it. Let it cool, then squeeze it dry, chop it up and pop it into a bowl., Add the ricotta to the spinach, then finely grate in the lemon zest and half the Parmesan. Season, stir to combine and set aside., Reduce the oven temperature to 180ºC/350°F/gas 4 and grease and flour a 23cm spring-form cake tin., On a floured surface, roll out 420g of the pastry, so it fits the base and sides of the tin. Carefully press the pastry into the tin, leaving a little overhang, and trim off any excess., Pick the basil leaves. Sprinkle half the basil and half of the remaining Parmesan over the pastry base, then layer up the veg. Begin with the courgettes and aubergines followed by a layer of the peppers, then the spinach. Spoon over the squash and onions, dot over pieces of the goat’s cheese, then scatter on the rest of the basil and Parmesan., Beat and brush the egg around the edge of the pie. Roll out the rest of the pastry, place it on top and crimp the edges with your fingers to seal. Poke a hole in the pastry top and brush with the beaten egg., Bake the pie in the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden, covering the top with kitchen foil for the last 10 minutes if it looks too dark., Leave the pie to cool in the tin on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then take it out of the tin to cool completely.

Slice the bacon, peel and finely chop the onions and garlic, then chop the carrots, celery and fennel. Pick the basil leaves, finely chopping the stalks., Heat a lug of oil in a pan over a medium-low heat, stir in the chopped ingredients and sauté gently for 15 to 20 minutes, or until everything is soft but not coloured., Halve and slice the courgettes lengthways. Core the cabbage or remove the tough stalky bits from the chard, then wash the leaves and finely slice., Add the wine to the softened veggies and bring to the boil. Tip in the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, then add the courgettes. Bring back to the boil, and simmer on a low heat for around 15 minutes., Mix in the cabbage or chard, the beans and their juice and the stock. Bring to the boil, then add the pasta. Simmer over a medium heat until the pasta is cooked (use the packet instructions as a guide) – if the soup is too thick, add a little stock or water to loosen., Season to taste, then rip in most of the basil leaves and dress with a few lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Stir well, and serve with the reserved basil and a fine grating of Parmesan."

   tinned chickpeas (drained weight)","Finely grate the courgette, trim and finely chop the spring onions and green chilli, then chop the pistachios. Pick and finely chop all the fresh herbs., Toast the cumin seeds in a dry pan until smelling fantastic. Meanwhile, lightly beat the egg., Mix all the kofte ingredients together in a large bowl, keeping some pistachios back to garnish, then season well., With wet hands, form 16 kofte, each the size and shape of a small egg. Leave in the fridge to firm up for at least 30 minutes, then thread onto metal skewers, two kofte on each., Cook the kofte under a grill or over a flame charcoal grill, on high for 12 minutes, until juicy, golden brown and cooked through, turning regularly., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., To make the chilli sauce, halve the tomatoes and onions (there's no need to peel), and bash the unpeeled garlic cloves., Place the red chillies, tomatoes, onions and garlic on a baking tray. Drizzle with oil and season, then roast for 25 minutes or until soft and slightly blackened., Allow to cool slightly, then carefully remove and discard the stalks from the chillies, the cores from the tomatoes and the skins from the onions and garlic., Add to a food processor, along with the sugar, tomato purée and vinegar. Blitz until smooth and add a lug of oil to make it glossy. Pulse again, then season., For the tahini yoghurt, mix all the ingredients in a bowl and season with a pinch each of sea salt and black pepper., To make the pilav, peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Add a lug of oil to a non-stick pan over a medium-low heat, then sweat the onion and garlic for 10 minutes. Add the bulgur and stir to coat., Pour in the stock, bring it to the boil, then turn down the heat to very low. Cover with a lid and steam the bulgur for 8 minutes., Meanwhile, in a separate pan, melt the butter and cook the vermicelli until the butter turns golden brown., After 8 minutes, add it to the bulgur along with the chickpeas – don’t stir at any point, just replace the cloth and lid and let it steam for another 8 minutes., Turn off the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes – you should end up with a beautifully light and fluffy pilav., Serve the kofte accompanied by the pilav, chilli sauce and tahini yoghurt, then finish scattered with the reserved pistachios."

Trim the aubergines and courgettes, deseed the peppers and chop into 2.5cm chunks. Roughly chop the tomatoes. Pick the basil leaves and set aside, then finely slice the stalks., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large casserole pan or saucepan over a medium heat, add the chopped aubergines, courgettes and peppers (you may need to do this in batches) and fry for around 5 minutes, or until golden and softened, but not cooked through. Spoon the cooked veg into a large bowl., To the pan, add the onion, garlic, basil stalks and thyme leaves with another drizzle of oil, if needed. Fry for 10 to 15 minutes, or until softened and golden., Return the cooked veg to the pan and stir in the fresh and tinned tomatoes, the balsamic and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Mix well, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Cover the pan and simmer over a low heat for 30 to 35 minutes, or until reduced, sticky and sweet., Tear in the basil leaves, finely grate in the lemon zest and adjust the seasoning, if needed.

Roast for around 1 hour, or until all the veg is soft, then tip into a large jug., Add a good splash of boiling water, then blitz with a stick blender to your desired consistency. At this stage, remove a portion for your baby, if needed (you can freeze in ice-cube trays for another day)., Place the remaining blitzed veg into a pan add the stock, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Add the pastina or break in the spaghetti/linguine, then stir through the soup, adding a splash more water to loosen if the soup is quite thick because the pasta will absorb the water., Place on the hob for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked through., Serve with good grating of Parmesan cheese (not for your baby, and only a little for toddlers)."

Add to the bowl with the aubergines and courgettes., Scrunch the tinned tomatoes in your hands and add to the bowl. Drizzle in the sherry vinegar and a little extra oil if desired.

Chop the courgettes into rough 2cm chunks and place in the bowl with the potatoes., Fill and boil the kettle., Once the vegetables are cooked, add the potatoes, courgettes and a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Crumble the stock cube (if using) into a measuring jug and carefully top up to 1.4 litres with boiling water and stir until dissolved. Carefully pour the hot stock into the pot., Turn the heat up to high and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until the potato is cooked through., Add the peas or beans and the spinach and cook for a further 4  minutes, or until the peas are tender., Carefully remove the pot to a heatproof surface and leave for a minute or two to stop bubbling., Carefully blitz with a stick blender until smooth (use a tea towel to protect your hands from little splashes). Have a taste and add a tiny pinch of salt and pepper if you think it needs it., Pick and roughly chop the mint leaves, discarding the stalks., Carefully ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle over the mint. Delicious served with homemade croutons (see tip below)."

Slice the courgette at an angle, roughly 1cm thick – you want the pieces to be about the same size and shape as the penne., Pick and chop the rosemary leaves, then slice the mackerel 1cm thick (removing the skin, if you like)., Put the onions and courgettes into a large frying pan on a medium heat with a lug of oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, stirring occasionally., After 5 minutes, add the rosemary and mackerel and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until nice and golden, tossing occasionally., Meanwhile, whisk the eggs and milk together, then finely grate in the Parmesan., Reserving a cupful of cooking water, drain the pasta and toss it into the mackerel pan., Take the pan off the heat for a few seconds and stir in a good splash of the reserved water to cool it down (this is really important, because if you add your eggs when the pan’s still screaming hot, the heat will simply scramble them – you want the sauce to be silky smooth)., Quickly pour in the egg mixture and shake and stir together until thickened, silky and evenly coated, then plate up and serve with an extra grating of Parmesan, a good pinch of pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, if you like."

won’t believe how tasty the courgettes get with this method of cooking – it really does take them to another level. You’ve got to find some Lincolnshire Poacher, it’s an amazing cheese made by the very talented Jones brothers, Simon and Tim (see www.lincolnshirepoachercheese.com). The pastry is rich and amazing, so embrace the fact that it’s really crumbly and will definitely break as you’re making it. I’m serving this with a lemony salad and sweet salt-baked shallots, which will get caramelized and gorgeous and pick up the seasoning from the bed of salt. This method is also a great one for beetroots, so if you like this, try that., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Blitz the flour and butter in a food processor with a pinch of salt and a few good pinches of pepper until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip on to a work surface, make a well in the centre and add 100ml of cold water. Gently mix until it starts to come together, then – most importantly for a short, crumbly pastry – have the confidence to only just press, pat and almost hug it together to form a rough scruffy ball. Please don’t be tempted to knead the dough or it won’t be short and crumbly. Pop it into a floured bowl, cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge to chill while you make the filling., Put a drizzle of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat and pick in the leaves from half the bunch of thyme. Add a few gratings of nutmeg, the zest of half the lemon, the sliced courgettes and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Cook gently (the courgettes will cook down and become easier to handle), stirring occasionally, for around 25 minutes. Then turn the heat down to low and cook for another 20 minutes, so the courgette mixture becomes dense and the flavours really intensify and sweeten. Allow to cool a little, finely chop and crumble in the cheese, then chop and add the mint leaves. Set aside., Halve the pastry and roll each half into a circle just under 1cm thick and slightly larger than the pie dish you’ve chosen (roughly 23cm diameter x 4cm deep). Don’t worry if the pastry breaks up – that’s normal. Just patch it. Roll one of the circles around the rolling pin and carefully unroll it over the pie dish. Gently press the pastry into the corners and sides of the dish, then spoon and spread all your courgette mixture into the dish. Carefully unroll the pastry lid over the top, then flour your thumb and forefinger and gently pinch and crimp the edges together. Trim off any excess pastry and brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg., Now simply throw the rock salt into a roasting tray with the shallots, still with their skins on, and a few thyme tips. Put the pie right at the bottom of the oven, with the tray of shallots above. Cook for 1 hour, or until the pie is golden, then allow to cool and serve with those soft roasted shallots., PS: All the leftover salt from baking the shallots can be bashed up and reused."

Place the pieces flat-side down on the barbecue and cook until golden brown., Wrap the aubergines and courgettes separately in double layers of foil with a good drizzle of olive oil, half the lemon juice, all of the zest and a good sprinkling of parsley (make parcels that look like Christmas crackers). Place them both on the cooler coals and, using long tongs, cover them completely with hot coals. Cook for 20 minutes until soft and slightly blackened. (Alternatively, brown the veg on a hot, dry griddle then cook the parcels in an oven preheated to 200°C/400°F/gas 6, for 20 minutes until soft)., Meanwhile, prick the chilli all over with a knife so it doesn’t explode. Blacken it on all sides over the barbecue (or directly over a gas hob) then wrap in clingfilm until cool. Peel, deseed and chop., Unwrap the foil parcels and place the veg on a board. Remove the stalk and skin from the aubergine, top and tail the courgettes, then chop the veg and add to a bowl. Dress with a lug of oil and the remaining lemon juice. Add the peeled and chopped garlic to the bowl, along with most of the chilli and mint. Toss and season., Lightly toast the ciabatta slices, then rub them with the cut sides of the remaining garlic clove. Drizzle with oil. Spoon over some of your lovely, smoky veg and sprinkle with chilli and mint."

Use a speed peeler to peel a courgette into ribbons. If you can get different colours of courgettes then having those colours together on the fork is a really nice touch. Take two ribbons in your hand and add a small chunk of feta cheese, a destoned green olive, a mint leaf and a tiny sprinkle of finely chopped fresh red chilli. Wrap everything up in the courgette ribbons then stab with a fork., Also try:

This will make the prawns look nicer and taste better, as they will take on more flavour., Get a wok or pan very hot while you very finely slice your baby courgettes at an angle. Place these in a bowl and have all your ingredients ready to go, which is really important when you're stir-frying., To your hot pan, add the oil, prawns, lime zest and ginger. Stir-fry for around 2 minutes, until the prawns are lightly golden., Remove from the heat, and allow to cool for 30 seconds before adding your courgettes, lime juice, chilli and herbs. You can increase or decrease the quantity of chilli to your own taste. I prefer to use lots!, Season with soy sauce and toss well, then serve on a plate. Eat straight away, while the courgettes are still nice and crunchy."

Place a griddle pan on a high heat to get it smoking hot. Using a speed peeler, slice your courgettes lengthways into lovely thin ribbons., Griddle your courgette slices until softened and lightly charred. You can do this in batches if your pan's not big enough to hold them all in one go. As they are so thin, don't worry about turning them over. Place in a bowl and add the drained beans, the chilli and mint., Rub your mackerel fillets with a little extra virgin olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Griddle them, skin side down, for 3 minutes until the skin is golden and crispy. Turn them over and cook for another 2 minutes., Dress the courgettes and beans with the juice of 1 lemon half, a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and some salt and pepper. Toss to coat everything in the dressing., Serve the mackerel fillets with a pile of the salad and a wedge of lemon to squeeze over the top., Tip: Try to find some yellow courgettes – they’ll look lovely alongside the green ones."

You may have difficulty getting hold of it, but if you can find it you’ll be using it all the time – it has an unusual flavour half-way between rice and couscous (this recipe will also work well with both of these). In Italy it was a major food for the ancient Romans, who used it to make bread, porridge and soup before they got hold of wheat. Nowadays it’s used in salads, soups, stews, even pastas. You should be able to buy farro in good Italian delis, and supermarkets have started to stock it in the special selection aisles. Here’s a recipe for one of my fave salads – give it a go., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Soak the farro or bulgar wheat in cold water for 20 minutes, then drain. Slice the courgettes across into chunky half-moons and put them into a large roasting tray. Add the remaining vegetables and the garlic cloves and toss together with a good splash of olive oil. Season with pepper and a tiny pinch of salt. Try to spread the vegetables out in one layer, as they’ll roast better this way (use 2 trays if you have to). Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, removing the trays and carefully shaking them now and then, until the vegetables are cooked through and crisp around the edges. Sprinkle a little vinegar over the vegetables as soon as they come out of the oven and set aside to cool. When cool, tip on to a large chopping board, add the fresh herbs and chop finely., Place the farro or bulgar wheat in a large saucepan, cover with fresh cold water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender, and drain well. Dress with olive oil and the lemon juice, season with salt and pepper, and toss with the roasted herby vegetables. Scatter over the reserved fennel tops and serve."

It's great because it's a nice little side dish that will go with things like mozzarella, goat's cheese, cured meats, grilled or barbecued white fish like cod or haddock, even things like chicken or pork. Use courgettes when at their best (nice and firm and not too big)., Slice 4 courgettes lengthways as thin as you can (use a mandolin if you have one). Grill on a red-hot griddle pan, or on the barbecue, until lightly charred on each side. Scatter the slices over a large plate, making sure you don't sit them on top of each other otherwise they'll steam and go a bit limp, and there's nothing worse than limp courgettes, I can tell you. While they're still warmish, sprinkle them with a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper., Deseed a red chilli and chop finely. Finely chop ½ a clove of garlic and sprinkle the chilli and garlic evenly from a height over the courgettes. (Add to your own taste, but just remember that when the chilli and garlic mix with the olive oil and lemon juice the heat and flavours are lessened.), Tear over a handful of fresh mint and drizzle with good extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon. I've even been known to throw in some blanched broad beans or raw peas if I can get any. This salad is always a real treat., P.S. If you find yourself with leftovers, try baking any fish fillets (cod, haddock or bass for example) on top of the courgettes. Lovely with steamed rice and seasoned yoghurt. Very fresh and good for you."

In this recipe, we're going to get nice thin escalopes of pork from the leg, flavour them and prepare them so they cook quickly. You could also use chicken or even veal in the same way, if you fancy.

Rub the goat's cheese with a little olive oil and cook on a hot griddle on both sides until nicely coloured. Remove and put to one side. Bash up the garlic and lemon thyme in a pestle and mortar (or use a metal bowl and the end of a rolling pin). Add a couple of splashes of olive oil, stir, and rub the mixture all over the pork escalopes., Season the pork then put the escalopes, one by one, between 2 large pieces of cling film and hit them with something heavy and flat until they're about 0.5cm thick. This will make them really tender. Do this to all 4 escalopes., Check that your griddle pan is hot, and chargrill your asparagus, then your courgettes, on both sides. Mark them nicely to give a bit of flavour and character to them. Put them into a salad bowl with the vinegar, 8 tablespoons of olive oil and half the fresh mint. Using the griddle pan again, chargrill your pork escalopes on both sides until nicely marked – about 4 minutes., Tear each escalope in half and scatter these into the salad bowl with the rest of the mint (for a lovely fresh burst of flavour) and the crumbled goat's cheese. Toss well, then place the bowl in the middle of the table and let everyone tuck in."

She inspired me to think of grilling as a really exciting way to prepare vegetables., Wash all your vegetables. Heat the barbecue or a griddle pan, put your whole peppers on it, and get them really black on all sides. While still hot, put them in a bowl, cover with cling film and leave to cool., Slice your courgettes lengthways about 0.5cm thick and do the same with your fennel, reserving the herby tops. Grill the courgette and fennel together on the griddle pan for about a minute on each side or until nicely charred. You don’t want them too black or too raw. Transfer to a clean tea towel in one layer, making sure they don’t sit on top of each other, otherwise they will steam and go soggy., Cut the aubergine across into slices 1cm inch thick. Every now and again you get an aubergine that is really seedy — if this happens, it will be bitter and no good, so throw it away and get yourself another one. Chargrill the aubergine slices, turning them 4 times until nicely marked, then transfer to the tea towel., Boil the baby leeks in salted water until they’re just cooked. Then drain, rub with a little olive oil, and chargrill them quickly until lightly marked., Peel the peppers but don’t hold them under the tap as all the sweet fantastic flavour will go down the drain. Carefully rub off the black skin, then remove the stalk and pips and tear the peppers up into large strips. Now put all the vegetables into a large bowl., Take about a quarter of your basil leaves and bash them in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of seasoning until you have a smooth pulp. Add about 8 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar, to taste. Pour this over the vegetables and toss quickly so that everything gets coated in the lovely basil oil, then throw in the remaining whole basil leaves. Slice the garlic really thinly to give you a delicate flavour and add to the bowl with the fennel tops. Mix everything together, and serve on a large plate at room temperature. Great with any grilled fish or meat, or as part of an antipasti plate with some toasted bruschetta and some fresh buffalo mozzarella."
