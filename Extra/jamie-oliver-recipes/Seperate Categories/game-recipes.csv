Sweet & sour rabbit | Jamie Oliver recipes,"Bay, almonds & pine nuts","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/77732376.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In1 hour,"“Nonna Marina uses bold ingredients and simple cooking methods to create big flavours. This recipe is inspired by a couple of delicious dishes that I was lucky enough to cook and enjoy with her, and I know you’re going to love it – it’s sticky, tender, and the unusual addition of nuts just works so well and adds a wonderful crunch. If you can’t find rabbit, a jointed chicken will work a treat with these flavours, too. ”",580,33g,6g,17.5g,0.3g,45.1g,19.7g,1g,"1                                                                                                                                                                whole                                                                                                                                                                rabbit (1.2kg)                                                                                                                                                                , skinned, jointed, with offal, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red onion, 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ripe cherry tomatoes, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    fresh red chilli, 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                    fresh bay leaves, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                pine nuts, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                blanched almonds, ½                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                ground cloves, 150                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                full-bodied Sicilian red wine, 100                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                thick balsamic vinegar, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                runny honey",

ginger, deseed the chillies, then slice it all with the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves). Place it all in a large ovenproof pan on a medium heat and char for 1 to 2 minutes to soften slightly., Tip into a large pestle and mortar, add the remaining paste ingredients and bash to a thick paste (or whiz in a food processor)., Return the pan to a medium heat. Halve the chicken legs through the bone, then place skin side down in the pan with the quail. Cut off and add the partridge and pheasant legs. Remove and discard the partridge and pheasant backbones, then halve the birds and add to the pan., Dry-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until everything is golden all over, then add the curry leaves and 1 heaped tablespoon of the paste. Leave to tick away on a low heat while you prep the aubergines, stirring regularly., Leaving the finger and round aubergines intact at the stalk, cut into quarters lengthways. Cut the large aubergine into thick rounds and slice down into the outer edge of each round to make a pocket. Use the remaining paste to stuff all the aubergines and coat their outsides., Layer into the pan on top of the game – it’ll be snug! Transfer to the oven to cook for 40 minutes, or until the aubergines are tender and the meat is cooked through., Put the pan back on a medium heat on the hob, then pour in the coconut milk and a splash of water. Let it gently bubble away for 2 minutes, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper and sprinkle over the coriander leaves. Delicious served with pickles, salad, rice and Fluffy coconut breads."

Strip the thyme and half the rosemary leaves into a pestle and mortar, then bash up with the bay, juniper berries, a pinch of sea salt and ½ a tablespoon of black pepper., Muddle in 6 tablespoons of oil, then rub all over the birds. Roast for 1 hour., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion, carrots and celery. Wash, trim and finely slice the white part of the leeks (save the green for making stock or soup) and the bacon. Peel the potatoes and cut into 2cm chunks., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large pan on a medium heat, add the bacon to render out the fat, then strip in the remaining rosemary. Once golden, add the onion, carrots, celery and leeks, then cook for 45 minutes on a medium-low heat, or until softened, stirring occasionally and adding the potatoes halfway through., For the pastry, put the flour and a good pinch of salt into a bowl with the suet, cube and add the butter, then use your thumbs and forefingers to rub the fat into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs., Beat the eggs, then, reserving just enough to eggwash the pie, stir into the bowl with 180ml of ice-cold water. Use your hands to gently bring it together into a ball, but don’t overwork it. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes., When the time’s up, remove the birds from the oven. When cool enough to handle, pick all the meat, discarding the skin and bones. Sieve the tray juices into the stock., Reduce the oven temperature to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3., Stir the flour into the veg for 1 minute, then pour in the cider and cook for 10 minutes, or until slightly reduced., Shred the meat and stir into the veg pan, then add the stock. Season well, bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes, or until thickened., Carefully drain the liquid through a coarse sieve into a pan, skimming away any fat from the surface. Leave to cool., Grease the bottom of a pie dish (25cm x 30cm) with a little oil. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry on a clean flour-dusted surface to ½cm thick and use it to line the pie dish., Stir 300ml of the strained gravy through the meat and spoon into the dish. Eggwash the edges., Roll out the remaining pastry to ½cm thick and a little bigger than the pie dish, then carefully place on top of the pie, trimming off any overhang. Pinch the edges to seal and make two small incisions in the centre for the steam to escape. Use any spare pastry to decorate the pie, if you like., Eggwash the top, then bake at the bottom of the oven for 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden and the pie is piping hot., To serve, reheat the remaining gravy, skimming off any fat from the surface, and serve alongside the pie. Delicious with creamy mashed potato and seasonal mustardy dressed greens."

then roughly slice the dried cranberries. Peel and finely slice the onion., Add the sage and cranberries to the pork meat, and crumble in the chestnuts. Season, then mix well and stuff into the cavities of each partridge, leaving enough space for the air to circulate around the filling., Roll any leftover stuffing into balls. Rub olive oil, sea salt and black pepper all over the birds, then drape the pancetta or bacon over the breasts. Top each bird with a sprig of thyme, securing everything with string., Put the partridges into the hot tray with a lug of ale and any stuffing balls, then cook for 15 to 18 minutes (depending on the size of your birds), then remove the partridges and stuffing to a warm plate, covering with foil and a tea towel – don’t wash the roasting tray though.

Meanwhile, put the lentils in a pan and cover with 2cm or so of water. Add the rosemary, remaining thyme, bay, unpeeled garlic cloves and the onion., Squeeze the cherry tomatoes into the pan, if you’ve got them. Bring to the boil, then turn down and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the lentils are soft but holding their shape – the time will vary according to the type of lentil, so check the packet instructions., At this point, you only want 1cm of water, so drain away any extra, then add a swig of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar., Fish out the herb sprigs and the garlic cloves. Squeeze the garlic flesh out of the skins and into the lentils. Mix up, then season to taste. Stir through the baby spinach, then put the lentils onto a platter.

Add the blueberry jam to the roasting tray and stir it into all the lovely bits from the bottom of the tray. Add a good swig of ale, then put the tray over a medium heat to thicken and reduce a little., Take the partridges from the plate and put them and the stuffing, on the lentils. When the sauce is sticky, dollop some yoghurt over the lentils and pour the sauce over everything. Serve right away."

Cook until softened, stirring occasionally., Add the paprika and rosemary leaves, season generously with sea salt and black pepper and stir well., Return the rabbit pieces to the pan, add the wine, cover with a folded piece of greaseproof paper and bring to the boil., Simmer for 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours, or until the rabbit is tender and the sauce has thickened.

Serve with crusty bread to mop up the sauce."

If you bought your rabbits from the supermarket, they will probably be pre-jointed, but they’ll also be farmed – tender but not so tasty)., Cut the shoulders and legs off, and cut them in halves at the elbows and knees. Turn each rabbit so its backbone is on the board. Put a knife across the body, below the ribcage, and whack the back of the knife with a rolling pin. If you’ve done it hard enough, you will have cut the rabbit in two., Do the same thing at the other end to chop the pelvis off. Throw away the rib cages and pelvises. You will be left with a rectangular bit of the rabbit’s back, about 10cm long. Chop that in half, across the spine, giving you 10 pieces from each rabbit., In a large mixing bowl, combine the mustard powder and flour with a few pinches of sea salt and black pepper. Toss all the rabbit pieces in the seasoning mix until well coated., Peel and halve the onions. Trim and chop the celery, then peel the carrots., Melt the butter in a large, shallow sauté pan over a medium heat. Add the rabbit and brown evenly on all sides, adding butter as required., Add the onions, celery, carrots and thyme, and cook gently until soft and fragrant., Pour over the ale, topping up with enough water to cover. Simmer gently for about 45 minutes, or until the meat is tender, adding water if the liquid gets low., Once cooked, simmer the liquid to thicken, and stir in the mustard before serving with crusty bread and a watercress salad."

Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/gas 6., Place the quail in a small roasting tin, pour over the marinade and roast for 20 to 30 minutes, basting occasionally with the marinade, until golden brown and cooked through – if you find the quail are browning unevenly, move them around in the tin during cooking., Just before they’re ready, sprinkle the za’atar over the quail and return them to the oven until done., Cut or tear the flatbread into wedges, then arrange on a large platter. Separate the little gem leaves and scatter on top along with the rocket leaves., Place the quail on the bread and lettuce, then drizzle over the remaining marinade from the roasting tin. Great with a green salad and crusty bread."

the knee., Cut off the breasts and wings in one piece, then chop in half. You’ll have 16 pheasant pieces in total. Reserve the carcass., In a bowl, mix the flour with a few pinches of sea salt and black pepper, and toss in the pheasant pieces to coat. Leave for a while so the flour sticks to the skin., Peel and chop the onions and carrots, then trim and chop the celery, reserving the peelings. Peel and halve the garlic., To make pheasant stock, chop the carcasses in half and put them in a saucepan with a third of the veg and garlic, and all the peelings., Add water to cover, and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 1 hour, skimming off any floating bits., Pass through a fine sieve, discarding the vegetables and peelings, then reserve., Melt the butter in a large sauté pan over a medium heat. Cut the bacon into lardons, then add to the pan with the floured pheasant pieces., Brown slowly on all sides, adding more butter as required., Add the remaining vegetables, garlic and bay leaves, and cook until soft and fragrant., Pour over the madeira and top up with stock to just cover the meat. Simmer gently for 45 minutes, adding stock if the liquid reduces., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., To make the chestnut dumplings, mix the ingredients in a bowl, crumbling in the chestnuts., Mix with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, then add a pinch of salt and pepper, and just enough cold water to bind everything., Dust your hands with flour and roll into about 25 Brussels sprout-sized balls., Pour the stew into an ovenproof pot. Drop in the dumplings, poking them under the surface of the stew., Cover tightly with a lid or tin foil and bake for 30 minutes, or until the dumplings are fluffy and have soaked up the liquid. Serve with braised red cabbage."

Add the toasted spices and crush with a good pinch of sea salt., Transfer to a large bowl. Peel and finely grate in the garlic and ginger., Cut the venison into 2cm to 4cm pieces, then add to the spices with the yoghurt. Mix everything together to coat, cover and leave to marinate., Peel and finely slice 6 onions, and roughly slice the other 3. Finely chop the chillies., Heat a little ghee or butter in a large saucepan on a medium-low heat and sauté the thick onion slices with the garam masala for 10 minutes, or until softened but not coloured. Spoon onto a plate and set aside., Add a little more ghee to the pan, add the chilli and the remaining onions; cook for 5 minutes until softened., Add the venison, with all the marinade from the bowl, and turn the heat up to high. Fry for 5 minutes., Chop and add the tomatoes, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for around 4 hours, stirring occasionally. After 2 to 3 hours, stir in the reserved onions and cook for another hour or so with the lid off, stirring occasionally., To finish, pick and stir through the coriander leaves. Serve with steamed rice, extra yoghurt, naan and mango chutney."

Continue pounding until well mixed., Spoon the butter onto a piece of greaseproof paper and tightly roll up into a log shape, twisting each end like a Christmas cracker to seal., Place it in the fridge and leave it to chill for at least 20 minutes to firm up., Lay the partridge breasts, smooth side down, on a chopping board, then make a small incision in the thick part of each fillet, making sure you don’t cut all the way through, to make a little pocket., Cut 4 knobs of garlic butter off the log (using about half of it) and stuff one in each pocket, then cover the incision with a flap of the fillet. Save the rest of the garlic butter for another day., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Scatter the flour on a plate with a good pinch of salt and black pepper, then whisk the eggs in a shallow bowl and place next to the flour. Put the breadcrumbs in a separate shallow bowl., Dip each partridge fillet in the flour (shaking off the excess), then in the egg (letting any extra run off), then coat in the breadcrumbs., Heat a lug of oil in a large ovenproof pan over a medium-high heat. Fry the partridge kyivs for a couple of minutes on each side, or until lightly golden., Transfer the pan to the oven and continue to cook the kyivs for 8 to 10 minutes, or until dark golden and cooked through., Serve straight away with lemon wedges and a crisp garden salad, if you like."

Place the rest of the stick in the cavity with the sage., Reserving the herby tops, trim and halve the fennel, then place in a large roasting tray with the whole, unpeeled onions and the remaining garlic cloves., Sit the chicken and duck on the top shelf of the oven, directly on the bars, with the fennel tray underneath., Turn the temperature down to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and cook for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and the juices run clear., Pick the leaves from the rosemary sprigs into the pestle and mortar, then bash and bruise with a good splash of oil. Season the pigeons, partridges and quails all over, then drizzle with the rosemary oil., Gently untwist the links between the sausages and push the meat along to make one giant sausage. Start curling one end in, then twirl the sausage round itself until you have one big spiral of sausage, poking in the bay leaves., Sharpen the ends of the rosemary sprigs, then use them to skewer and secure the sausages in place. Drizzle with oil., Once the chicken is cooked, remove to a plate, cover with tin foil and a clean tea towel, then leave to rest., Place the rest of the birds directly on the oven shelf next to the duck. Sit the sausage wheel on top of the veg in the tray, then cook it all for 30 minutes, or until the birds are tender and cooked through., Meanwhile, to make the gremolata, peel the garlic, finely chop with the parsley leaves, then place in a bowl with the reserved fennel tops. Finely grate over the lemon zest, add a squeeze of juice and mix well., Remove the cooked birds from the oven and leave to rest. Move the roasting tray to the top shelf for a further 15 minutes, or until the sausage is cooked through and golden., Meanwhile, bring 1.1 litres of water to the boil in a large pan, then gradually add the polenta, whisking continuously until combined. Continue to stir over the heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until oozy, thick and smooth., Transfer the cooked veggies and sausage wheel to a plate, then skim away and discard the fat from the tray. Place on a medium heat on the hob, stir in the flour for 1 minute, then pour in the Chianti. Scrape up all that goodness from the bottom of the tray, then add the plum tomatoes, any resting juices from the chicken and the stock., Bring to the boil, then simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened and reduced to a lovely gravy consistency., Stir the butter into the polenta and finely grate in the Parmesan, loosening with a little water, if needed. Season to taste., Carve up the birds and slice the sausage, squeeze the onions and garlic out of their skins, then serve it all up on a board with the polenta. Scatter over the gremolata and serve the gravy and some steamed greens on the side."

Flip and repeat on the other side., When they are brown all over, remove from the pan, add the carrot and onion, reduce the heat to low, pop on the lid and cook slowly for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally., Add the vinegar and wine, then reduce by half. Return the legs to the pan, skin-side up. Add the thyme and pour over the stock to almost cover. Bring to a simmer, pop on the lid and cook in the oven for 1½ hours, until you can pull the meat from the bone., Leave the dish in the oven but take off the lid so that the skin on the legs colours and crisps up, then remove from the oven, season and keep warm.  Reduce the oven to 100ºC/gas ¼., Place a heavy-based frying pan over a medium–high heat and colour the crown on all sides., Add the remaining butter, reduce the heat and continuously baste the birds. Once they’re golden and crispy, cook in the oven until the temperature in the thickest part of the breast reaches 59ºC. Carve and serve with seasonal veg."

the shallots and fry in the duck or goose fat on a low heat for 6 to 8 minutes, or until soft. Leave to cool., Cut the pork belly into 1cm cubes and halve the prunes. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Pick the thyme leaves until you have about a tablespoon and finely chop., In a bowl, mix all the ingredients for the filling except for the rabbit and season well. Cover with clingfilm and refrigerate until needed., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. For the pastry, mix the flour with 1 teaspoon of sea salt in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Melt the lard in a saucepan over a low heat, then pour in 200ml water and bring to the boil. Stir into the flour with a wooden spoon to form a smooth dough. Leave the pastry for 5 minutes if too hot to handle., Lightly grease a 20cm-wide, 10cm-deep pie ring and place it on a greaseproof paper-lined baking tray. Take two-thirds of the dough and roll into a circle large enough to line the pie ring and with excess to hang over the edges. Carefully press the pastry into the tin, allowing a little to hang over the edge, and fill any tears or breaks – this is important! Roll the remaining pastry into a circle for the lid., Lay half the filling mix in the pastry case, then lay the rabbit thighs on top, making sure there are no gaps. Season generously and fill the pie with the remaining filling. Brush the edges with the egg and cover with the pastry lid. Carefully crimp the edges to create a seal and trim the edge with a knife., Beat the egg and brush over the top of the pie, make a hole in the middle of the pastry lid and bake for 60 to 80 minutes., Remove the ring and brush the sides and top again with egg before baking for a further 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Once the pie is cold, refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours., For the jelly, soak the gelatine leaves in cold water until they soften and squeeze out any water. Heat about a third of the chicken stock in a saucepan and stir in the gelatine until it’s dissolved, then stir into the rest of the stock. Leave to cool, but do not let it set., Once the pie is cold, check around the pastry for any holes and fill them with softened butter so that the jelly doesn’t escape. Pour the stock into the round hole in the top of the pastry until the pie is filled. Cool in the fridge until the jelly is set."

Pop in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes., When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 120°C/250°F/gas ½., In a small bowl, mix the brown, Worcestershire and tomato sauces together – adding as much or as little of each as you like. Peel, finely chop and stir in the shallots, then set aside., Halve the buns, then pop them on a baking tray and warm in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes., Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a large non-stick pan over a medium-high heat and fry the burgers for about 4 minutes on each side, or until cooked through, seasoning well as you go., To build your burgers, spread the shallot sauce on the warm bun bases. Slice and add the crisp apple, followed by the burger and a nice piece of blue cheese. Finish with a pinch of watercress, then pop on the lids and serve immediately."

Toss the unpeeled shallots in the olive oil, season with sea salt and black pepper, and place them in a shallow baking dish with the thyme sprig. Cover tightly with foil and bake in the oven for 45 minutes or until soft., Meanwhile, preheat a heavy griddle pan that’s large enough to hold the venison comfortably. If your griddle pan is too small, cut the venison into 2 pieces and grill it in 2 batches., Remove all the fat and any sinew from the venison, season well, and brush with olive oil. Place on the hot griddle and sear and brown all over – about 2 to 3 minutes. Take out of the pan and place on a plate to cool for about 30 minutes., Mix the horseradish into the crème fraîche. Season it well with salt, pepper and the vinegar., Finely chop the rosemary and finely grate the zest of the orange., Thinly slice the venison with a sharp carving knife and lay 3 slices on each plate. Peel some of the warm shallots, tear them in half and lay a piece on top of each piece of venison.

The venison will cook to be delicious, tender and sumptuous. After all these years of cooking, a meal like this still gets my pulse racing. For a bit of a treat, use 500g of pastry and line the bottom of the pie dish - just make sure you cook it at the bottom of the oven so the pastry has a chance to crisp up.

a low heat. Peel and slice the onions and fry gently for about 10 minutes until nice and sweet. Don’t let them colour too much., Meanwhile, peel and chop the garlic and carrots, and trim and chop the celery., Turn the heat up, then add the butter, garlic, carrot and celery. Peel, roughly tear up and add the mushrooms. Mix everything together., Cut the venison into 2cm cubes, pick and chop the rosemary leaves and bash the juniper berries in a pestle and mortar. Stir in the venison, rosemary, bashed-up juniper berries and bay leaves. Pick in the thyme leaves and add a pinch of sea salt and 1 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper., Fry everything quickly for 3 or 4 minutes, then pour in the ale. Stir in the flour and add just enough water to cover. Bring to a simmer, pop the lid on and place in the oven for about 2½ hours, giving it a stir from time to time., The perfect pie filling should have tender meat in a rich, dark, thick stew. So if, when you remove it from the oven, it’s still quite liquidy, place the pan on the hob and reduce for 15 minutes or so until it thickens up a bit., Evenly roll out the pastry on a floured surface until it is the thickness of a pound coin. Tip the stew in the pie dish and place the pastry on top of the pie., Criss-cross the top of the pastry lightly with a sharp knife. Brush the top with beaten egg., Pop the pie on the bottom shelf of the oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the pastry is well cooked, puffed-up and golden – then tuck in and enjoy!"

lamb and mutton, but back in the day – at the right times of the year – they’d also get out there and hunt things like elk, which they’d stew with wild juniper berries. What’s amazing for me is that thousands of miles away in Britain we were hunting deer for venison and stewing that with juniper too. I guess some combos are just brilliant, no matter where you live. Don’t worry if you can’t get venison, because stewing beef will also be delicious. Really nice served with some rice, beans, a jacket potato or flatbreads, or, if you’re a bit more traditional, some nice steamed greens. A humble but delicious stew., Dust a chopping board with 2 tablespoons of flour and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and toss your chunks of meat through this mixture until well coated. Heat a large pan on a high heat, add a few lugs of olive oil and fry your meat for 3 minutes to brown it. Add your chopped onions, carrots, celery, crushed juniper berries, rosemary and the knob of butter. Add a few tablespoons of water, give everything a good stir, then pop the lid on the pan and let everything steam for 4 to 5 minutes so the flavours really mingle together., Take the lid off so your meat and veg start to fry, and stir every so often for 5 to 10 minutes. Chop your parsley stalks finely, and once the onions start to caramelize, add them to the pan with your remaining 2 tablespoons of flour and your crumbled stock cubes. Stir, and pour in enough water to cover the mixture by a couple of inches. Put the parsley leaves aside for later., Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to medium low so that the stew is just simmering. Add your potatoes and slow cook for at least 2 hours with the lid slightly askew, or until the meat falls apart easily. Keep an eye on it as it cooks, and add splashes of water if you think it looks too dry., Put your chopped garlic in the middle of a chopping board. Add most of your parsley leaves with a teaspoon of sea salt and half a teaspoon of black pepper. Chop everything together so you get a kinda chunky paste. Add this to the stew and stir through. Chop the last of your parsley leaves and sprinkle over before serving."

If you haven’t got a pestle and mortar, use the end of a rolling pin and a metal bowl. Loosen with 2 good lugs of olive oil. Pat the venison dry with some kitchen paper, and rub the oil mixture all over it. Sear the meat in a hot pan on all sides – roughly 6 minutes for medium rare, 7-8 minutes for medium, and you’d have to be a nutter if you wanted to cook it for any longer than that! Depending on the thickness of the meat and the heat of the pan, it may need a little less or more time to cook – so don’t look at the clock, look at the meat. This is the time when you want to try to be instinctive with your meat. Remove it from the pan when it’s cooked to your liking and allow it to rest on a plate for 4 minutes, covered with tinfoil., Reduce the heat under the pan and add a good lug of oil. Add the shallots and the garlic and fry gently for around 3 minutes until translucent and tender. Turn up the heat again, add the wine, and let it reduce by half. Add the blueberries and simmer slowly for 4 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat, add the butter, and jiggle and shake the pan around so the sauce goes slightly opaque and shiny. Season to taste., Slice the venison into 2cm/¾ inch slices and serve with steamed purple sprouting broccoli or some other good greens. Add the meat’s resting juices to the sauce and spoon over the venison. Absolutely fantastic."

If you cook it in the oven, turn the pieces of rabbit several times to ensure even colour and cooking. If you cook it on the barbecue, you’ll need 5 wooden or metal skewers (soak wooden ones before you use them). Whether barbecuing or roasting, here are your rough timings:, Belly: 25 to 30 minutes.
Kidneys and liver: 4 minutes.
Saddle and ribs: 15 to 20 minutes.
Legs and shoulder: 35 to 40 minutes., Put your rabbit pieces into a bowl. Using a pestle and mortar, or a liquidizer, bash or whiz up the thyme and rosemary leaves to a pulp, then add the garlic cloves and bash or whiz again. Stir in 8 tablespoons of olive oil, the lemon zest and juice and the honey, and pour this over the rabbit. Put the meat to one side and let it come to room temperature while you light your barbecue., Now I’m going to talk about flavour. Get a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme and tie them together like a little brush. Each time you turn the meat, dab it with a little of the marinade to give you a lovely encrusted layer of flavour. This rabbit is going to be really tasty!, Keeping the marinade to one side, remove the pieces of meat and season with salt and pepper. Sandwich the pancetta between the 2 pieces of belly using 3 skewers. Put the legs and shoulder on the barbecue. When they’ve been cooking for 10 minutes, put the belly on. After another 10 minutes put the saddle and ribs on. Make sure you turn the meat over every so often. Look after it by controlling the temperature and basting it continuously with the marinade. Cut three-quarters of the way through each kidney and open them out like a book. Cut the liver into 4 pieces and push one piece on to each remaining skewer, followed by a kidney and more liver., When all the pieces of meat are beautifully cooked, add your skewered bits of kidney and liver on to the barbecue and cook until golden, along with your 2 remaining slices of pancetta. After a few minutes, when the pancetta is browned, put it on top of the meat at the cooler end of the barbie. Now get your guests round the table., You can serve the rabbit with any white beans, or roast potatoes, or grilled vegetables, or different salads – it really depends on how you feel and what the weather’s like. Just put a big bowl of your chosen accompaniment in the middle of the table and serve all the meat on a board. Lovely with a glass of white wine. Simple, honest and bloody good."

In the past, I’ve seared pigeon breast, put it inside some lovely bread and had people tell me it’s the best steak sandwich they’ve ever had! So here’s how it’s done ... This makes a brilliant casual lunch, dinner or snack with a nice salad., Turn the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Put the onions into a large pan on a medium low heat and add a lug of olive oil, a pinch of sea salt and white pepper, the sugar and the thyme leaves. Put the lid on and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. After this time, remove the lid, turn the heat up to high and give the onions a good stir, then add the vinegar and stir again. Leave the lid off and continue to cook down until the onions are really sticky and slightly golden. Keep your eye on them., Put the ciabatta into the hot oven. Heat a large non-stick pan on a high heat. Finely chop the rosemary leaves and put them into a mixing bowl. Add the pigeon breasts, drizzle over some olive oil, season with salt and pepper and grate over a few scrapings of nutmeg. Toss the pigeon until coated. Once the pan is really hot, add a lug of olive oil and the bay leaves and put in the breasts, skin side down so they crisp up nicely. Cook for around 2½ minutes on the skin side and 1 minute on the other side for tender and blushing medium- rare meat, which trust me is what you want – anything over that and it will be tough and boring. As you remove the pan from the heat, shake in a few good drizzles of Worcestershire sauce, then toss the meat in the juices. Move to a board and slice thinly at an angle., Get the warm bread out of the oven, open it out with a serrated knife, put it on a nice board and spread as much mustard as you dare on one side (be confident – you can spread a little butter on if you want, but I don’t because the meat juices are enough). Put big pinches of watercress and those sticky onions down one side. Arrange the slices of pigeon around the sandwich, then dollop small amounts of cottage cheese in and around the meat. Push the top of the sandwich down and hold it for a couple of seconds so it sucks up all those juices. You can stab a knife through the sandwich to hold it together when you take it to the table.

the carrots and celery, and wash the onions (skin on). Roughly chop the bacon., Place the bacon in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, fry for a few minutes until golden, then add the bay, strip in the rosemary leaves, and put the rabbit and offal on top., Peel the white skin from the garlic, leaving the bulb whole, then drop into the pan with the leeks, carrots, celery and onions., Add the dried porcini, followed by the tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon as you go. Pour over the beer, add the tomato purée, and just enough water to cover everything (roughly 1 litre)., Bring to the boil, season generously with black pepper and a few pinches of sea salt, then finely grate in half the nutmeg. Cover with a lid, then place in the oven to tick away for 12 hours., When the time's up, let the stew cool down a little, then get yourself a big pair of clean Marigold gloves and another large pan. Pick through small handfuls of stew at a time, taking out any bones or vegetable skins. Discard the herbs, and flake the beautiful meat off the bones and into the clean pan. Scrunch the vegetables and offal in your hands as you go and break them into smaller pieces., Pour any juices left behind into the new pan, then go back in and have another rummage to make sure you haven’t missed anything. Season to perfection with salt and pepper., Finely grate in the lemon zest and pick in a few thyme tips to brighten up the sauce. Divvy the sauce up between sandwich bags and either freeze them, or keep in the fridge., To make rabbit bolognese, simply reheat a small ladle of sauce per person in a pan over a medium heat and cook around 75g of pasta per person. Cook the pasta in boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water., Toss the pasta with the sauce, loosening with a little cooking water, if needed, then grate in a good handful of cheese. Taste and season to perfection, then serve immediately with an extra grating of cheese, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some fresh thyme tips."
