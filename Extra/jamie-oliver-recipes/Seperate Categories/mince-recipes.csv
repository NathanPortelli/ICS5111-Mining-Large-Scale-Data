Stir them into the pan with the mince, breaking it up with your spoon. Cook for 15 minutes, or until golden and caramelized., Pour in the ale, let it cook away, then stir in the tomatoes and 1 tin’s worth of water, mashing it all with a potato masher. Simmer on a medium-low heat for 1 hour, mashing occasionally to thicken the texture. season to perfection., For 2 portions, either cut the lasagne sheets into 2cm slices or, for a bit of fun, stack up your sheets and cut 2cm slits into them at ½cm intervals all over., Cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for just 3 minutes, then scoop out and toss with 2 portions of Bolognese, loosening with a splash of pasta cooking water, if needed., Grate over the cheese, and serve right away.

a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat., For the burgers, trim, halve, wash and finely chop the leeks, then place in the frying pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Peel and finely chop or coarsely grate the carrot and add it to the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, stirring regularly. Tip onto a tray and spread it out to help it cool quickly., Put the minced beef, breadcrumbs, lentils (if using, see swaps below) and mustard in a large tray or bowl. Finely chop and add the gherkins and herb leaves., Once the veg is completely cool, add to the tray and use clean hands to mix and scrunch it all together well., Now, with wet hands, divide into 10 and shape into balls, patting them together well, but not packing them too tightly – there’s nothing worse than dense balls. Line them up on an oiled roasting tray as you go., Place the tray in the fridge for 1 hour, or until you’re ready to cook., Preheat the oven to 180CºC/350ºF/gas 4. Roast the burgers for 40 minutes, then pull out the tray and coarsely grate over the cheese. Return to the oven for a final 10 minutes, or until golden and bubbling., Meanwhile, for the salsa, run a sharp knife down the shaft of the corn cobs to remove the kernels. Sprinkle them into a dry non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat and let them char and catch for a few minutes, tossing occasionally., Put the oil and vinegar into a large bowl, squeeze in the lime juice and add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Finely chop and add the herb leaves and chilli, to your taste., Deseed the peppers, peel and core the pineapple, then finely chop with the tomatoes, adding them to the dressing as you go., Tip the hot, charred corn straight into the salsa mix and toss well. Crumble in the feta, then taste and check the seasoning, tweaking with more vinegar, if needed – you want it to be slightly more acidic than you think it should be., Serve the cheesy Botham burgers and tangy salsa with a simple green salad and some good spuds, whether jacket, wedged or roasted new potatoes, it’s all good."

bread into breadcrumbs, then add to the meat., Bash up the cumin seeds and dried chilli in a pestle and mortar, and pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves. Add to the mince with the dried oregano and egg yolk. Season well with sea salt and black pepper., At this stage you could add your optional ingredients (peeling and finely chopping the onion and garlic first, then cooked together gently in 1 tablespoon of oil until tender and allowed to cool)., Mix well, and, with wet hands, roll and pat into meatballs the size and shape you want (cook straight away or put on greaseproof paper and refrigerated for up to a day.), Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6 and heat a thick-bottomed casserole pan on the hob., Swirl 4 tablespoons of oil around the pan and add your meatballs. Fry until brown all over, being careful not to break them up., Turn the heat down and cover with the Basic tomato sauce, pick the basil leaves and tear in fresh basil, tear over the mozzarella and finely grate over the Parmesan., Cook in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden."

cloves of garlic. Cut the green part off the leeks (save for making stock or soup), then trim, wash and finely chop the white part. Peel the potatoes and chop into ½cm dice. Tie the thyme sprigs together., Melt half the butter in a large pan on a low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, then add the onions, garlic, celery, leeks, potatoes, bay leaves and thyme. Cover and sweat down for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Add all the mince to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Turn the heat up to medium-high and cook for 10 more minutes, or until the mince is browned all over, stirring occasionally., Pour in the wine, let it bubble and boil away, then finely grate in half the nutmeg. Stir in the flour for 1 minute, then pour in the milk. Season with sea salt and black pepper, cover with a scrunched-up sheet of wet greaseproof paper and transfer to the oven for 2 hours, or until thickened and beautifully tender., At this stage, the ragù might look like it’s split a little, but this is actually what we’re looking for – the milk in the sauce creates amazing ricotta-like curds as it cooks., Meanwhile, place a large heatproof baking dish on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil and the remaining butter. Peel, finely chop and add the remaining garlic, along with the chilli flakes, nettles (leaves only – wear gloves to protect your hands while you prep) and spinach – you’ll need to work in batches. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened., Allow to cool, then finely chop and return to the dish, spreading evenly over the base. Once done, divide the ragù in two, freezing one half for another day, once cool., Carefully drain the liquid from the remaining ragù into a bowl through a coarse sieve. Return the ragù to the pan, fish out and discard the thyme stalks and bay, then grate in half the cheese and stir well., Turn the oven up to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Use a piping bag or teaspoon to stuff the cannelloni tubes with the ragù, then arrange on top of the greens. Pour the sieved liquid over the top and grate over the remaining cheese. Trim and finely slice the mushrooms and scatter over the cannelloni., Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, then bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. For added colour, flash the dish under the grill for 5 minutes. Importantly, let it stand for 30 minutes before serving. Delicious with a seasonal salad for added crunch."

The addition of chickpea flour gives an extra crumbly-ness to this pastry and the turmeric adds a pop of colour and extra spice. You will need to make the filling in advance, so that it's cooled when you make your pies, otherwise the heat will soften the pastry.

Peel and finely chop the onion and cook over a medium heat until soft but not coloured. Peel, crush and add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute., Add all of the spices and dried herbs to the pan, then cook for another 30 seconds until aromatic., Add the lamb mince and cook over a high heat until browned all over. Add the tomato purée, cook for 1 minute, then tip in the tinned tomatoes, stock and sugar, breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon., Season with sea salt and black pepper, stir to combine and cook over a medium-low heat for about 30 minutes, or until the lamb is tender, the sauce has thickened and almost all of the liquid has evaporated., Remove the pan from the heat. Pick and finely chop the mint leaves, then add along with the chickpeas and pine nuts, then season to taste and leave to cool., To make the pastry, sift both flours into a bowl, then add the turmeric and 3 teaspoons of salt. Dice the butter and rub into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs., Combine the vinegar with 180ml of iced water and make a well in the middle of the flour mixture. Add three-quarters of the vinegar water and mix with a knife until the dough starts to come together, adding the rest of the liquid, if needed., Very lightly knead the dough until smooth, flatten into a disc, wrap in clingfilm and chill for at least 20 minutes., Divide the pastry into 15 even pieces and roll out each one on a lightly floured work surface to a thickness of about 3mm. Cut the pastry into 12 to 13cm discs using a saucer or small bowl as a guide., Lay the pastry discs on a work surface and add a heaped tablespoon of the lamb mixture to each pasty. Brush the edges with water and fold the pastry over to make neat semi-circles. Pinch the edges together and crimp between your fingers., Arrange the pies on a baking tray. Beat the egg with the milk, then  brush over the top and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Brush the pasties with more egg wash, sprinkle with the za’tar and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pastry is cooked and the filling is hot through."

water, then leave to soak for about 15 minutes., Mix the seven-spice ingredients together (it’ll make more than you need, but save the rest in an airtight jar for another day)., For the filling, finely chop the walnuts, destone and roughly chop the dates, and finely chop the top leafy half of the parsley., Place a large frying pan on a high heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil, the minced lamb, pine nuts and walnuts. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until starting to crisp up, stirring occasionally., Add 2 teaspoons of the seven-spice and the dried herbs, then cook for a further 5 minutes, or until dark golden and gnarly. Leave to cool, then stir through the chopped parsley., Drain the bulgur (if needed), and mix with the remaining kibbeh dough ingredients and a good pinch of sea salt until it comes together – this will become your outer layer., Divide the mixture into 16 balls (roughly 50g each). Place one ball on the palm of your hand, then press and flatten into an oval shape, roughly 7cm x 8cm. Place a good pinch of cooled filling into the centre, then mould the dough up and around the filling to seal., Repeat with the remaining ingredients, then place in the fridge to firm up for around 30 minutes. Now’s a good time to get on with making the Amba sauce and Houmous., When you’re ready to cook, just under half fill a large sturdy pan with oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go., Carefully lower one kibbeh into the pan – after 3½ to 4 minutes it should be golden and perfectly cooked through, so take it out of the pan and cut it in half to check your timings – once you know where you stand, you can cook the rest, in batches., Serve the kibbeh with the houmous and amba sauce. It’s also good with pickled veg, flatbreads and a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds and fresh herbs."

Once golden, stir in 1kg of minced beef, breaking it up with a wooden spoon., Drain and add 2 x 400g tins of beans, pick, finely chop and add the leaves from 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary, along with 2 fresh bay leaves, then cook it all for 20 minutes, or until dark golden, stirring regularly. Any time it starts to catch at the bottom of the pan, simply add a splash of red wine (if using) or water to pick up all those nice, sticky bits., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Peel 2 large onions and 2 large carrots, trim 1 celery heart, then finely chop it all (by hand or in a food processor). Stir into the pan and cook for another 15 minutes., Tip the contents of the sun-dried tomato jar (280g) into a blender, add 2 tablespoons of balsamic and blitz until smooth. Stir 2 tablespoons into the pan, then decant the rest back into the jar, popping it into the fridge for another day – it will be delicious brushed on to meat, fish or veg before roasting or grilling, or used on crostini., Pour 2 x 400g tins of plum tomatoes into the pan, along with 2 tins’ worth of water. Mix well, bring to the boil, then pop into the oven uncovered for 1 hour, or until thick and reduced., Taste, season to perfection, and cool.

If you're cooking it now, place the meatloaf in a casserole-type pan or baking dish, then pop in the hot oven., Immediately reduce the temperature to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6 and cook for 30 minutes., Meanwhile, for the sauce, peel and chop the onion into 1cm dice, then peel and finely slice the garlic along with the chilli., Place in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of oil, the paprika and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Cook for around 7 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden, stirring every 30 seconds or so., Drain and add the chickpeas, along with the Worcestershire sauce, tomatoes and balsamic vinegar., Bring to the boil, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Taste the sauce and season if needed., To finish, pick the rosemary leaves into a bowl. Remove the meatloaf from the oven and pour all the fat from the pan over the rosemary, mixing well., Spoon your sauce around the meatloaf, lay the slices of bacon or pancetta over the top and scatter over the rosemary leaves. Put the pan back in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the bacon turns golden and the sauce is bubbling and delicious., Delicious served with a mixed-leaf salad and lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Sprinkle over the bicarbonate of soda and paprika, and season., Crack in the egg and use your hands to scrunch everything together. Add as much of the sparkling water as you need to make a smooth, pliable mixture., Divide the meat into 10 to 12 pieces and roll each one into a sausage shape, about 10cm long and 2cm thick. Place the cevapi on an oiled baking tray, cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge until needed., For the ajvar, preheat the oven to 230ºC/450ºF/gas 8., Place the whole peppers and aubergines on a large roasting tray along with the unpeeled garlic bulb and roast in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the veg skins are blackened, turning halfway through., Place the charred peppers and aubergines in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave for 20 minutes, to steam off the skins. Once they’ve cooled slightly, pull off and discard the skins, seeds and stalks and chop the flesh on a board., Squeeze out the garlic from 6 of the roasted cloves and add it to the veg along with most of the parsley, then chop it all together (if you have much roasted garlic leftover, stir it into softened butter and store in the fridge – it’s great for garlic bread!)., Keep chopping everything together, season with sea salt and black pepper, squeeze over the juice of 1 of the lemons and drizzle over a good lug of oil. Adjust the seasoning to taste, then set aside., Finely chop the remaining parsley and tip into a bowl. Peel, finely chop and add the onion, squeeze over the juice from the remaining lemon, then mix together. Set aside., Just before you’re ready to serve, warm your flatbreads in the oven, and preheat a griddle pan over a high heat.

1 teaspoon of sea salt. Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Finely slice the carrots in a mandolin. Remove the pan from the heat, tip in the carrots and stir to coat. Leave to cool completely, then let pickle for at least 30 minutes., Heat 1 tablespoon of the groundnut oil in a wok until smoking hot. Add the minced pork, season with the white pepper and a pinch of salt, then toss until golden and starting to crisp., Finely slice the spring onions. Add 2 of the chopped spring onions to the pan with the red thai paste and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the stock, and turn down the heat, cooking for a further 20 minutes, or until the stock has evaporated and the pork is tender, cooked and starting to crisp up again., In a separate pan, heat the rest of the groundnut oil. Add the cube of bread; if it browns in 10 seconds, your oil is hot enough to start frying. Pick the basil leaves, discarding the stalks. In batches, fry the basil leaves for 3 seconds, until they’re translucent and crisp (careful of the hot oil, as it may spit). Remove the crispy leaves with a slotted spoon and leave aside to dry on kitchen paper., To serve, separate out and place the lettuce leaves on a serving plate, scatter over the pork, pickled carrots, reserved spring onion and the crispy basil leaves. Drizzle with a little of the carrots’ pickling liquid and serve immediately."

                            , for grating","Strip and finely chop the rosemary leaves and finely chop the bacon., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large casserole pan on a high heat. Once hot, add the rosemary and bacon and fry for 2 minutes, or until the bacon starts to crisp up, stirring regularly., Add all the minced meat, using a wooden spoon to break it up as you go. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for at least 10 minutes, or until all the liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally., Place the coarse grater attachment in your food processor (or you could use a box grater instead) and grate the Cheddar, then tip into a bowl., Replace the grater with the regular blade. Trim and halve the carrots, then add to the processor and blitz to roughly the same size as the mince. Peel and halve the onions, add them to the carrot and blitz again., Tip into the pan with the mince while you get on with blitzing and adding the celery. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the vegetables start to soften, stirring regularly., Next, add the tomato purée and plum tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon. Fill each of the tins with water and tip into the pan.
Give everything a good stir and reduce the heat to low. Leave to simmer around 2 hours, or until thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally., While that ticks away, make your white sauce. Trim, wash and finely slice the leeks, then add to a pan along with 2 tablespoons of oil and the bay leaves. Stir well and season with a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Reduce the heat to low and cook for 30 minutes, or until sweet and softened, adding splashes of water, if needed., Add the flour and stir well to coat, then gradually add the milk, stirring continuously. Turn the heat up to medium, bring to the boil, then reduce to low and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened, stirring regularly., Carefully transfer the sauce to the food processor and blitz until smooth and silky. Add half the grated cheese and finely grate over half the nutmeg and mix well. Season to taste., Once the ragù is ready, preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Season the ragù to taste, then transfer half into freezer bags, portioning up as appropriate for your family. Allow to cool to room temperature, then pop in the freezer for another day. It’s a good idea to freeze them flat so that you can reheat them quickly and easily. It’s also a good idea to label and date them to avoid a game of freezer roulette in a few weeks' time!, To build your lasagne, spoon a quarter of the ragù into a large deep ovenproof dish (roughly 25cm by 30cm) and spread it out evenly., Spoon over a quarter of the white sauce, then snap over some lasagne sheets, making sure they completely cover the sauce in one layer. Repeat this 3 times, finishing with a layer of white sauce., Sprinkle over the remaining cheese and bake the lasagne in the oven for 45 minutes or until golden and bubbling., Remove the lasagne from the oven and leave to sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Delicious served with a fresh green salad."

trim, peel and finely chop the onions, garlic, carrots and celery, then clean and roughly chop the mushrooms., Pick the thyme and basil leaves, finely chopping the basil stalks, then finely slice the bacon., Heat a good lug of oil in a large casserole pan over a medium heat, add the bacon and fry until golden, then add the onions, garlic, carrots, celery, mushrooms and thyme and cook for around 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly coloured, stirring regularly., Add the minced meat, tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, and 1 tin’s worth of of water., Pour in the wine, then add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper and the basil stalks. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer with a lid ajar for around 1 hour, stirring occasionally., When the time’s up, remove the lid, turn the heat to high and cook for a further 20 to 30 minutes, or until thickened and reduced, stirring regularly and adding splashes of water, if needed., Meanwhile, fill a large pan with boiling salted water, add a drizzle of oil, then blanch your pasta sheets for 3 to 4 minutes – it’s best to cook them in batches. Drain, then carefully pat dry with kitchen paper and put aside until needed., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., For the white sauce, peel and finely slice the onion, then place in a pan over a medium heat with the milk, parsley, a few scrapings of nutmeg and the peppercorns. Gently bring to the boil, then strain into a jug., Melt the butter in pan over a medium-low heat, then mix in the flour adding and stirring in 1 splash of milk at a time until you have a smooth white sauce. Bring to the boil, then simmer for a couple of minutes before removing from the heat. Finely grate and stir through most of the Parmesan, then season to taste., When the time’s up, remove the Bolognese from the heat, tear in and stir through the basil leaves and season to taste, if needed., To assemble the lasagne, spoon a third of the Bolognese into the bottom of an ovenproof dish (25cm x 30cm), then follow with a layer of lasagne sheets and a third of your white sauce. Add another layer of Bolognese and repeat the process twice more, finishing with a layer of white sauce., Finely grate over the remaining Parmesan, drizzle with oil, cover loosely with tin foil and place in the oven for 20 minutes., Remove the tin foil and cook for a further 30 minutes on the grill/fan setting (at the same temperature), or until golden brown and bubbling at the edges. Delicious served with a seasonal green salad."

I decided to do a bit of reinventing on the classic mince pie, so in this recipe I’m using a combination of puff and filo pastry, both of which you can buy ready-made in the shops for extra convenience., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400ºF/gas 6. Scoop the mincemeat into a mixing bowl and mix in the dried berries, the clementine zest and the sherry or brandy., Dust a clean work surface with flour and roll out the puff pastry into a big rectangle about 20cm x 40cm and the thickness of a pound coin. Thinly spread the mincemeat over the pastry, leaving a 1cm gap around the edges. Tightly roll up the pastry, lengthways, like a Swiss roll, place it on a floured tray, and pop in the fridge to firm up., Take two cupcake trays (for 12 cupcakes each) and butter each one lightly with the melted butter. Place one layer of filo pastry over the tray (you may need more than one sheet to cover each tray depending on the size of the sheets) and ease the pastry into each hole. Brush with the melted butter, then cover with a second layer of filo pastry. Brush with butter again., Take the puff pastry roll out of the fridge and, with a sharp knife, cut it into 24 slices. Place each slice, flat-side down, into a filo-lined hole. Brush with the egg and sprinkle a few flaked almonds on top of each little pie, then pop both trays in the oven for about 25 minutes, until cooked and golden brown., Leave to cool, then crack the individual pies out of the trays. Dust with a little icing sugar before serving., PS You can freeze the cooked, cooled mince pies in their trays (just wrap the lot in cling film) or in a plastic container. Just reheat them in a hot oven straight from the freezer."

Dust a clean work surface and rolling pin with flour, and roll out the pastry until it is a little thicker than a £1 coin – about 4mm thick. Carefully cut out 10 circles of pastry large enough to line 7–8cm individual fluted tart tins. (Alternatively, cut out smaller circles and line a 12-hole bun tray.), Spoon the mincemeat into the pastries and bake for 20 minutes, until cooked through and golden, and the mincemeat is bubbling hot. Set aside on a wire rack to cool completely., In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites with 1 tablespoon of caster sugar until it thickens and you have stiff peaks. Gradually whisk in the rest of the sugar and keep whisking for a few more minutes until the meringue turns thick and glossy., Cover each mince pie with a shallow scoop of ice cream and then top with a dollop of meringue. Fork the meringue up a bit so it gets little peaks all over it, then brown briefly under a hot grill before serving."
