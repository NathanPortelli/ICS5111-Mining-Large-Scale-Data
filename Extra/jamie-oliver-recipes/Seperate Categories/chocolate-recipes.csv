I’m using up leftover panettone instead of making a sponge, and whipping together a cheat’s chocolate custard. It’s ridiculously retro and I absolutely love it. ”",535,35.5g,19.2g,43.4g,0.2g,6.4g,49.4g,1.6g,"3 x 425                                                                                                                                                                g tins of                                                                                                                                                                cherries in syrup, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dark chocolate                                                                                                                                                                , (70% cocoa solids), 4                                                                                                                                                                leaves of                                                                                                                                                                gelatine, 3 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tins of                                                                                                                                                                custard, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                hazelnuts, 600                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                double cream, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                vanilla bean paste, 1                                                                                                                                                                heaped tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                icing sugar, 3 x 1                                                                                                                                                                cm slices of                                                                                                                                                                panettone","Drain the cherries through a sieve into a measuring jug, topping up with cold water to make a pint (568ml), if needed. Pour into a medium pan and place on a medium heat. Transfer the cherries to a bowl., To make the chocolate curls, lay the unwrapped chocolate on the work surface, flat side up. Carefully drag a chef’s knife towards you, from top to bottom. Repeat until you have 6 to 8 good curls. Transfer the curls to a plate, and leave in the fridge until you’re ready to decorate., Snap the remaining chocolate into a heatproof bowl, add a pinch of sea salt and place over the pan of the cherry liquor, until melted., Snap 4 gelatine leaves into a small bowl, cover with cold water, and set aside to dissolve., Remove the bowl of chocolate from the heat, pour in the custard and mix until completely combined., Whisk the gelatine into the cherry juice until dissolved, then pour into the trifle dish. Scatter in a handful of the cherries and leave to cool, then place in the fridge for 4 hours until set., Toast the hazelnuts in a dry pan for 5 minutes, until golden. Tip into a pestle and mortar and bash to crumbs., Pour the cream into a large mixing bowl, add the vanilla bean paste and sugar, and whisk to soft peaks., Next, layer up the trifle. Spoon over ⅓ of the chocolate custard, spreading out with a spatula, and then top with 1 slice of panettone. Dot cherries over the panettone and drizzle with a little of the juice from the bottom of the bowl., Repeat with a layer of cream, chocolate custard, panettone, and cherries and syrup until you have 3 x each layer. Pipe over a final layer of cream (or you can just spoon it on, if you prefer)., Sprinkle over the chocolate curls, scatter over the hazelnut crumbs and take to the table."

Highly sophisticated chocolate chip cookies | Jamie Oliver recipes,"With rosemary, pecans & other fun things","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/129244398.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Makes', '12']",,"“I expect a lot out of a chocolate chip cookie. Not only does it have to be vegan, I’m also looking for a handful of characteristics. Crispy and crunchy while also chewy. Salty yet not too sweet. The perfect amount of chocolate and butteriness. All the while with a depth of flavour. That’s precisely why this recipe was created. Now, it may not be for everyone. And that’s okay. There are loads of plain, basic
chocolate chip cookie recipes out there. This isn’t one of them. Fresh rosemary, black pepper, and Nutmeg amuse the tongue; while coconut sugar, molasses, and flaxseeds provide the perfect chew. Toasted pecans and oat flour provide a subtle nuttiness. A sprinkling of flaked Maldon salt pushes these cookies over the top, in the best way possible. All in all, these are my go to chocolate chip cookies. They’re a bit more on the savoury side and, well, highly sophisticated. ”",,,,,,,,,"1

Add the milk and flaxseed meal and beat for another 30 seconds. Mix in the molasses, vanilla, and almond extract. Set aside., In a separate bowl, combine the flours, baking soda, and salt. Mix well. In small amounts, slowly add this mixture to the wet mixture, mixing constantly until it forms a dough. Fold in the pecans. Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes to chill., Using an ice cream scoop or spoon, scoop about 2 tablespoons of dough for each cookie onto the baking sheets, leaving a few inches between them. They will spread out as they bake., Arrange the chocolate chunks on top of each mound of dough and press them down gently. Sprinkle with the Maldon salt and vanilla sugar. Bake until the edges are golden brown, but not burned, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack for another 5 minutes."

Remove the pan from the heat, keeping the bowl over the pan., Meanwhile, halve and destone the avocados and scoop out the flesh into a food processor. (Try to remove as much of the flesh as possible, but a little left in the shell is fine)., You’ll now have four empty avocado skin halves. Using a clean pastry brush, brush the inside of the avocado shells with a layer of melted chocolate until evenly covered. Transfer to a tray and place in the fridge for 10 minutes until set. Repeat this process two more times, until you’ve applied three layers of chocolate. Return the tray to the fridge for half an hour, or until set completely., Meanwhile, place the pan and bowl back on a low-medium heat, snap in the remaining dark chocolate and leave to melt., Once melted, add the chocolate to the food processor with the cocoa powder, vanilla bean paste, maple syrup, coconut cream and a pinch of salt, and pulse for a few seconds to combine. Scrape down the sides with a spatula, then pulse again, until smooth. Scrape into a bowl, cover and leave in the fridge until needed (but no longer than 2 hours)., Once the chocolate shells are set, gently peel the avocado skins away from the shells and discard. Heat a tablespoon in a jug of boiling water for a few seconds., Now it’s time to get a bit creative with your presentation: using the hot spoon, roll up 1 tablespoon of the chocolate mousse for each serving plate (you will end up with about half of the chocolate mixture leftover, please see tip below). Press the chocolate shells onto the mousse, filling each with a little fruit (I used halved strawberries and blueberries, orange segments and a couple of amarena cherries). Drizzle with a little of the cherry liquor, and some melted and grated white chocolate to finish, if you like."

Crack the eggs into a shallow bowl, add the vanilla and cinnamon then whisk together with a fork., Soak the bread slices in the egg mixture for a couple of minutes, turning halfway., Place a large dry frying pan on a medium heat and toast the hazelnuts until golden, then tip into a pestle and mortar and bash until fine., Return the pan to the heat with the butter (or 1 teaspoon of oil). Once hot, carefully place one egg-soaked slice into the pan and break over the chocolate. Place the remaining slice on top and sandwich together., Add the banana slices to the pan and cook, without moving, for 2 minutes, until lightly golden., Use a spatula to carefully flip the bread and banana slices and cook for a further 2 minutes, until light golden on both sides., Lightly dust the top of the sandwich with the icing sugar and flip back over for a few seconds to caramelise., Carefully slide the sandwich onto a board (the caramel will be very hot!), cut in half diagonally, then transfer to a plate., To serve, place half a sandwich on each plate, top with 2 pieces of caramelised banana and a dollop of yoghurt, and finish with a good dusting of crushed hazelnuts."

and line a 25cm x 35cm baking tray with greaseproof paper., To make the sponge, first separate the eggs. Then, using an electric mixer, whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks with a pinch of sea salt. Gradually whisk in the icing sugar, then, one-by-one, whisk in the egg yolks until really pale and light. Sift in the flour and cocoa powder, add the vanilla bean paste, then fold everything together with a large metal spoon, so you keep in as much air as possible., Spoon the batter into the lined tray, then gently and evenly spread it out. Scatter the hazelnuts on a separate tray and bake both for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the sponge is just cooked through and springy to the touch., While it’s still hot and soft, turn out the sponge onto a large sheet of greaseproof paper (35cm x 45cm) on a flat surface. Peel off and discard the baked piece of greaseproof. With one of the longest sides in front of you, fold over the excess paper, then roll up the sponge with the paper inside (as it cools, this will set the shape but prevent the sponge from cracking). Leave to cool., Meanwhile, melt the chocolate and butter for the hazelnut spread with a big pinch of sea salt in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water., Once cool, blitz most of the toasted hazelnuts to a completely smooth paste, then mix into the melted chocolate and butter. Put one half of the mixture into a jar for another day (see tip), pour the remainder into a tin or bowl, then pop both into the fridge for 2 hours to set., For the filling, whisk the cream and icing sugar to soft peaks. To assemble, unroll the sponge so it’s flat, removing the paper. Spread the hazelnut chocolate spread all over and up to the edges, then repeat with the cream. Along one long edge, dot on the cherries and drizzle over a tablespoon of the juices from the jar, then grate on the clementine zest. Re-roll the sponge and pop into the fridge., Meanwhile, make your buttercream. Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water, then remove and leave to cool. Beat the butter in an electric mixer until pale, then, with the mixer still running, gradually add the icing sugar and cooled melted chocolate., Take the log out of the fridge, chop off a quarter at an angle – that’s the branch – and position it on your serving board like in the picture, using a splodge of buttercream to keep it in place. Evenly cover the whole log with buttercream, then use a fork to decorate it. Blitz up the reserved hazelnuts and dust them on top, along with some desiccated coconut, then decorate with plastic Bambi figures, whatever you like – go to town!"

Add all the sauce ingredients to a saucepan and melt together slowly over a low heat, stirring continuously. Once melted, pour straight into the bottom of the basin and allow to cool slightly., Cream the butter and sugar together in a stand mixer, or with an electric whisk, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Add the remaining ingredients and whisk for a further 5 minutes until smooth and well combined., Carefully spoon the mixture into the basin, over the cooled chocolate sauce, then gently spread out evenly so all the chocolate sauce is covered. Tear off a large piece of both kitchen foil and greaseproof paper (about an arm’s length) then lay both pieces over the pudding, greaseproof paper down, scrunching around the edges of the basin to seal tightly., Place the pudding basin into a large, deep roasting tin and fill the pan halfway with boiling water. Place the pan over a high heat and bring to the boil, then cover with foil, turn the heat down to low and leave to steam for 2 hours, topping up with more boiling water if necessary., Carefully remove the pudding from the pan and leave to stand for a minute or two. Carefully remove the kitchen foil and greaseproof paper and place a large serving plate over the pudding. Quickly flip over the basin and plate over, then lift off the basin to reveal the rich fudgy pudding., Serve with your choice of custard, whipped vanilla-spiked cream or vanilla ice cream and dig in!"

Sift in the cocoa powder, then allow everything to melt slowly, stirring occasionally until well mixed., In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and well creamed, then add the golden syrup and soured cream., Stir your chocolate mixture into this mixture, scraping all the chocolate out with a spatula. Once you've mixed it well pour it into the pastry shell., Bake for 40 to 45 minutes. During cooking a beautiful crust will form on top., Carefully remove the tart from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for at least 45 minutes, during which time the skin with crack and the filling will shrink back slightly."

Stir until it has completely melted. Allow the mixture to cool slightly, stirring in the cold milk until smooth and shiny., Sometimes this mixture looks like it has split. Allow to cool down a bit more and whisk in a little extra cold milk until smooth., Scrape all the mixture into the cooked and cooled pastry shell with a spatula., Shake the tart to even it out and allow to cool for around 1 to 2 hours until it is at room temperature. Dust with the cocoa powder., Ultimately the pastry should be short and crisp and the filling should be smooth and should cut like butter."

over a low heat and warm gently until melted, stirring occasionally., Remove from the heat, pour in the milk, then crack in the egg and whisk well., Sift the flour and cocoa powder into a large bowl and tip in the yeast. Make a well in the middle, then gradually pour in the milk mixture, stirring and bringing in the flour from the outside to form a rough dough., Knead on a flour-dusted surface for around 5 minutes, or until smooth and springy. Transfer to a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a clean damp tea towel and prove in a warm place for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until doubled in size., Chop half the chocolate into 12 equal-sized pieces and put aside, then finely chop the remaining chocolate into tiny chips. Chop any large dried fruits into smaller pieces., When the dough is ready, transfer to a clean surface and use your fist to knock out the air. Roughly stretch and flatten out the dough, sprinkle over the chocolate chips and dried fruit, then knead for a few minutes until smooth again, pushing any chocolate or fruit that escapes back into the dough., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4, and grease and line a 25cm x 35cm baking tray., Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Flatten one piece slightly, push a piece of chocolate into the centre, snapping it to fit, if needed, then fold the dough back over the chocolate to trap it inside. Shape the dough into a neat ball and place on the prepared tray. Repeat with the remaining dough, leaving a small gap between each bun., Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for around 45 minutes, or until doubled in size., Mix 2 tablespoons of flour with enough water to give you a thick batter consistency, then transfer to a piping bag. Pipe thin crosses across the top of the buns., Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden, then transfer to a cooling rack. Warm the honey a little to loosen, then gently brush over the buns to glaze., Slice open while warm to enjoy the melting middle – delicious served with a little butter and a pinch of sea salt, if you like."

Grease two 25cm x 35cm baking trays with sides, line the bases with greaseproof paper, then dust lightly with flour., For the sponges, beat 250g of the butter and all the golden caster sugar together until very light and fluffy. One-by-one, beat in the eggs, followed by the milk and vanilla extract, then sift and fold in the flour and baking powder., Divide cake mixture between the prepared tins and spread out evenly, then bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden, risen and an inserted skewer comes out clean. Cool slightly in the tins, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely., For the icing, sieve the icing sugar into a heatproof bowl. Snap in the chocolate, roughly chop and add the remaining butter, then melt over a pan of simmering water, stirring regularly until glossy. Pour the dessicated coconut onto a flat tray., Once cooled, spread the jam over one of the cakes, then place the second cake on top. Carefully slice into 4cm squares – you should end up with 54 in total., To decorate, get a little production line going – dip a square of cake into the chocolate icing, turning to coat all the sides.

Grease and line a 20cm square baking tin., To make the cake batter, mix the cocoa powder with 100ml of just-boiled water until smooth., In a large mixing bowl or free-standing mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy., Pour the cocoa mixture into the bowl, followed by the eggs. Sieve in the flour, baking powder and 1 pinch of sea salt, then pour in the milk and mix again until smooth., Pour the cake batter into the prepared tin and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until cooked through and an inserted skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 15 minutes., When you’re almost ready to eat, make the custard. Warm the milk in a heavy-bottomed pan over a medium heat until just-boiling., Mix the sugar, custard powder and cocoa powder together in a large jug., Remove the milk from the heat and, whisking as you go, slowly add half to the jug., Pour the custard mixture back into the milk pan and return to the heat., Cook the custard over a low heat until thick, stirring continuously, then break in the chocolate, remove from the heat and stir until melted. Pour into a serving jug., Cut the cake into squares while it’s still warm. Serve with a generous helping of hot custard and a few extra shavings of chocolate."

Finely chop the chocolate and place in a heatproof bowl. Heat the coconut cream in a small pan until hot but not quite boiling, then pour it over the chocolate., Finely grate over the lime zest, reserving a little for garnish, then leave to stand for 1 minute. Whisk together until smooth, then cover and pop in the fridge while you get on with the sponge., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Grease a 37cm x 26.5cm baking tray with the unsalted butter and line the base with greaseproof paper., In a mixing bowl, whisk together the plain flour, desiccated coconut, 175g of granulated sugar, the baking powder, bicarb of soda and 1 good pinch of sea salt., In a larger mixing bowl, whisk together 3 egg yolks (reserving the whites), the oil and coconut milk until combined. Add half of the dry mix to the bowl and stir, then add the remaining mixture and stir until smooth and combined., Place the 5 egg whites in a large mixing bowl (reserving the yolks for another recipe) and whisk on a medium speed with an electric whisk or a free-standing mixer until soft peaks form. Increase the speed and gradually add 75g of the remaining sugar until you have glossy stiff peaks., Add a large spoonful of the whisked egg whites into the cake mixture and fold through with a metal spoon. Add the remaining whisked egg whites and fold, so it’s still light and airy., Spoon the batter into the prepared baking tray and bake for 16 to 18 minutes, or until golden and cooked through., Cut a piece of greaseproof paper, a good 10cm larger than the sponge, and sift with the icing sugar. Carefully loosen the edge of the cake and turn it out onto the paper. Peel off the top piece of greaseproof paper and leave to cool for 5 to 10 minutes., Starting lengthways, roll the sponge up like a swiss roll, using the greaseproof paper as a guide. While the sponge cools completely, make the syrup., Squeeze the juice from the limes into a small pan and add the final 50g of granulated sugar. Place over a medium heat, gently bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until you have a light syrup. Leave to one side to cool., To put the roulade together, remove the white chocolate mixture from the fridge and whisk until thickened and smooth., Unroll the sponge, and drizzle over the lime syrup. Spread over the thickened white chocolate mixture, leaving a slight border around the edge, then roll up again lengthways, using the greaseproof paper as an aid. Set it on a platter and pop in the fridge until you are ready to serve., Finish by dusting with a little more icing sugar, and sprinkle with lime zest and toasted coconut flakes, if you like."

Remove from the heat and leave to cool for 15 minutes., In a separate bowl, whisk the sugar and eggs together until thick and fluffy. Whisking constantly, pour the chocolate mixture into the eggs, until combined., Divide between 12 small ovenproof teacups or ramekins, then place them in a large, deep roasting tray. Place the tray in the oven, then carefully pour enough boiling kettle water into the tray to come halfway up the side of the cups., Bake for 25 minutes, then carefully remove the cups from the tray and leave them to sit for at least 15 minutes before serving., Meanwhile, to make the syrup, squeeze all the clementine juice through a sieve into a small pan., Add the sugar and bring to the boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer for 15 minutes, or until starting to thicken and coat the back of a spoon., Remove from the heat and leave to cool to room temperature. For maximum pleasure, enjoy the chocolate pots at room temperature – if they’re hot, they’ll be too runny, and if they even touch the fridge, they become too firm.

Do not leave the pan unattended, as the condensed milk can burn easily., Once the chocolate mixture has thickened, remove from the heat and stir in the butter., Split the vanilla pod in half lengthways and scrape out the seeds with the back of a small knife. Add the seeds to the pan and stir well. (The scraped-out pod can be used to make vanilla sugar – just put it in your sugar jar and leave it to infuse the sugar)., Let the mixture cool completely, then cover with clingfilm and chill for about 30 minutes, until set., Put the chocolate sprinkles in a small bowl. If you have one, use a mini ice-cream scoop to make a 20g ball and drop it into the sprinkles (alternatively, use a teaspoon)., Coat it liberally with the sprinkles, roll it with your hands to make a neat ball and place it in a mini cupcake or petit-four case. Continue with the rest of the mixture., Store in an airtight container in the fridge, but take them out at least half an hour before serving, as they’re best at room temperature."

Place in the freezer for 20 minutes., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Bake the pastry for 18 to 20 minutes, then allow to cool., For the filling, melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Allow to cool to room temperature, then stir in the chestnut purée., Whip the cream until it forms stiff peaks, then fold in the chocolate mixture. Pour over the pastry base and smooth with a palette knife. Set in the fridge for around 3 hours., Combine the golden syrup and sugar in a pan over a low heat, slowly dissolving the sugar and melting the butter. Let it simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, until golden., Remove from the heat and stir in the bicarbonate of soda – it will fizz up! Pour into a shallow, oiled tin (about 20cm x 30cm) and leave to set for about 10 minutes., Roughly chop and sprinkle over the torte, then serve."

Dust with icing sugar to coat, then set aside., Pour the ale into a large bowl and whisk vigorously to get rid of most of the bubbles., Tip half into a small non-stick pan and put the rest into the bowl of a free-standing mixer with the gelatine. Gently whisk to combine, then set aside., Add the sugar, honey and ½ teaspoon of sea salt to the pan of ale. Place over a low heat, swirling the pan gently, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved., Turn up the heat to medium and bring the mixture to the boil. Pop your sugar thermometer in the pan and leave the syrup to gently boil for 10 minutes, or until it reaches 115ºC and is a light brown colour (don’t worry if the gelatine has set in the bowl, the hot sugar will re-melt it)., Take it off the heat and gently pour the mixture over the gelatine, with the mixer on a low speed., Once all the syrup has been added, turn up the mixer to high and beat for 7 to 8 minutes, until fluffy., In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites with an electric whisk to stiff peaks, then fold them into the ale mixture, along with the vanilla, until combined., Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin. Lightly grease a palette knife with oil and use it to smooth out the marshmallow mixture., Dust with a thin layer of icing sugar and leave it to set at room temperature for 5 hours, or overnight., When you are ready to finish off your marshmallows, place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water and melt it over a medium-low heat. Remove and set aside., Pop the marshmallow block onto a chopping board and cut it into even-sized pieces. Using a toothpick, dip them in the chocolate and leave to set on a tray., Crush and mix in the caramels with a pinch of sea salt. Just before the marshmallows have set, sprinkle some on top, leave to set fully at room temperature, then enjoy!"
Chocolate Guinness cake | Jamie Oliver recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/46263060.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '10']",10 minutes,"“With a heady mix of Guinness and chocolate, this cake is a grown-up treat. Rich and dark, the velvety bitterness of the Guinness brings out the flavour of the chocolate, so it packs a punch, while lending the sponge a subtle tang. The richness is balanced by the sweetness of the sour cream icing, which makes the cake look like the famous Irish stout – black with a creamy head.

Remove from the heat and let it cool to room temperature., Stir in the Guinness – don’t worry if it seizes or splits, it’ll come back together when mixed with the other ingredients., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Grease a 23cm cake tin with butter., In a medium bowl, mix the flour, cocoa and baking powder until combined., In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar for about 3 minutes with an electric mixer until fluffy., Beat half the chocolate mixture into the eggs until combined. Add half the flour, then combine again. Repeat with the remaining flour and chocolate., Pour the mixture into the tin and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean. If the top is colouring too much after 30 minutes, cover it with tin foil., Take the cake out of the oven, cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack., For the icing, beat together the sour cream and icing sugar until smooth, then stir in 2 tablespoons of Guinness. If it becomes too loose, add more icing sugar., Spread over the cooled cake and serve."

Split the vanilla pod lengthways, scrape out the seeds, then place into a pan., Combine with the cream, half of the butter and a good pinch of sea salt. Cook, whisking, over a low heat for about 2 to 3 minutes until it’s just bubbling, then take the pan off the heat and set aside., Place the caster sugar and golden syrup in a medium heavy-based pan over a low heat. Don’t stir, just gently swirl the pan to help dissolve the sugar., Turn up the heat to medium and keep swirling until the sugar turns into a golden caramel., Take the pan off the heat. Discard the vanilla pod from the hot milk, then stir in the caramel with a wooden spoon., Return it to a low heat while you stir in the remaining butter, then remove from the heat and set aside., Scrunch up a large piece of greaseproof paper, make it wet (shake off the excess), then use it to line a 20cm x 30cm baking tin., Pour in the caramel, sprinkle with another pinch of salt, and place it on a tea towel in the fridge for 30 minutes, until you have a thick, gooey caramel., Once the caramel has been chilling for 15 minutes, start the brownies. Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Grease and line another 20cm x 30cm baking tin., Melt the butter in a pan over a low heat. Chop and stir in the chocolate until it’s melted, then remove from the heat and stir in the sugar., Once cooled slightly, whisk in the eggs, then sift and fold in the flour until incorporated. Pour the mixture into the tin., Take your caramel from the fridge, scoop out spoonfuls and dot them into the brownie mixture, pressing to submerge. Once you have a third of the caramel left, drizzle it on top, using your spoon to ripple it through., Bake the brownies in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until cooked but still a bit gooey., Leave to cool for 1 hour, cut into squares and serve."

flaked almonds","Preheat the grill to medium-high, and grease and line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin., Roughly chop and place the marzipan and a little of the cream in the bowl of a standing mixer and beat using the paddle attachment until you have a thick paste. Gradually add the rest of the cream and continue to beat until you have a pale paste., Add 170g of the butter and beat until completely incorporated. Next add the sugar and beat again until the mixture is pale and creamy., Finally, separate and beat in the egg yolks one at a time (save the whites), then the vanilla extract. Finely grate in the orange zest., Sift the self-raising flour and cornflour into a bowl, mix together, then, using a large metal spoon, gradually fold into the cake batter., Whisk the egg whites to firm peaks, then fold into the batter with the large metal spoon, being careful not to knock out too much of the air., Spoon the marmalade into a small pan and melt over a low heat, add a splash of water if needed to loosen, and keep warm., Now to assemble the cake: using a ladle as your measure, spoon just enough batter into the cake tin to cover the base – you’ll probably need to fill the ladle to about two-thirds., Use a pastry brush to spread the mixture evenly over the base of the tin, so it just covers the surface, then cook under the grill for 4 minutes, or until set and golden all over., Ladle another thin layer of batter on top, and return to the grill. Once golden, brush a thin layer of the softened marmalade over the cake – you want just enough for a thin glaze., Continue layering and grilling, glazing with marmalade every second or third layer, until the batter is used up – you should get 15 to 18 layers., Brush the top of the cake with a good layer of marmalade, then run a knife around the outside of the cake. Leave to cool, then cover with clingfilm and chill for a few hours, or overnight, to set., A couple of hours before you’re ready to serve, break the chocolate into pieces and melt with the remaining 50g butter in a heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of simmering water. Once completely melted and glossy, stir through the rum, then set it aside for 10 minutes to cool., Remove the cake from the tin and set it on a serving plate. Pour on the chocolate sauce and use a spatula to spread it evenly over the top, letting it drizzle down the sides., Leave it to set slightly, then garnish with the toasted flaked almonds, before leaving it to cool completely. Serve with a big mug of tea or a festive sherry. This cake keeps really well in a tin for up to 2 days (not that it’ll be around that long!)."

Bring to the boil., Remove from the heat, add the flour and beat into a paste. Beat in the eggs, one by one, till smooth and combined., Transfer the mixture to a piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle., Pipe onto 2 large non-stick baking trays in dollops the size of large walnuts, leaving a gap between them so they can rise. You should get about 40., Wet your finger and gently squash the peak on each so they don’t burn, then bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until puffed and golden., Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack, then use a small sharp knife to pierce a little hole in each., Wash out the piping bag and nozzle, then spoon in the dulce de leche. Pipe the buns with dulce de leche, until just full. It might take a little practice, so don’t worry if you mess up a couple. Persevere, it’s worth it., If making the chocolate sauce, smash up the chocolate and place in a heatproof glass bowl with the cream and a pinch of salt., Place over a pan of gently simmering water (make sure the water doesn’t touch the bowl), and leave until the chocolate is melted and glossy, stirring occasionally., Make a toffee by adding the golden sugar to a shallow heavy-based non-stick pan with 50ml of water., Place over a high heat and leave to bubble for 4 to 5 minutes, or until light brown and syrupy. Don’t stir it, just gently shake the pan occasionally, and be careful – hot sugar can burn very easily, so keep the kids away and don’t be tempted to taste it., Leave the toffee for a few minutes to cool slightly, then, using tongs, carefully and lightly dip each bun into the toffee to get just a very thin coating (you don’t want to break your guests’ teeth) and practise sticking them together., Once you’re happy, arrange the buns on a platter so they stick together and build upwards into a pyramid shape.

Preheat the oven to 100ºC/gas ¼., Arrange the almonds on a baking tray and toast in the oven for 5 minutes. Take them out (turn off the heat) and leave them to cool., Put the nuts into a food processor with 2 tablespoons of the icing sugar and whiz until the almonds are ground to the texture of semolina. Don’t over-blitz, or the oils in the nuts will make it sticky., Sieve another 180g of icing sugar and the cocoa into a bowl, then stir in the ground almonds. Set aside., Melt the chocolate in a small pan over a low heat, then leave to cool slightly., In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites with an electric whisk until they form stiff peaks. Halve the vanilla pod lengthways, scrape out and add the seeds to the egg whites. Beat in the almond extract., Gently fold the egg whites into the almond mix, then stir in the melted chocolate. Leave in the bowl, cover with clingfilm and chill overnight., The next day, preheat the oven to 160ºC/gas 2½, and line 2 baking trays with greaseproof paper. Take the dough out of the fridge and leave it at room temperature for 10 minutes to soften up., Dust the work surface with a little icing sugar and, using your hands, roll the dough into a sausage. Cut it into about 25 pieces and shape them into balls, each about 4cm in diameter., Scatter the remaining 250g of icing sugar onto a plate. Take each ball and roll it in the sugar, making sure they’re all coated in a thick layer., Put them on the baking trays, squashing each one very lightly, so it’s 1cm thick, and leaving some room between each one., Bake the biscuits in the oven for 18 to 20 minutes, or until crinkled on the surface. They’ll still be soft, but don’t worry, they will set., Leave to cool on the trays for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in a tin to keep moist."

Keep mixing and incorporating the flour until it comes together into a rough dough. With clean, flour-dusted hands, work the rest of the flour into the dough, then knead until it forms a smooth, springy and slightly wet dough., Place into a large flour-dusted bowl, dust with a little more flour, then cover the bowl with a damp cloth. Leave in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size., To make the filling, spread the hazelnuts out on a baking tray, then place in the oven for 10 minutes, or until golden. Leave to cool completely., Reserving a small handful of the toasted nuts, place the rest into a food processor with the sugar, then blitz to a fairly smooth paste., Snap the chocolate into a medium heatproof bowl, and rest over a pan of simmering water on a medium heat. Stir until melted., Add the cream and 100g of butter, then stir until smooth and combined. Fold in 1 big pinch of sea salt and the hazelnut paste., Knock back the risen dough, then divide into 14 portions. On a flour-dusted surface, roll each portion out into rough 16cm rounds., Spoon 1 heaped tablespoon of the chocolate mixture onto one side of each pastry round, then fold the pastry over the filling into a half-moon shape, crimping the edges to seal – they should look like Cornish pasties., Melt a small knob of the remaining butter in a large frying pan on a medium-low heat, then add as many calzones as will fit, being careful not to break or pierce them. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway., Roughly chop or bash the reserved toasted nuts., Slice the calzones into wedges or halves, if you like, then serve straightaway with a few toasted hazelnuts scattered on top. If you have any leftover chocolate, melt it and drizzle on top. Repeat with the remaining calzones, serving as you go."

medium heat until the butter has melted. Take it off the heat and cool slightly, then whisk in the egg and compôte. Set aside., Drain the cherries (discarding the soaking liquid) and put them in a bowl with the strong bread flour, cinnamon, cocoa powder, yeast, chocolate chips and caster sugar, along with 1 teaspoon of fine salt. Mix well., Make a well in the centre and pour in the milk mix. Stir it together with a fork until it forms a smooth dough., Dust your work surface with flour, turn out the dough and knead for 10 minutes, or until it’s smooth and elastic., Lightly butter a clean bowl and pop in the dough. Cover with greased cling film and leave in a warm place for about 1 hour, until it’s doubled in size., Grease 2 baking trays and line them with baking paper. Tip out the dough onto a floured surface, and knock it back by kneading for 2 more minutes., Cut the dough in half and, using your hands, roll both into sausages. Slice each into 6 even-sized pieces (12 in total), then roll into balls and place on the baking trays., Cover with greased clingfilm and prove again in a warm place for 45 minutes, or until doubled in size., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/gas 5., In a bowl, mix the plain flour with water (about 5 tablespoons) until it’s a thick consistency. Put it into a piping bag (or sandwich bag with the corner snipped off) and pipe a cross on each bun., Place in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden. When they’re done, remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack., While the buns are baking, make the glaze. Put the honey and 1 tablespoon of caster sugar in a pan and warm on a low heat for 5 minutes until the sugar has dissolved., Brush on top of the buns a few times to build up a lovely sticky glaze. Leave to cool and serve."

bowl of hot water and allow to melt (it melts at about 34ºC, so is still considered raw)., Blitz the hazelnuts in a food processor until very fine, combine with the other base ingredients and press into the tin. Chill while you make the filling., Blitz the pecan nuts until very fine, then add the remaining ingredients (remember to destone the dates) and blitz until everything comes together. Press into the tin and chill for at least 3 hours., Combine the icing ingredients and chill for about 20 minutes to set a little, stirring once or twice., Run a round-bladed knife around the edge of the cake and remove from the tin. Spread the icing on the cake with a palette knife and dust with the bee pollen (if using)."

Crush the pistachios. Place the cream and most of the pistachios in a small saucepan and slowly bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and leave to infuse until ready to use., Beat the eggs. Once the pastry is cool, return it to the saucepan and gradually beat in the beaten egg until the pastry mixture reaches a consistency that lazily drops off the spoon (you may not need all of the beaten egg)., Using teaspoons, space out small dollops of pastry mixture on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden brown., Once cooked, use a skewer or drinking straw to pierce holes in the bases of the profiteroles, then leave them upside down on a wire rack to dry completely., When you’re ready to fill the profiteroles, strain the cream and discard the pistachios. Whip the cream with the icing sugar and vanilla essence until it holds its shape. Transfer to a piping bag and pipe a teaspoonful or so into the centre of each profiterole., Break the chocolate into bites, then melt in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water (without letting the bowl touch the water)., Arrange the profiteroles on a platter and drizzle over some of the melted chocolate. Serve the leftover chocolate in a small jug on the side."

Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes., Once cool, unwrap the dough onto a well-floured surface and roll it out very thin (about 2½mm thick)., Using a 6cm round cutter, stamp out the cookies. You can make them bigger or smaller if you like – you’ll just need to watch the cooking time., Place the cookies on the prepared baking trays and use a skewer to pierce little holes at the top for threading the ribbon., Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until firm., Remove from the oven, transfer to a wire rack and allow to cool completely., Make the icing by sifting the icing sugar and cocoa into a bowl, then gradually add a few drops of hot water until you have a smooth but thick consistency., When the cookies have completely cooled, slather them with a little icing and top with the crushed-up candy canes., Once the icing is set, thread with ribbon and hang from the tree. These will keep for 1 to 2 weeks."

Rub in the butter until it resembles fine breadcrumbs and stir in a pinch of sea salt., Stir in the egg yolk and 45ml water, then bring together into a dough, add more flour if necessary. Wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes., Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5., Line a 25cm fluted tart tin with the pastry, pressing into the sides. Line with baking paper and fill with baking beads or rice. Set on a baking sheet and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes., Transfer the tin to the oven on the baking sheet for 15 minutes. Roast the nuts for the brittle at the same time, until they are golden brown. Remove the baking paper and beads or rice. Return the pastry to the oven for 5 minutes, or until the base has cooked through. Set aside., To make the filling, place the sugar and honey into a pan and set over a medium heat. Once the sugar begins to melt, swirl in circular motions to start the caramel until it’s golden. Remove from the heat and whisk in the cream and butter. Place back onto the heat and whisk until the caramel turns golden brown. Remove and pour into the tart case, then set aside., To make the nut brittle, line a baking tray with baking paper. Put the sugar in a pan with the thermometer and set over a medium heat. Have your roasted hazelnuts ready., When the sugar starts to gently bubble at the edges, tilt the pan to ensure the sugar melts evenly. Before long (about 3 minutes) all of it will be melted. When it gets to 150°C, remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the hazelnuts (do not stir with a spoon). Quickly pour it onto the tray and leave to aside., When the nut brittle is cool, chop or blitz in a processor to small pieces. Sprinkle the pieces of brittle over the top of the finished tart., To decorate with spun sugar, heat the sugar and glucose with 50ml water in the same pan, over a medium heat. Allow the sugar to melt, stir for even texture. Heat for 8 to 10 minutes, until 150°C, then remove and quickly place into an ice bath to stop the process and set aside., Take two forks and pull the sugar out, twirling the forks to make long strands into nests. Alternatively, place a piece of baking paper on your countertop. While holding a long metal spoon with one hand over the paper, pull the sugar from the pan and quickly flick it back and forth over the long spoon, allowing the sugar to form long thin strands, which you can gather. Use these to decorate the top of the tart., Delicious served with crème fraîche or yoghurt."

Line a 26cm x 37cm swiss roll tin with baking paper, making sure it is higher than sides., Blitz the walnuts in a food processor until finely ground, then add the baking powder and a pinch of sea salt., Separate the eggs. Use an electric beater to whisk the egg whites to firm peaks. Gradually beat in half the sugar, till glossy., In another bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining sugar until pale and thick. Gently fold in the walnut mixture, flour and cocoa. Using a large metal spoon, fold the egg white mixture into the nut mixture, a little at a time. Spoon into the tin and bake for 25 minutes, until an inserted skewer comes out clean and the sponge is springy., While still warm, lay a sheet of baking paper over the sponge and flip it out of the tin. Peel off the tin lining and leave to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Drizzle the cake with the marsala and roll from the longest edge, the paper inside. Cover with a damp cloth.

Melt the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Put the icing sugar in a food processor with the butter and blitz to cream. Add the slightly cooled chocolate and pulse till smooth. Place in a bowl and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. Whisk the cream until just starting to peak and then gently stir in the chestnut purée.

When the sponge is cool, unroll and spread with the cream, leave a 2cm border around the edge. Re-roll the cake, without the paper but using it as a guide., Spread the chocolate icing on top. Make wood-effect with a fork, then dust with icing sugar."

Line 2 large baking trays with baking paper., Weigh out all the dry ingredients and very roughly chop the chocolate, pistachios and cranberries into chunks., Put the flour, cocoa, sugar, half of the chocolate, baking powder and ½ teaspoon of sea salt into a food processor. Pulse until the mixture resembles fine crumbs., Beat together and add the eggs and vanilla and pulse until the dough just comes together., Tip onto a floured surface, add the pistachios and cranberries and work the dough to a ball., Divide the dough into 2 pieces and shape each piece into a log approximately 3cm x 30cm., Carefully transfer the dough logs onto one of the baking trays and bake for 25 minutes, until hard on the outside but not all the way through – this will allow you to slice the biscotti without the log crumbling. Leave to cool in the tin., With a serrated knife, cut the biscotti diagonally into 1.5cm-thick slices. Arrange the slices on the baking sheets and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until firm. The biscuits may still seem a little soft but they will firm up as they cool., Melt the remaining chocolate in a bowl over a pan of gently simmering water. Drizzle it over the biscotti and leave for about 20 minutes to set. These will keep in an airtight container for a few days."

Blitz the biscuits in a food processor until they resemble fine crumbs, then add to the melted butter., Mix well to coat the crumbs, then tip into the prepared cake tin, spreading it out evenly., Place in the hot oven for 10 minutes, or until darker in colour, then remove and leave to cool., Meanwhile, to make the filling, add the tinned cherries and their syrup, the clementine zest and juice and 150g of sugar to a pan over a medium heat., Cook for around 20 minutes, or until reduced to a syrupy consistency. Leave to cool and set aside., Separate the egg yolks and whites into 2 separate bowls. Add the remaining 200g of sugar to the yolks, then use an electric whisk to beat for 5 to 7 minutes, or until pale and fluffy., Whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form., Place the cream, cream cheese and vanilla extract into a third bowl and beat into soft peaks., Fold the egg yolk mixture into the cream cheese mixture and gently fold through the egg whites. Spoon the mixture onto the biscuit base, then gently swirl through the cherry syrup., Place the cheesecake in the freezer to set overnight., When you’re nearly ready to serve, make the chocolate glaze topping. Place a medium heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, then add the dark chocolate, cream and butter. Allow to melt, stirring occasionally., Remove the cheesecake from the tin and place on a cake stand., Pour over the chocolate glaze, then decorate with some gratings of dark chocolate and clementine zest. Serve with a gold leaf and sparklers to make it extra special."

Line the base of two 20cm cake tins with baking paper and lightly grease the paper and tins with oil., Mix the rice milk and cider vinegar together and set aside. Don’t worry if it separates – you are effectively making a buttermilk that will give the cake a light texture and help to activate the raising agents., Put in the sugar in a large mixing bowl. Sift in the flour and cocoa powder, then add baking powder, bicarb of soda, xantham gum and salt. Mix together really well., Pour the oil, vanilla and the rice milk and vinegar mixture into the dry ingredients. Mix them together really well either by hand or gently using a handheld blender., Divide the mixture between the two prepared tins. Tap the tins on your work surface to remove any large air bubbles and place on the middle shelf in the oven. Bake for about 30 to 35 minutes (test with a skewer or sharp knife – if it comes out clean, it's cooked)., Leave the cakes to cool in their tins for 5 minutes before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely., To make the icing, put the sunflower spread in a bowl. Sift in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then whisk to combine., Break the chocolate up into pieces in a microwave-safe bowl and cook on high in 10-second bursts until it has just melted. Mix into the icing., Spread an even layer of icing on one of the cooled cakes and then place the other cake on top. Top the cake with the rest of the icing. Decorate with dairy-free chocolate buttons (or fresh berries if preferred).

beaten","Sift the cocoa powder, flour, icing sugar and a pinch of salt into a food processor. Dice the butter, then add to the mix and process until it resembles fine crumbs., In a bowl, mix the egg yolk with 60ml of water and gradually pulse it into the flour mixture until you have a rough dough., Place the dough on a clean surface and knead it for 30 seconds or until smooth, then flatten it into a disc. Wrap it in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. After that, roll out the dough and use it to line a 23cm pie tin. Trim the excess pastry so you’re left with 2.5cm overhang. Tuck this under, ensuring it’s level with the rim to give a raised edge, and crimp with your fingers and thumb. Prick the base with a fork and pop it in the fridge for 30 minutes., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Line the pie crust with baking paper and dried baking beans, then bake for 20 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and return it to the oven for 5 minutes more. Allow the pie crust to cool, then melt the chocolate and pour it in. Leave it to set., For the filling, zest the orange and grate enough nutmeg for ¼ of a teaspoon. Combine in to a bowl with the remaining ingredients, then pour the mixture into the pie crust. Reduce the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and bake the pie for 40–50 minutes, until the filling is just set (be careful not to overcook it as it can crack). When it’s cooked, let it cool, then leave the pie in the fridge to chill overnight., When ready to serve the pie, sprinkle the granulated sugar over the surface and caramelise it with a cook’s blowtorch."

Lightly grease a 28cm loose-bottomed tart tin., Bash 2 tablespoons of demerara sugar in a pestle and mortar until fine, then mix with the remaining demerara so you have a range of textures. Tip into the tart tin and shake around to coat. Tap gently, then tip any excess back into the mortar for later., Slice the edges off the panettone in strips and use them to line the base and sides of the tart tin, pressing down hard to compact and create a pastry-like shell., Halve the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape out the seeds, then put both the seeds and pod into a pan on a medium heat along with the cream, milk and butter, and simmer for 5 minutes or until the butter has melted., Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the eggs and golden caster sugar for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Whisking constantly, add the hot cream mixture to the bowl until combined, then discard the vanilla pod., Now it’s time to build this crazy comfort pudding. Pour one-third of the custard into the base of the tart and leave to soak in for a couple of minutes., Tear up all the remaining panettone into rough chunks, soak them in the bowl of creamy custard for a minute or two (the more it sucks up, the better!), then layer up in the shell you’ve created, snapping up and adding little chunks of chocolate and dollops of marmalade between the layers – there’s no need to be neat about it, you want a range of heights, saturation and textures., Pour over any leftover custard, leaving it to soak in if necessary, then sprinkle with the remaining demerara sugar., Bake for around 25 minutes, or until set. Allow the pudding to rest for 10 minutes, then serve with cream, custard or ice cream, if you like – it’s delicious cold, too, if you’ve got any leftovers!"

Leave to cool, then roughly chop – you want nice chunks so don’t chop them too finely., In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and the chopped pistachios. Finely chop and add the chocolate (if using). Beat the egg in a separate bowl, add the rose water, then whisk well until light and frothy. Gradually add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring continuously until you get a firm dough, adding a small splash of milk to bring it together, if needed., Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper. With lightly floured hands, halve the dough, then shape each portion into a cylinder, roughly 30cm in length and 4cm thick. Place them onto the lined baking tray, making sure they have enough room to spread out as they cook., Bake for around 25 minutes, or until lightly golden, then allow to cool for 5 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 150ºC/300ºF/gas 2. Transfer the biscotti to a board, then use a serrated knife to slice it into rounds at an angle, roughly 2cm thick. Place on the tray, cut-side up, then bake for a further 15 to 20 minutes, or until crisp and golden., Transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool completely. Serve with a nice cup of coffee, or wrap in cellophane, secure with ribbon and give them away as a super-cute gift."

I’ve never really met anyone that doesn’t like a freshly baked cookie, and if anything, since I was a kid it’s just become easier to get pre-made commercial, average, frankly boring cookies. So for me, baking your own is the only way to pass that perfection down the family to the next generation. The problem is, what flavour to choose – there’s so many. Well, I’ve made it easy for you – this, in my view, is the best flavour combo. Bake these, and your face will hurt because you’ll be smiling, chewing and gurning for another one. ”",181,8.1g,4.6g,18.1g,,3.4g,24.9g,,"50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                quality dark chocolate (70%), 1 x 396                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                condensed milk, 25                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                ground almonds, 2                                                                                                                                                                heaped teaspoons                                                                                                                                                                Horlicks, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                self-raising flour, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Maltesers, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                quality white chocolate","Melt the butter and chocolate in a pan on a low heat until smooth and combined, stirring occasionally., Remove from the heat and stir in the condensed milk, followed by the almonds and Horlicks., Sift in the flour and a pinch of sea salt, mix together, then chill in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes (no longer)., Once cool, but still pliable, smash up the Maltesers and roughly chop the white chocolate, then mix it all together., Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3., Divide the mixture into 24 equal-sized balls and place on a couple of large baking trays lined with greaseproof paper., Flatten each a little – like squashed golf balls (you can freeze them at this stage to bake another day if you like) – then bake for around 12 minutes, or until chewy in the middle and firm at the edges. Leave to sit in the tray for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool., If you want to take these devilish cookies to another level, either sandwich 2 cookies with a good spoonful of your favourite ice cream, or even some homemade marshmallow, and squeeze… heaven, or simply drizzle all the cookies with melted chocolate while they cool… amazing!"

optional)","Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Grease a deep 23cm loose-bottomed cake tin and line the base and sides with a double layer of greaseproof paper., For the sponge, smash up the chocolate and melt in a large heatproof bowl with the butter, oil and sugar over a pan of gently simmering water until smooth and glossy., Remove the bowl from the heat and leave to cool for 10 minutes, then, using an electric hand whisk at high speed, one-by-one beat in the eggs until combined., Sift in the flour and cocoa with a good pinch of sea salt and beat for a short while until just combined., Pour into the prepared tin and bake for around 50 minutes, or until an inserted skewer comes out ever so slightly gooey (the top of the cake will rise up and crack slightly, but don’t worry, it’ll end up covered by all your lovely toppings)., Leave to cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely., Place on a cake stand, use a long knife to carefully slice the sponge into 3 equal rounds and remove the top two sponges to separate plates (scroll down to watch the how-to video below)., For your mega-crispy chocolatey rice layer, smash up the chocolate and melt with the butter and cream in a large heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water until smooth and glossy., Leave to cool for 5 minutes (to avoid soggy cereal!), then stir in the puffed rice until evenly coated. Divide the mixture onto the 3 cooled sponge layers and spread out evenly across the tops, going right to the edges., To make the nougat frosting, place the egg whites in a heatproof bowl with the honey, sugar, cream of tartar, a good pinch of salt and a splash of water., Place over a pan of gently simmering water, turn up the heat and, with an electric hand whisk, beat for 6 to 7 minutes or until it starts to form peaks., Remove the bowl from the heat, add the vanilla extract, orange blossom or rose water and a dot of food colouring (if using), then carry on beating the mixture until thick., Leave to cool for 5 to 10 minutes, then evenly top each sponge and stack them up nicely., To finish the cake off, use a large knife to shave some extra chocolate, then sprinkle it over the top (scroll down for a video to show you how to do this).

Lightly grease a 23cm square brownie tin with sunflower oil and line with baking paper., In a bowl, combine the ground flaxseed with 9 tablespoons of water, stir well and leave to one side to thicken up. (The flaxseed will absorb all of the liquid, acting as a binder for the brownies.), Drain and rinse the beans, then put in a food processor and blitz to a smooth paste. Add the flaxseed mixture, sunflower oil, sugar, cocoa, ground almonds, baking powder and vanilla extract, then pulse everything again until you have a rich and glossy batter., Roughly chop the dark chocolate into small chunks, add to the mixture and pulse briefly just to incorporate the chocolate., Spoon the batter into the prepared brownie tin and bake for 55 to 60 minutes, covering the brownies loosely in tin foil halfway through cooking to stop them catching. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool just a little., In a bowl, whisk the chilled coconut cream, icing sugar and vanilla extract until thick and creamy.

Generously grease a baking tray with vegetable oil. Melt the granulated sugar and golden syrup in a high-sided saucepan over a low heat. Once melted, turn up the heat a little and bubble the syrup until it turns a rich, caramel-gold colour., Whisk in the bicarbonate of soda. The syrup will foam up – immediately pour it onto your greased baking tray. Set the tray aside and leave it to cool for 20 minutes. Slide the honeycomb off the tray and roughly chop it up., Line a 450g loaf tin with enough clingfilm to allow it to drape over the sides by about 7 to 8cm, smoothing the clingfilm into the tin to form a crease-free surface. Break up the dark chocolate and roughly chop the almonds., Place the chocolate and margarine in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, stir together until melted and combined to a smooth and glossy finish., Take the bowl off the heat and stir in the chopped honeycomb, almonds, cherries and cranberries., Spoon the mixture into the lined tin and level the top. Fold the overhanging clingfilm loosely over the parfait, then freeze for 1 hour., Remove from the freezer and transfer the parfait to the fridge until completely set. Once you’re ready to serve, carefully lift the parfait from the tin, unwrap the clingfilm and cut into 2cm slices."

Fold the egg whites into the dry mixture until combined., Scoop ½ a tablespoon of the mixture onto one of the prepared trays, then repeat with the remaining mixture, making sure you leave a rough 4cm gap between each spoonful (you may need to do this in batches if your trays aren’t big enough)., Place in the hot oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp on the outside, but still slightly gooey in the middle., Leave to cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely."

Leave to cool for a few minutes, then finely chop and place onto a second plate., Spread the cocoa powder over a third plate., Using a teaspoon, scoop out little balls of the truffle mixture and roll in the palm of your hands, placing them onto a tray as you go. It’s totally up to you how you decorate them – roll the balls in the toasted coconut or chopped nuts, or for a simple finish, roll them in cocoa powder., Return the decorated truffles to the fridge for around 10 minutes to firm up, then serve."

Grease a square baking tin (roughly 20cm) with a little oil, then line with greaseproof paper., Place a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the base doesn’t touch the water. Break 150g of chocolate into the bowl and allow it to melt, then set aside to cool slightly., Meanwhile, sieve the flour and cocoa powder into a large bowl, then stir in the sugar and a pinch of salt. Halve the vanilla pod lengthways, scrape out the seeds, then add them to the bowl. Stir in the oil, soya milk and melted chocolate until combined., Roughly chop and stir in the remaining chocolate and most of the pecans, reserving a few for the top. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, spreading it out evenly. Sprinkle over the remaining pecans, then place into the hot oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cooked on the outside, but still gooey in the middle., Leave to cool for around 5 minutes, turn out onto a wire cooling rack, then serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if you’re feeling extra indulgent."

Place the Armagnac in a pan with the spices, finely grate in the orange zest and bring to the boil. Pop the prunes in a bowl, pour over the spiced Armagnac, cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge., When ready to make the cake, line a 20cm cake tin and preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Break up the chocolate into pieces and put with the butter in a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally, until melted, then take off the heat., Separate the eggs. In a spotlessly clean bowl, whip the egg whites with 1 tablespoon of the sugar until it forms hard peaks. Place the yolks and remaining sugar in another bowl and whisk for about 5 minutes, until you can draw a figure of 8 in it and it retains its shape., Pour the melted chocolate into the whisked yolks and stir to incorporate. Roughly purée the prunes in a food processor, then fold them into the mixture., Combine the flour and ground almonds in a bowl, then fold into the chocolate mixture. Carefully fold in the egg whites, in three stages, so you don’t lose any of the air you have whisked into it., Once everything is thoroughly mixed in, pour the mixture into the tin and bake for about 1 hour, until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean., Leave the cake to cool slightly before turning out onto a plate and dusting with cocoa powder. Delicious served with more hot Armagnac-soaked prunes on the side."

Cut out rounds using a 5cm cutter (re-roll and cut any trimmings), then transfer the biscuits to the baking sheet., Bake for 10 minutes till cooked through. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the second batch of dough., To make the peppermint meringue filling, place the sugar, egg whites, cream of tartar and 1½ tablespoons of water in a large heatproof bowl. Beat with an electric whisk till fluffed up, about 1 minute. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water set over the lowest heat possible, and continue to beat at high speed for 10 to 12 minutes, until stiff peaks form. Remove from the heat, add a few drops of peppermint extract and beat for 2 more minutes, until the meringue has thickened even more., Fit a 1cm plain nozzle to a piping bag and fill the bag with the peppermint meringue. Pipe onto the cooled biscuits in an upward spiral, working from the outside in; leave a small border around the edge – aim for a swirl around 3-4cm tall. Place the biscuits on a tray and leave to set in the fridge while you make the chocolate topping., Break the chocolate into pieces and put with 1 tablespoon of the oil in a small heatproof bowl. Gently melt the chocolate over a pan of simmering water until completely smooth and glossy. Transfer to a small, deep bowl and leave to cool at room temperature for about 10 minutes., To finish the teacakes, hold the chilled biscuits by the base and gently dip the meringue into the melted chocolate, swirling so it’s completely covered. Or, place the biscuits on a wire rack with greaseproof paper underneath and drizzle over the chocolate until each biscuit is covered. Chill the biscuits for a few hours until the chocolate has completely set, and serve."

lengthways and scrape in the seeds. Grate in the orange zest, pulse in the flour, egg yolks and a pinch of salt, then add little splashes of milk until it forms a ball. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour., Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to line a greased, loose-bottomed 27cm-diameter, 2.5cm-deep tart tin. Push the pastry into the sides, prick with a fork, line with 4 pieces of clingfilm, then fill with rice or dried beans. Chill the tart case for 1 to 2 hours., Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Bake the tart case (clingfilm and rice in place) for 10 minutes, then remove the clingfilm and rice, and cook for another 5 minutes. Remove and turn the oven down to 170°C/325°F/gas 3., Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a pan of simmering water., Smash the cardamom pods and heat the milk, cream and cardamom in a pan, then remove from the heat and infuse for 10 minutes., Beat the sugar and egg yolk with a pinch of salt, then stir into chocolate. Stirring all the while, add the milk by straining it through a sieve, discarding the cardamom., Pour the chocolate mixture into the tart case and scatter over the raspberries. Bake for about 25 minutes – the tart should still be wobbly in the middle., Remove from the oven, leave to cool, then chill in the fridge before dusting with icing sugar and serving with crème fraîche, or simply with more berries."

from the fridge and allow to come up to room temperature., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Grease two springform cake tins (roughly 20cm) with butter, then line the bottom with greaseproof paper and dust the sides with gluten-free flour., In a bowl, beat the butter and sugar for around 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Crack in the eggs, then mix in the vanilla extract until combined. Sieve the flour, baking powder, xanthan gum and cocoa powder into the bowl, then fold through. Add the milk and stir briefly until you have a nice, smooth batter., Carefully divide the mixture between the cake tins, then place on the middle shelf of the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until an inserted skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool for 5 minutes, before turning the cakes out onto a wire cooling rack, then leave to cool completely while you make the icing., Sieve the icing sugar and cocoa powder into a large bowl, then add the butter and beat until smooth. Stir in the cream cheese until combined. If it’s a little thick, add a splash of milk to loosen., Once cooled, place one of the sponges on a plate or cake stand. Carefully spread over half the butter icing. In a bowl, crush the raspberries with a fork, then scatter on top. Sandwich the second sponge on top and press down slightly, then carefully spread over the remaining icing and finish with a few shavings of chocolate."

Add the vanilla extract and yoghurt, then mix until combined., Sieve the flour, baking powder, xanthan gum and cocoa powder into the bowl, then fold through. Add the milk and stir briefly until you have a nice, smooth batter., Carefully divide the mixture between the cake tins, then place on the middle shelf of the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until an inserted skewer comes out clean., Leave to cool for 5 minutes, before turning the cakes out onto a wire cooling rack, then leave to cool completely while you make the icing., Sieve the icing sugar and cocoa powder into a large bowl, then add the margarine and beat until smooth. Stir in the soya yoghurt to combine., Once cooled, place one of the sponges on a plate or cake stand. Carefully spread half the butter icing on top, then scatter over most of the raspberries., Sandwich the second sponge on top and press down lightly, then carefully spread the remaining icing over the top and finish with a scattering of berries and a few shavings of chocolate."

Line a 12-hole muffin tray with paper cases., Melt the butter in a small pan over a medium heat, then leave to cool slightly. Meanwhile, sieve the flour and xanthan gum into a bowl, then stir in the ground almonds and sugar. Add the melted butter and vanilla extract, then fold through., In another bowl, separate the egg whites (keep the yolks for another day). Whisk the whites well for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they start to froth. Then, using a metal spoon, stir the egg whites into the flour mixture a little at a time – you want to keep it as light and airy as possible so make sure you don’t stir too much. Roughly chop and add the white chocolate, along with half the blueberries, then stir briefly to combine., Divide the mixture between the paper cases, then sprinkle over the remaining blueberries. Place on the middle shelf of the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden and an inserted skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool on a wire cooling rack, then serve."

Dust the sides of the tin lightly with flour, then tap the tin to get rid of any excess., Break 200g of the chocolate into small pieces and add to a heatproof bowl., Place the bowl on top of a small pan of simmering water over a medium heat, making sure the bottom of the bowl isn’t touching the water, and allow to melt, stirring occasionally., Once melted, use oven gloves to carefully remove from the heat and put to one side – beware of the steam when you lift up the bowl., Use a Y-shaped peeler to peel the beetroot (you might want to wear gloves to do this), then quarter them on a chopping board., Push the beetroot through the coarse grater attachment on the food processor, then tip into a large mixing bowl., Separate the eggs, placing the whites into a large clean mixing bowl and adding the yolks to the beetroot, then wash your hands., Stir the sugar, almonds, baking powder, cocoa powder and melted chocolate into the beetroot and mix together well., Use an electric hand whisk to whisk the egg whites until you have stiff peaks., Use a spatula to fold a quarter of the egg whites into the beetroot mixture to loosen, then once combined, fold in the rest but try not to over-mix., Add the mixture to the prepared cake tin and spread out evenly using a spatula., Bake in the hot oven for around 50 minutes, or until risen and cooked through., To check if it’s done, stick a cocktail stick or skewer into the middle of the sponge, remove it after 5 seconds and if it comes out clean the cake’s cooked; if it’s slightly sticky it needs a bit longer., Allow the cake to cool slightly, then carefully turn it out on to a wire rack to cool completely., When you’re ready to serve, melt the remaining chocolate (in the same way as above), then serve each slice with some yoghurt and a little drizzle of the melted chocolate."

In a saucepan, bring the cream to the boil, add the butter and take off the heat. Pour the cream over the chocolate chunks and leave to stand for a few minutes, giving the chocolate a chance to melt., Stir the mixture and leave for another few minutes. Stir it again to make sure it’s mixed thoroughly, then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until set., Toast the hazelnuts, bash them up into fine bits and place them in a shallow bowl. Place the cocoa in another shallow bowl. With a teaspoon, scoop out little balls of the set truffle mixture. Roll in the palm of your hand, then in either the cocoa or bashed up hazelnuts to coat., When you’ve used up most of the mixture, stir in the dried chilli. Make the last few (surprise) truffles, then place them in the fridge to firm up for about half an hour before serving them with a cup of coffee or wrapping them as a gift."

Brush 8 cappuccino cups, or 150ml cups or ramekins with a little of the butter, then dust them with some of the ground hazelnuts. Tap out any extra nuts and set aside with the remaining nuts and pan of butter., Sieve the flour into a bowl with a pinch of salt, then carefully mix with the almonds, sugar, eggs and egg yolks, zest and milk., Using a knife, scrape out the seeds from the vanilla pod. Add to the mixture, along with the set aside hazelnuts. Fold in the butter and the orange juice. Divide among the cups, then poke the pieces of chocolate into the middle of each., Place the cups on a tray and bake for 15 minutes, until risen but not quite cooked through in the middle. This will make them moist and delicious!, Serve hot with an extra sprinkling of hazelnuts, if you like, and a blob of crème fraîche."

First put the milk into a pan. Bring to a simmer – not a boil – and while it's heating, put a tablespoon of choccie powder and sugar, if using, into each mug. Add a little warmish milk from the pan to each mug – you just need enough to dissolve the chocolate powder. At this point, plonk a few marshmallows into each mug. When the milk is at a simmer, carefully pour it into a plastic jug or flask. I normally do this over a sink as I always end up spilling a bit (the trick is to have a big enough jug or flask so the milk only half fills it – you need the extra space for shaking and frothing)., Screw the lid on tightly, place a cloth over the lid for safety, and shake hard for a minute. Remove the lid, minding the steam, and pour the milk into your mugs. A little stir, and you can slurp your way to heaven!"

To see her teaching me how to make these, watch the video here LINK. Tamales can be sweet, like these, or savoury. They are basically filled Mexican dumplings – I think they’re brilliant. The cornhusks they’re wrapped in are used throughout Mexico. If you buy corn in season it often comes in husks, but the dried husks I’m using here work a treat. You can pick them up online or at Whole Foods Market stores. Otherwise, things like greaseproof or wax paper will also do the trick., Soak your cornhusks in a bowl of warm water or, if you’re using greaseproof paper, cut yourself 16 pieces roughly 12cm x 20cm. In a separate bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, a pinch of sea salt, baking powder, sugar, coconut and chopped pineapple. Add the lime zest and juice and pour in 200ml of water to bring everything together. Mix well, until you’ve got a thick spoonable paste., Put a large pan of water on to boil – the pan needs to be big enough to fit a colander on top. Take a soaked cornhusk or piece of greaseproof paper and spoon a heaped tablespoon of your pineapple mixture into the middle of the husk or paper; if the husks are thin you might have to layer two on top of each other. Fold the sides in to cover the filling, then twist the ends and use string to tie them so they look like Christmas crackers., Lay your prepared tamales in a large colander or steamer, making sure they’re all in one layer and not overlapping. Cover the top of the colander with tin foil and seal it nice and tightly. If you don’t have a colander large enough you can always steam the tamales in 2 batches. Pop the colander on top of your pan of boiling water and steam for about 20 to 25 minutes. About 5 minutes before they’re due to be ready, start making your chocolate sauce., Gently bring the cream to the boil in a pan on a medium heat. As soon as it starts to boil, take the pan off the heat and stir in your chocolate pieces until they’re perfectly melted and combined. Add the cubes of butter and a pinch of salt and stir well until the butter is melted., Open one of the tamales to check that it’s perfectly cooked – it should be solid and the wrapping should peel away from it easily. Take them off the heat and let them cool down slightly so they’re cool enough to handle but still warm and delicious. Lay them on a platter next to a jug of your warm chocolate sauce and let everyone get involved and unwrap their own."

the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. In a food processor, blitz the sultanas, apricots, dates, baking powder and a little of the flour (just enough to stop the fruit sticking to the blades). If you don’t have a food processor, you can chop it very finely. Put this mixture into a bowl with the muscovado sugar, the golden syrup, the egg and the melted butter and stir together. Then add the very hot water and the remaining flour and mix well with a whisk. Divide the mixture between 12 cupcake papers (I like to double up the papers to give the mixture a bit more hold) and place on a baking tray. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes., Meanwhile, melt all the chocolate topping ingredients in a saucepan and bubble for a while until darkened in colour slightly. Remove from the heat and let the sauce cool until it thickens. Then put a blob on top of each cupcake."

Break up the chocolate, put it into a food processor with the butter, sugar, almonds, 1 tablespoon of the cocoa powder and a pinch of sea salt, and whiz until smooth. Crack your eggs, one at a time, into the food processor and add the flour. Whiz again until smooth., Get a deep baking dish roughly 25 x 25cm in size. Butter the dish really well and sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder over it. Shake it around a bit so it lightly coats the whole surface of the dish. Pour the cake mixture into the dish, using a spatula to scrape it all out of the processor. Break the fudge into pieces and sprinkle these over the top of the cake mix, pushing any larger pieces down into the mixture., Pop the baking dish into the preheated oven and cook for 18 to 20 minutes. Take the cake out of the oven and stick a fork into the middle of it. If there’s a little bit of cake mixture on the fork when you pull it out, that’s okay – you want the cake to still be a little moist inside so that it’s nice and squidgy. However, if it seems a bit wobbly, pop it back into the oven for another 3 to 5 minutes to firm up a bit., Let your cake cool slightly and serve it warm and gooey. Lovely with a dollop of crème fraîche, a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a bit of double cream."

I’ve used cherries and chestnuts in mine – although it may not seem like the most obvious pairing, the chocolate makes them friends and I think they complement each other well., Arrange on boards or plates around the room for people to pick at; there won’t be any left over!

Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Line a 20cm x 30cm baking tin with greaseproof paper. In a bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt the butter and the chocolate, mixing gently until smooth. Stir in the cherries and chestnuts then remove from the heat. In a separate bowl, mix the cocoa powder, flour, baking powder and sugar. Add this to your melted chocolate mixture then stir until it’s all combined really well. Beat your eggs then mix these in, too., Pour this brownie mix into the baking tin, and place in the oven for around 15 to 20 minutes. You don’t want to overcook it, so you don’t want a skewer to come out clean. The brownie should be slightly springy on the outside but gooey in the middle. Allow them to cool in the tray for 30 minutes then carefully turn them out on to a chopping board and cut into 3cm squares. Pile them on plates and dust with icing sugar. Serve with bowls of crème fraîche, with orange zest grated over."

It’s a nice little recipe to have up your sleeve if you need to rustle something up with no notice. It’s also a fantastic way of bringing back to life any leftover puds you’ve got sitting in the fridge., You can use cups, glasses or little bowls to make this pud. Spoon or crumble your leftover pudding into the bottom of each, then top with the scoop of ice cream and pour over the shot of espresso. If you’re doing this for kids, you could use decaffeinated coffee. Bash and crunch up your amaretti biscuits, then scatter one or two over the top of each pud and tuck in!"

Leave to slowly melt, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, separate your eggs so you have the whites in one bowl and the yolks in another. Add the sugar to the bowl of yolks and beat until the sugar has dissolved and its silky and smooth. Whisk the whites with a tiny pinch of salt until they form soft peaks – you should be able to hold the bowl upside down over your head without them falling out! In a third bowl, beat the cream until slightly thick and just whipped., Once the chocolate has melted, carefully lift the bowl out of the pan. Add 75ml (3 shots) of amaretto and the cocoa powder to your bowl of yolks and mix well. Tip in the cream and mix again, then fold through the melted chocolate until it’s well combined and a gorgeous colour. Finish by tipping in the egg whites, then keep folding, from the outside in in a figure-of-eight until the mix is smooth and evenly coloured. It will look a bit dodgy at first, but trust me it will come together. Spoon or ladle the mousse into a big serving bowl or divide between little glasses or cappuccino cups and pop in the fridge for an hour or two until set., Just before you’re ready to serve, give the mousse a lovely dusting of cocoa. Pop your dried cherries in a small pan, add a wineglass of amaretto then top with enough water to cover. Put on the heat and bring to the boil, then turn the heat off and leave to stand for a bit. This will bring the cherries back to life. Leaving them in the packet, bash up your sesame snaps in a pestle and mortar. Tip them out, and break up any larger bits that are left so its nutty with a caramelly kick and a bit of a crunch. Serve this in the mortar next to your chocolate mousse with a bowl of those beautiful cherries on the side so everyone can dig in and help themselves. It may look a bit rustic, but honestly, it’s the best chocolate mousse I’ve ever tasted!"

Grease and line a large shallow tray (approximately 25cm by 40cm)., In a large bowl, use an electric hand whisk to whiz the sugar and eggs together for about 4 to 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small pan on a medium heat, then fold it through the sugar and egg mixture with a spatula. Sieve the flour and cocoa powder into the bowl and carefully fold the mixture together in a figure of eight motion. Once combined, spread the cake mixture across your prepared tray so it’s about 1cm thick. Cook for 10 minutes, or until firm and springy to the touch. Leave to cool., Meanwhile, smash the white chocolate and add it to a glass bowl with milk. Sit it over a pan of gently simmering water, making sure the water doesn’t touch the base of the bowl, and leave to melt, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Leave to cool a little., Carefully mix the mascarpone with the caster sugar, egg yolk and vin santo. Once combined, fold through the melted white chocolate. The sponge should be fairly cool by now, so tear it into chunks and use it to cover the base of a 20cm by 30cm serving dish in a double layer (don’t worry if it breaks up). Sprinkle over the Tia Maria and drizzle with the espresso and leave those to soak in for a couple of minutes., Spoon the mascarpone mixture over the top, spreading it out in a fairly even layer. Dust the whole thing with a little cocoa powder, then scatter with some shavings of dark chocolate, if you like. Pop in the fridge until you’re ready to eat."

Mix it all together really well and pour into your ovenproof dish., Drain the cherries, chop the hazelnuts and sprinkle both on top before putting the dish in the oven for about 25 minutes., While your cake is baking, make your chocolate sauce. Place the butter in a small pan with the cream and bring to the boil. Turn off the heat, break the chocolate into small pieces and add to the pan., Give it all a good stir and then leave it for 5 minutes so that the hot cream can melt the chocolate. Add a splash of your desired alcohol and stir until thoroughly combined., To check if your cake is ready, give it a bit of a jiggle. If it doesn’t wobble too much then it’s done; if not, give it a few more minutes in the oven., Once it’s ready, pour your warm chocolate sauce all over the cake and either share it right from the dish or serve it up on small plates with vanilla ice cream or double cream.

Sift the flour into a clean bowl, add the almonds, half the sugar, a pinch of sea salt, the eggs, yolks, orange zest and milk. Whisk up until smooth, then add the rest of the butter to the melting chocolate., Scrape all the melted chocolate and butter into the batter mix and pour into the tin., Break up the white chocolate and poke little pieces into the batter, then bake in the oven for 16 to 20 minutes, or until firm around the edges but sticky and gooey in the middle. This doesn’t mean it’s undercooked ... it means it’s perfect! So be careful not to overcook it or it will just be like a boring sponge., While it’s cooking, bring the other half of the sugar to the boil on a medium heat with 6 tablespoons of water until you have a golden caramel. Remove from the heat, squeeze in the juice from the remaining oranges and stir it in to loosen the caramel slightly., Arrange the orange slices nicely on a plate, pour over the caramel and serve with the chocolate clafoutis and a bowl of crème fraîche or yoghurt (if using).

If you eat these when they have just been cooked the chocolate is quite runny, and if you eat them cold they are nice and gooey. You’ll need two cutters, one about 4cm and the other about 5cm., Grease a large baking sheet. Cream the butter and sugar together until pale. Beat in the egg yolks, then add the flour and cocoa powder to make a dough. Turn out and knead, then pop it into the fridge for a while. Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., On a lightly floured surface, roll about a third of the dough out thinly, then cut out about 30 circles with the smaller cutter (you can do fewer if you want the biscuits bigger). Spread them out on the baking sheet and put a square of chocolate in the middle of each one – make sure you use all the chocolate however many you do. Then roll the rest of the dough out (I always add the leftovers from the first lot of cutting to it and knead it a bit). Cut out the same number of circles with the larger cutter and pop them on top of the chocolate, pressing gently all the way round to seal the edge and keep all the chocolate in., Cook in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, and eat them hot or cold."

Line a 24cm square baking tin with greaseproof paper., Snap the chocolate into a large bowl, add the butter and place over a pan of simmering water, until melted, stirring regularly. Stir through the cherries and nuts (if using)., Sift the cocoa powder and flour into a separate bowl, add the baking powder and sugar, then mix together., Add the dry ingredients to the chocolate, cherry and nut mixture and stir together well. Beat the eggs, then mix in until you have a silky consistency., Pour the brownie mix into the baking tin, and place in the oven for around 25 minutes. You don’t want to overcook them so, unlike cakes, you don’t want a skewer to come out clean – the brownies should be slightly springy on the outside but still gooey in the middle., Allow to cool in the tray, then carefully transfer to a large chopping board and cut into chunky squares.

Pour the creamy mixture over the chocolate, whisking as you go, so the chocolate slowly melts. If the mixture splits slightly, don’t worry, you can bring it right by adding a splash of boiling water., Add a pinch of sea salt. then stir in the brandy. Once completely smooth, pour the mixture into a nice serving dish or bowl., Place in the fridge for 2 hours to set. About 30 minutes before you’re ready to make your truffles, pull the bowl out of the fridge and let the chocolate warm up to room temperature., Put the mixed nuts into a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to bash them up quite finely. Get some little saucers or bowls and put the nuts in one and the cocoa powder in the other., Put a teacup filled with boiled water on the tray and pop a few teaspoons in there for scooping the chocolate. Get everyone around the table to spoon their own truffles out of the serving dish and roll them in cocoa powder, crushed nuts or anything else you fancy. Or, you can let them spread their truffles over a biscotti (a bit like posh Nutella!). Serve with a few glasses of chilled Vin Santo."
