Generally you get better tuna in good fishmongers than in supermarkets, but sometimes the supermarkets get a good batch in, so keep your eyes peeled. There is a bit of a thing about it being fashionable to serve tuna pink; if you buy good-quality fresh tuna the last thing you want to do is cook it all the way through and make it taste like tinned tuna, so yes, good-quality fresh tuna should be served rare or very pink. ”",243,1.8g,0.5g,0.2g,0.9g,57.1g,0.4g,0.6g,"1                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                 dried red chilli, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                coriander seeds, ½                                                                                                                                                                a clove of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 1                                                                                                                                                                good handful of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil, 1                                                                                                                                                                good handful of                                                                                                                                                                fresh coriander, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 4 x 225                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                tuna steaks                                                                                                                                                                , ideally 2cm thick, from sustainable sources","Smash up the chilli and the coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar., Peel and chop the garlic, pick and finely chop the herb leaves and add it all to the pestle and mortar with a drizzle of oil and lemon juice, to taste. Mix together, and season with sea salt and black pepper., Lay out your tuna steaks on a tray, season both sides and rub all over with the herb mixture., There are two nice ways to cook it: I prefer to cook it on a griddle pan or in a frying pan., Your pan should be very, very hot. Put in the tuna and what you want to do is sear it so that it toasts, fries and browns (about 45 to 60 seconds on each side)., Once cooked, I like to rip the steaks in half and serve with salad and chips or boiled potatoes and a big wedge of lemon. It’s quite sexy sometimes with some marinated sun-dried tomatoes, olives, basil… The possibilities are endless."

the cinnamon, black pepper, curry leaves and a good pinch of salt. Give it a good bash until everything has broken down., Add 3 tablespoons of boiling water and muddle to make a smooth paste., Cut the tuna into 6 even chunks, rub all over with the paste, then leave to marinate for 20 minutes., Meanwhile, for the rice, peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then place in a shallow pan on a medium heat with the butter. Roughly chop the pandan and add to the pan. Tear in the curry leaves, then give everything a good stir and cook for 8 minutes or until softened, but not coloured., Stir in the turmeric, add the rice and cook for a few minutes more., Pour in 2 mugfuls (300ml) of boiling water, season with a good pinch of sea salt, then pop the lid and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed. Turn off the heat and leave it to steam for a further 10 minutes., Line a lidded clay pot or a small cast iron pan with a piece of banana leaf. Pop the fish in the bottom in a single layer, then cover with another piece of banana leaf, and the lid. Place the pan on the hob over a low heat and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until just cooked through., To make the sambal, deseed and finely chop the tomatoes, and trim and finely slice the chilli (deseed if you like). Scrape out the coconut with a fork (about 100g) and combine in a bowl with the tomato and chilli. Finely zest over the limes, then squeeze in the juice and season to taste., Line 2 plates with banana leaves and arrange a little bit of everything on each. Garnish with extra shaved coconut and chilli flakes, if you like."

I love the way she uses pecorino as a seasoning, which is contrary to the ‘no cheese and fish’ rule, while the crushed almonds give texture, creaminess and depth of flavour. To make this recipe sing like Pavarotti, you really need baby or crunchy courgettes, so it’s best made in the summer. ”",581,23.3g,4.5g,8.6g,0.8g,34g,62.9g,3.7g,"50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                whole almonds, 1                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                onion, 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    anchovy fillets in oil                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources, olive oil, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried fettuccine                                                                                                                                                                , or linguine, 4                                                                                                                                                                baby                                                                                                                                                                courgettes                                                                                                                                                                , with flowers, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                yellowfin tuna                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources, 1 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                quality cherry tomatoes, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 30                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                pecorino cheese, extra virgin olive oil","Lightly toast the almonds in a large frying pan on a medium heat, then tip into a pestle and mortar, leaving the pan on the heat., Peel the onion and garlic, finely chop with the anchovies and add to the pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Fry for 4 minutes, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions., Slice the courgettes ½cm thick, reserving the flowers, chop the tuna into rough 1cm dice, then stir both into the frying pan. Scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands, squeeze over the lemon juice and leave to tick away, stirring regularly., Finely grate the pecorino. Pound the almonds until fine., Once cooked, use tongs to drag the pasta straight into the frying pan, letting some starchy cooking water go with it. Toss together, then turn the heat off, tear in the courgette flowers and toss in the pecorino and most of the almonds., Check the seasoning, loosen with an extra splash of cooking water, if needed, and serve, sprinkled with the remaining almonds, finished with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

Meanwhile, finely slice the garlic and chilli, then roughly chop the anchovies and tomatoes. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil (use the oil from the tin of tuna for added flavour, if you can) in a frying pan over a medium heat, then add the garlic, chilli, anchovies and capers. Fry for 2 minutes, then add the tomatoes and toss well., Reserving some of the cooking water, drain the bucatini and add to the sauce. Toss well over the heat until lovely and glossy, adding a splash of the cooking water to loosen, if needed. Flake in the tuna, then add some lemon juice and most of the rocket. Toss well to warm the tuna through and wilt the rocket, then season carefully with salt and more lemon juice. Serve with a drizzle of oil, and a scattering of the reserved rocket."

Add 2 tablespoons of oil, the onion, garlic and chilli flakes (if using) and fry for 5 to 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat up to high and pour in the chopped tomatoes. Tear the leaves from the basil stalks, keeping a few pretty ones aside for later, and stir them into the sauce. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes., Meanwhile, place a large pan of water on to boil. Once boiling, add a good pinch of salt followed by the pasta. Cook according to the packet instructions, draining just before it’s done – it’ll finish cooking in the oven., Drain the tuna and stir through the sauce, making sure you don’t break it up too much. Season with a tiny pinch of salt and a generous pinch of black pepper. When the pasta is ready, drain and tip straight into the sauce. Toss and coat the pasta in the sauce, then transfer to an ovenproof baking dish (roughly 25cm x 30cm)., Coarsely grate the cheese and sprinkle over the pasta. Arrange the reserved basil leaves on top, then sprinkle lightly with black pepper. Drizzle lightly with oil, then place in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. Leave to stand for 5 minutes, then serve with a nice salad."

Transfer to a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to cool for around 10 minutes., Halve the anchovies lengthways, then add to a bowl along with the capers, red wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. Scrape off and discard the blackened skin from the cooled chillies. Halve, deseed and finely slice them lengthways, then add to the bowl. Mix well., Mash the tuna in a pestle and mortar to a smooth, creamy paste. Stir in the mayo, a pinch of cayenne, a squeeze of lemon juice and roughly 1 tablespoon of the dressing from the anchovies and chillies. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if you think it needs it., Arrange the turkey slices on a large platter, then drizzle over the tuna-spiked mayo. Now it’s time to get retro – lay over the anchovy fillets in neat vertical lines, then place the chillies horizontally on top so you’ve created a pattern, a bit like a checkerboard! Sprinkle over the capers and the rocket and drizzle over the remaining dressing. Finish with a sprinkling of cayenne and a good grating of lemon zest, then tuck in."

Transfer to a bowl, cover with cling film and leave to cool for around 10 minutes., Meanwhile, using a long sharp knife, slice off and discard the veiny stub of meat from the tuna, then thinly slice against the grain. Place on a plate and squeeze over the juice from half the lemon – the acidity will start to cook the fish., Pick and finely chop the basil, finely chop the dill fronds, then peel and finely chop the garlic. Drain and finely chop the capers, then add the chopped ingredients to a bowl with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Scrape off and discard the blackened skin from the cooled chilli. Halve, deseed and finely chop most of it, then add the chopped chilli to the bowl, reserving the rest to one side. Stir well to combine., Arrange the tuna on a clean serving platter, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, then spoon over the herb paste. Finely slice the reserved chilli lengthways and arrange on top, then serve with dressed rocket and lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Place the sesame seeds onto a tray, then add the tuna chunks, turning them over in the seeds so they’re nicely coated., Heat a good drizzle of olive and sesame oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. Peel and thinly slice the garlic, then add most of it to the pan. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden and crisp, then use a slotted spoon to transfer to a plate (don’t drain away the oil!)., Return the pan to the heat and allow to heat up again, then add the sesame-coated tuna to the garlicky oil. Sear on one side for 10 to 20 seconds. Using tongs, turn the tuna over and keep cooking until you’ve seared only four sides of each chunk. Transfer to a plate., Peel and finely grate the ginger, then add to a bowl with the soy, 1 teaspoon sesame oil and the remaining sliced garlic. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, then mix well to combine. Have a taste and add a squeeze more lemon juice, if needed., Cut the seared tuna into slices, roughly 1cm thick, then arrange on your plates.

Stone the olives and tear into thirds or quarters. Next, add the fennel seeds to a pestle and mortar with a pinch of salt and smash to a powder. Tip into a cup and put aside., Finely grate the Parmesan. Pick the basil leaves and set aside. Roughly chop the stalks, then add to the pestle and mortar and smash to a paste with a pinch of salt. Mix 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a grating of lemon zest and the juice of half the lemon with the basil paste. Spoon it out onto a plate and place the tuna steaks on top. Turn the tuna over in the dressing, then leave them to marinate for about 20 minutes in the fridge., Meanwhile, fill and boil the kettle. Put a deep pasta pan on a medium heat and fill with boiling water, add a good few pinches of salt and bring back to the boil. Drop the spaghetti into the water and cook according to packet instructions. Once cooked, scoop out half a mug of cooking water, then drain the pasta., Meanwhile, put a medium saucepan over a medium heat, then add a splash of olive oil and the garlic. As soon as the garlic is golden, tip in the bashed-up fennel seeds and the cherry tomatoes. Season with a little pepper, cover with a lid and turn the heat down to low. Cook gently for 5 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and sweet, then turn the heat off. Tip the drained pasta into the pan with the cherry tomatoes, stir together and season with a little salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, if needed. Cover with a lid., Put a griddle pan on a medium heat. Tear the basil leaves into a bowl with the olives. Add the rocket, then dress the salad with a squeeze of juice from the remaining lemon half and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Finely chop and sprinkle over the chilli., Season the tuna with a little salt, then place in the hot griddle pan and cook for 30 seconds on each side for rare, or for a bit longer if you prefer it more well done. Stir the grated Parmesan into the spaghetti, adding a splash of the reserved cooking water to loosen, if needed.  Divide the spaghetti between your plates, lay a tuna steak next to each pile and top with a good pinch of the olive salad."

You’ll get small, dainty portions, but each bite will be a real wake-up for the senses. Tartare is seen as a really cheffy thing to make, because most people, unless they’re quite foodie, won’t eat raw meat or fish at home. But if you get some insanely fresh sustainable tuna that looks the business – purply pink and glossy with a fresh smell of the sea – this will be heaven., Pour a few good lugs of olive oil into a small pan over a medium heat. Gently fry the garlic slices until they are lightly golden crisps; don’t let them burn. Remove them to some kitchen paper to drain. Pick 8 coriander leaves and put them to one side in a little cup of cold water., This is best served right away while the flavours are all super fresh, so when you’re ready to eat, put half your bunch of coriander, half your spring onion and half your chilli into a liquidizer and blitz with the juice of 1 lime and about the same amount of olive oil. Season with sea salt and black pepper and balance so it’s got attitude and a kick. If it needs to be loosened, add a tiny splash of water. Finely chop the remaining half of your coriander, spring onion and chilli on a board with the tuna until the mixture is as chunky or fine as you like., At this point you’re nearly ready to go, so lay 2 or 3 of your orange slices in the middle of 4 little plates and spoon your blitzed green sauce around them. Toss the tuna mixture in a bowl with the juice of the second lime and the same amount of olive oil. Have a taste, season it really well, then spoon your tuna tartare over your orange slices. Top with a few tomato quarters and a dollop of soured cream, then sprinkle over some of your garlic chips and your pretty coriander leaves. Serve right away with wedges from your third lime. If you want to add some more sliced chilli or a pinch of paprika, rock on!"

Make sure you get really fresh tuna – it needs to be red and almost waxy-looking., You can try using different fish, such as salmon, bream or scallops, just make sure they’re all really nice and fresh and smell of nothing but the sea., Get your tuna, and with a long sharp knife slice it as thinly as you can. Once you’ve sliced it, you can smooth it over with the side of your knife to make it even thinner. Divide this in one layer between your plates, or it’s even nicer to serve it on one big plate., Next, use this brilliant Japanese trick: cut a V-shaped vertical slit in the mooli and stuff the chilli in. This means that when you grate it you get a pink-coloured, chilli-flavoured radish pulp, which is fantastic. If you haven’t got mooli you can get the same effect by finely chopping the chilli and grating normal radishes., So, either grate or chop your mooli or radish and then blob it and its juice over the tuna slices and sprinkle over the shiso or coriander., When you serve it squeeze half a lime and a couple of teaspoons of soy sauce over each portion, to taste, then drizzle with a little olive oil., * Shiso is a Japanese herb with a strong flavour reminiscent of aniseed."

recipe for these as they are something a little different. I’ve seen them made in Sicily in the same way, using a mixture of swordfish and tuna – not jarred or tinned tuna though. These have to be made with fresh fish and they are subtly seasoned with Sicilian herbs and spices – this recipe is just as good as the meat versions!, First make your sauce. Place a large pan on the heat, add a good lug of olive oil, your onion and garlic and fry slowly for 10 or so minutes until soft. Add your oregano, the tomatoes, salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Simmer for 15 minutes or so, then liquidize until smooth. Taste – it might need a tiny swig of red wine vinegar or some extra seasoning., While the tomatoes are simmering, chop the tuna up into 2.5cm/1 inch dice. Pour a good couple of tablespoons of olive oil into a large frying pan and place on the heat. Add the tuna to the pan with the pine nuts and cinnamon. Season lightly with salt and pepper and fry for a minute or so to cook the tuna on all sides and toast the pine nuts. Remove from the heat and put the mixture into a bowl. Allow to cool down for 5 minutes, then add the oregano, parsley, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, eggs, and zest and juice of the lemon to the bowl. Using your hands, really scrunch and mix the flavours into the tuna, then divide the mixture and squeeze it into meatballs slightly smaller than a golf ball. If you dip one of your hands in water while shaping you’ll get a nice smooth surface on the meatball. If the mixture’s very sticky, add a few more breadcrumbs. Keep the meatballs around the same size and place them on an oiled tray, then put them in the fridge for an hour to let them rest., Put the pan you fried the tuna in back on the heat with a little olive oil. Add your meatballs to the pan and jiggle them about until they’re golden brown all over. You might want to do them in batches – when they’re done, add them to the tomato sauce, divide between your plates, sprinkle with chopped parsley and drizzle with good olive oil. Great served with spaghetti or linguine."

Brush the burgers all over with a little oil and season lightly with sea salt and black pepper., Grill the burgers for 2 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking – the cooking time will depend on how thick you make them. It's OK to eat them when they're still a little pink inside, but if you want to cook them through, go ahead., Trim and separate the lettuce leaves, and slice the tomatoes into rounds., Halve the ciabatta rolls or burger buns, then toast the lightly on the barbecue or griddle., To assemble, place a hot tuna pattie into the toasted roll or bun, then layer up with some lettuce leaves, rocket and sliced tomato. Cut the zested lemon into wedges for squeezing over, then serve with ketchup or salsa verde."

Place a heavy saucepan on top so that it presses the spears right down on to the bars. Cook them for 2 minutes, turning them halfway through, until they have lovely charred marks. Pop the asparagus on a board and chop them in half at an angle., Put the asparagus in a bowl with your tomatoes, half the basil leaves, the olives, a splash of oil and a squeeze of lemon juice. Season, then toss it all together and put it to one side while you get the fish ready., Rub your tuna steaks with a little bit of oil and season them. Sear them for about a minute on each side in the griddle pan for a rare steak – leave them for 2 minutes on each side if you prefer them cooked medium, or 3 to 4 minutes each side if you like them well done., Pound the remaining basil in a pestle and mortar then mix in the yoghurt. Season and add some more lemon juice to taste., Put the salad on a plate, then tear the tuna into strips and pop them on top. Spoon over some of the basil dressing and scatter over the baby basil leaves."

Add the piece of tuna. Tie up the bag, squeezing out most of the air so the tuna is completely covered in the juice. Leave for 40 minutes, after which time the outside of the tuna will be pale and ""cooked"". Now carefully pour the grapefruit juice from the bag into a bowl, dry off the tuna and put to one side., For the dressing, mix the sesame oil, olive oil and chillies into the grapefruit juice. Use as much chilli as you like, and season to taste. Tear off a good handful of coriander and mint from the bunches and put to one side to use for garnish later. Finely chop the remaining herbs and really pat these around the tuna to encrust it. Wrap in cling film and place in the fridge until needed., Boil the noodles for 1 minute until they are slightly flexible, drain and allow to steam dry and cool. Add a little olive oil to a hot non-stick pan, add your noodles and leave them until they are nice and crisp on one side. Now flip them over and do the same on the other side – it doesn't matter if some stick to the pan, just scrape them up and turn them over. Divide the crispy noodles between 4 plates. Slice your tuna up about 0.5cm thick – in Japan it's a sign of generosity to have nice thick slices of tuna, but I like them a little thinner as they are more delicate in the mouth., Place the tuna on the noodles, sprinkle over the torn-up herbs that you put to one side earlier, sprinkle with the spring onions and then drizzle a couple of spoonfuls of the dressing over the tuna. Before your eyes you will see the cut sides of the slices of fish begin to change colour and ""cook"". Serve straight away."

Add the lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of olive oil and stir until you have a good drizzling consistency., Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add your peas and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, then remove them with a slotted spoon or sieve. Add the broad beans to the pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, depending on their size. Drain and leave to cool, then pinch the skins off any big beans (you can leave the skin on any small or medium ones)., To dress the peas and beans you want the same balance of acid and oil as you would have in a salad dressing. So, put the olive oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper into a large bowl. Chop up most of the mint and throw it in, add the peas and beans and mix everything around. Add lemon juice to taste. You can serve the dressed peas and beans hot or at room temperature., Heat a griddle pan or barbecue until hot, season your tuna steaks with salt and pepper and pat with some of the oregano oil. Place in the pan and sear for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Personally, I like to keep my tuna a little pink in the middle as this tastes much nicer, but if you’re going to cook it through please don’t nuke it., Tear the tuna into 2 or 3 pieces and toss in a large bowl with the rest of the oregano oil. This will give you a lovely combination of flavours. Serve the fish immediately with the peas and broad beans scattered with the rest of the mint leaves., P.S. Sometimes I love to throw random delicate greens like baby spinach, watercress, even rocket, in with the broad beans for 30 seconds before you drain them. The combination of peppery irony greens, creamy broad beans and sweet little peas makes the veg taste even better."

It's a terrific hot snack or main dish – and with the tuna all torn up it makes a great salad. I like to griddle the tuna for a minute on each side so it has colour on the outside but still remains a little pink in the middle. A lot of people still want to cook tuna all the way through (which I think is madness!), but you must do it how you like best. It's worth seeing if you prefer it pink in the middle though. I'm really going heavy on the herbs in this recipe – 4 or 5 years ago this might have been a bit OTT, but it's really easy to get hold of a good selection of herbs now, so the more the merrier., Feel free to use a couple of tins of beans if it's more convenient. Tinned beans aren't bad these days – they have got much better for some reason. But if you're using dried, which still taste better, soak them overnight in water. They'll double in size. You then just need to drain them and put them into a pan with fresh water to cover. Bring to the boil, then simmer them for around 40 minutes or until tender – sometimes I put a squashed tomato and a potato in the water with them, as it helps to soften the skins. When done, drain them, discarding the tomato and potato, and put them into a large bowl with 8 tablespoons of peppery olive oil, the red onion, anchovies and chillies. Season with salt and pepper and the lemon juice – for a bit of a twang., Preheat your griddle pan until really hot. Season the tuna steaks with salt and pepper, sprinkle over the lemon zest and pat a little olive oil on both sides. Sear the steaks for a minute on each side. While the fish is searing, get your guests round the table. Throw the herbs into the dressed beans, mix up and divide between the plates. Take the tuna off the heat, tear it up and place on top of the warm beans. Nice with some cold white wine."

Scrape it into a bowl with half the coriander leaves and all the stalks., In a separate bowl, mix the lime zest and juice with the ginger, sesame oil, extra virgin olive oil and soy sauce to make a delicious dressing. Have a taste, and tweak with extra lime, oil or soy until you’ve got a good balance., Pour the dressing over your tuna and gently mix together – as soon as the acid from the limes hits the tuna it will begin to cook it so you only need to mix lightly., Click off the stronger outer leaves of your little gem lettuces – you want about 16 in total. Wash them and spin dry well, then line them up on a board. The leaves are going to act as a vessel to hold your ceviche., Divide the tuna ceviche between the lettuce leaves, sprinkle with a little fresh chilli, if using, the reserved coriander leaves, then serve straight away."
