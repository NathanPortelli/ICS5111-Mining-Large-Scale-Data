Set aside until ready to use., Place a large frying pan over a medium heat, carefully cut the tofu into quarters, then cut each piece into four again. Add 1 teaspoon of groundnut oil to the pan, then add the tofu and leave to cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway. Remove to a bowl., Toast 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds in the pan, then toss with the tofu to coat., In a small bowl, mix ½ a tablespoon of cornflour, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar until combined., Peel and finely chop 1 clove of garlic and trim and finely slice 1 fresh red chilli. Peel a 5cm piece of ginger, then slice into matchsticks. Snap the woody ends from 320g asparagus, and slice on the bias., Place a wok over a high heat and add 1 teaspoon of groundnut oil. Once hot, stir in the garlic, chilli and ginger, followed by the asparagus and 150g of beansprouts. Cook for a couple of minutes, or until everything is fragrant and golden, stirring continuously., Stir in the cornflour mixture, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened, adding a splash of water, if needed., Serve the veggies alongside the tofu with some extra sliced red chilli and cooked rice noodles, if you like."

large shallow ovenproof pan on a medium-low heat with 50g of unsalted butter and a splash of olive oil., Line up 500g of asparagus, trim off the woody ends, then finely slice and add the stems to the pan, reserving the tips for later., Season with sea salt and black pepper, then fry on a medium-low heat for 10 minutes, or until sweet, soft and delicious, stirring regularly and adding a splash of water, if needed., Stir in 50g of plain flour, followed by 2 teaspoons of English mustard, and slowly stir in 800ml of semi-skimmed milk to give you a loose white sauce, then leave to blip away for a few minutes., Stir in 300g each of peas and broad beans and leave to warm through while you rip off, roughly chop and stir in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh mint (15g)., Smash up the veg for 1 minute with a potato masher, then grate in 70g each of Parmesan and Cheddar and add the asparagus tips., Tear in the pasta sheets, mix up really well to coat and separate, then pull some of the sheets to the top to create a top layer – use the back of a spoon to create some dips and wells., Roughly bash the almonds so you have a mixture of fine and chunky bits, then sprinkle on top and grate over the remaining 10g each of Parmesan and Cheddar cheese. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and a few scrapings of lemon zest (if using)., Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. Serve topped with a little dollop of pesto (if using), a crunchy green salad and an extra grating of Parmesan, if you like."

Make a well in the middle and pour in 325ml of tepid water. Bring the mixture into a ball with your hand, then knead on a flour-dusted surface for 10 minutes, or until elastic and smooth., Place into an oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size., Knock the dough back by kneading it briefly, then divide into 4 balls. Cover again and leave to prove again for 1 hour., Preheat the oven to its highest setting. Pop a couple of pizza stones in the oven, or use 2 baking trays dusted with flour., For the sauce, peel 2 cloves of garlic and finely slice, along with the 1 fresh red chilli. Place in a saucepan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and fry until golden., Add 1 x 400g tin of plum tomatoes, gently crushing them through your hands into the pan. Simmer for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened, then taste and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., Roll and stretch each ball of dough into 20cm rounds to make 4 pizza bases., Spread each base with the tomato sauce, then pick over a little basil., Transfer the pizzas, two at a time, to the pizza stones or baking trays and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Repeat with the remaining pizzas., Using a speed peeler, shave 300g of asparagus spears and 30g of Parmesan into a large bowl.

Cook for 8 minutes without moving it, or until the fat is well rendered and the skin is golden and crispy., Turn the duck over and cook for 4 minutes on the other side, then remove to a plate to rest, leaving the pan of duck fat on the heat., Snap the woody ends off the asparagus and add the spears to the potato pan for the last 5 minutes, adding the peas for the last 2 minutes, then drain it all and leave to stream dry., Finely chop the chilli and mint leaves (reserving a few pretty baby leaves), and place in a large bowl. Finely grate in the lemon zest and squeeze in half the juice, add 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, mix together and season to perfection., Halve the asparagus spears, then tip all the warm vegetables into the dressing and mix well.

Make a well in the middle, crack in one of the eggs, add 2 tablespoons of cold water, then mix, pat and bring together., Place between two large sheets of greaseproof paper, flatten to 1.5cm thick and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes., Roll out the pastry between the sheets of greaseproof, then line a 25cm loose-bottomed tart tin with the pastry, easing and pushing it carefully into the sides and letting the pastry scruffily hang right over the sides (this will stop it shrinking). Prick the base all over with a fork and bake for 20 minutes, or until lightly golden, then trim off the excess pastry (sometimes I don’t bother as people seem to love the crispy bits)., Halve the asparagus spears, saving the tips for the quiche. Chop and place the rest in a large pan over a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil., Peel, roughly chop and add the potatoes and onions and strip in half the thyme leaves, and cook for 15 minutes, or until lightly golden, stirring regularly., Pour in the stock, bring to the boil, then simmer for 15 minutes. Whiz with a stick blender until smooth, pass through a sieve, then season to taste with salt and black pepper., While the soup is on the go, beat the remaining eggs in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and the ricotta, then grate in the Cheddar and pick in the remaining thyme leaves., Chop and add the reserved asparagus tips, then stir into the egg mixture and tip into the tart case., Bake for 40 minutes, or until beautifully golden. I like to serve the quiche and soup together – it’s a wonderful meal."

finely chop the celery, then peel and finely slice the shallots and garlic., Place a large, deep frying pan over a medium heat, with 2 tablespoons of oil and 20g of the butter. Stir in the celery, shallot and garlic and fry for 10 to 15 minutes, or until softened and translucent., Turn the heat up and stir in the rice. After 1 to 2 minutes, pour in the wine and allow it to bubble away., Have your stock hot, ready to go. Once the wine has been absorbed, reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in a ladleful of stock; keep the rice moving to help it release the starch, which gives risotto its signature creaminess., Keep adding stock, a ladleful at a time, until the rice is al dente., Finely grate in half the lemon zest, stir through the brown crabmeat, then add the remaining butter. Finely grate in the Parmesan, season, beat everything together, then leave it off the heat with the lid on for a couple of minutes., Meanwhile, remove the woody ends from your asparagus and halve the spears lengthways. Toss with a drizzle of oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of sea salt., Stir the white crabmeat through the risotto. Pick and finely chop the parsley leaves and stir through, along with a squeeze of lemon juice., Divide between bowls and top with the asparagus, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, an extra grating of parmesan and freshly ground black pepper."

Finely grate over the zest from 1 lemon, then just cover with boiling kettle water. Pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up., Once done, remove the asparagus to the plate, crumble 20g of flaked almonds into the pan to toast until lightly golden, then remove., Use the base of a pan to flatten the thicker side of 2 chicken breasts slightly, then use three wooden skewers to pierce each chicken breast at regular intervals. Sprinkle both breasts with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and rub with 1 teaspoon of oil., Place the chicken breasts in the pan for 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, but still juicy, turning every couple of minutes, and returning the asparagus to the pan for the last minute to warm through., Meanwhile, mix 2 heaped of teaspoons sun-dried tomato paste with 2 tablespoons of yoghurt and half the lemon juice until smooth. Fluff up the couscous, squeeze over the remaining lemon juice, then pick, finely chop and stir in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh mint. Taste and season to perfection., Slice between the skewers to create chicken lollipops ready to dunk in the sun-dried tomato yoghurt and coat in the crunchy almonds, then serve up with the couscous and asparagus."

Drizzle over a little oil, then finely grate over the lemon zest. Chop and scatter over half the dill, then season with a pinch of sea salt and pepper black., Toss to coat, then lay the dab fillets on top and scatter over the prawns., Coarsely grate the Cheddar. In a bowl, mix the yoghurt, half the Cheddar and the mustard. Finely chop the remaining dill and add most of it to the bowl, then squeeze in the juice of half a lemon and mix again., Snap off the woody ends, then use a speed-peeler to peel the asparagus into long strips.

Leave in the fridge to cool., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., Click off the woody ends from the asparagus, trim the carrots (leave the skin on) and radishes, then cut the potatoes into wedges., Toss all the veg with the oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and season., Place in a baking tray and pop in the oven for 45 minutes, or until cooked and slightly caramelised., Remove the veg from the oven and allow to cool a little., Serve the dip in a bowl alongside the veg with extra watercress, crackerbread and a pinch of smoked sea salt, if you like."

It’s a good staple for older kids to learn how to cook, as they can pair it with any flavours they like, or vegetables that are in season. We think kids will like the way the asparagus and courgettes are peeled to resemble the pasta ribbons (we do too). Peeling is a useful skill that even little children can learn, while older children can master cooking and assembling. You could make your own pasta if you have a machine – it’s a fun activity for everyone to get involved in., Fill a large saucepan with water, add a big pinch of sea salt and bring it to the boil., Peel the vegetables into ribbons with a speed peeler. Set aside., Break the eggs into a big mixing bowl, add the crème fraîche and Parmesan cheese, and finely grate in the lemon zest. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper, then mix well., Cook the pasta in the large pan of boiling water according to the packet directions., Heat a glug of oil in a large pan. Chop and add the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes, until crisp., Setting aside a cupful of water, drain the pasta., Off the heat, add the pasta to the pancetta, pick in most of the mint, then add the veg ribbons, egg mixture and a splash of pasta water., Stir it all together, then add more pasta water if you think it needs it., Dish it up, then top each bowl with the remaining mint leaves and an extra grating of Parmesan."

Carefully cut the pastry block in half with a table knife. Wrap the other half and refrigerate or freeze for later., Dust some flour onto a clean work surface and, using a rolling pin, roll out the pastry into a square, measuring 26cm x 26cm. Cut into 4 equal squares., Place the pastry squares on a baking tray, leaving a space between each., Using the back of a spoon, spread the centre of each square with pesto, but don’t spread it onto the edges., Squash the tomatoes into a large mixing bowl, then snap the asparagus spears into 3cm pieces. Keep the lovely pointy tips and a little of the stalk, but discard the end 3cm., Using a speed peeler, carefully shred the courgettes into ribbons. Tear the roasted peppers into strips and add to the bowl., Pick the basil leaves, reserving the pretty ones for later. Place the large ones in the mixing bowl., Mix the vegetables together in the bowl, adding a splash of oil. Pile a little of the mixture on each pesto-smeared tart and top with two olives (if using)., Break up the mozzarella and place little bits on top of each tart – this will make it gooey like a pizza. Grate over some Parmesan (if using)., Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the cheese is all bubbly., Once the tarts are ready, allow to cool slightly. Sprinkle with the reserved basil leaves and serve with a nice salad for lunch."

Put a large frying pan on a high heat., Rinse 6 spears each of asparagus and broccoli, then trim off the tougher ends and split the spears lengthways (other seasonal greens are great too, so embrace the best that the season has to offer). Place in the hot pan – the moisture from rinsing them will briefly steam the veg before they start to scald and char – turn halfway., Halve 2 ripe tomatoes across the middle and add to the pan cut side down. Leave it all for 5 minutes, or until gnarly and on the edge of catching, removing and tossing in the bowl of dressing as and when they’re done., Peel and destone ½ a ripe avocado, smash up in a pestle and mortar until smooth, then muddle in the juice from 1 lime and season to perfection., To make your tortillas, simply mix 80g of wholemeal self-raising flour with 50ml of water and a pinch of salt until you have a smooth, pliable dough., On a lightly floured surface, roll out one half until 3mm thick and about 20cm in diameter, then cook through and char on one side only in a hot frying pan, so the top bubbles up, and repeat when done, I like to rest them over a rolling pin to give a natural curve to hold your filling., Serve each tortilla loaded up with scalded veg. Divide up and spoon over the smashed avo, then top each tortilla with 1 heaped tablespoon of cottage cheese and a drizzle of chilli sauce, to finish."

Gradually add 125ml of cold water, continuously mixing until it comes together to form a rough dough, adding a splash more water, if needed. Bring it together with your hands, wrap in clingfilm and place in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Snap off and discard the woody ends from the asparagus, then slice the stalks into 1cm chunks, reserving the tips. Blanch the asparagus (including the tips), peas and broad beans in a pan of boiling salted water for 1 minute, then drain. Roughly chop and stir in the spinach so it wilts slightly, then refresh the veg under cold running water. Drain well and place into a large bowl. Trim, finely slice and add the spring onions., Finely slice the bacon (if using), then add to a frying pan over a medium-high heat and fry for 5 minutes, or until golden, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk in the cream, milk and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Chop and stir in the chives., On a flour-dusted surface, roll out the rested dough to roughly ½cm thick. Roll the pastry up around the rolling pin, then carefully unroll it to cover a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Gently press the pastry into the tart tin, moulding it to the tin as you go (don’t worry if it breaks – patch up any holes with spare pastry)., Trim away any overhanging pastry, then line with a double layer of clingfilm. Fill nearly to the top with uncooked rice or beans, then bake in the oven for 12 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove the rice or beans and clingfilm, then return the tart case to the oven for a further 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp., Spoon the greens into the pastry case, put the bacon pieces on top, pour in the cream mixture and crumble over the goat’s cheese. Place the quiche in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until just set. Leave to cool slightly, then serve with a crisp green salad."
Poached Egg & Smoked Salmon | Eggs Recipes | Jamie Oliver Recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/oldImages/large/952_1_1439206036.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",,"“Believe it or not, for many years poached eggs were just getting me every time. They were busting, or just generally not great ... It was really only once I started looking after chickens that I started to get the hang of making them. I think even as a chef I’d been taught to create a vortex in the water then pop the egg into the middle, but if you’re cooking for lots of people, that’s a pain. So this new way guarantees a perfectly poached pouch of egg every time. The exciting thing is that by simply tying the egg up in cling film with a few herbs you can flavour the eggs and have confidence they’re going to cook all right. ”",290,20g,7g,2g,1.3g,26g,2g,2.1g,"2                                                                                                                                                                knobs of                                                                                                                                                                butter, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemons, olive oil, dried chilli flakes, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    head of celery                                                                                                                                                                , plus inner yellow leaves, a few                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh tarragon, 4                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range eggs, 500                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                asparagus                                                                                                                                                                , woody ends snapped off, 8                                                                                                                                                                slices of                                                                                                                                                                smoked salmon (roughly 240g)","Half-fill a medium-large saucepan with water, season generously with salt and bring to the boil. Instead of putting a lid on, put a large bowl on top but don’t let it touch the water. Put the butter, a pinch of salt and pepper and the juice of 1 lemon into the bowl., This is going to sound cheffy, but it’s simple, so bear with me ... Tear off 8 sheets of good- quality cling film, each roughly 40cm square. Get yourself 4 teacups or small bowls and rub the rims with olive oil. Place a double layer of cling film on top of each one and carefully push it in so that it snugly lines the cups. Use your finger to lightly oil the inside – this will help your egg come out easily at the end. Put a tiny pinch of salt, pepper and chilli flakes into each cup then pick the celery and tarragon leaves and divide them between the cups too – try to help these flavours to spread up the sides, if you can., Carefully crack the egg into the cling film, then gently push the yolk down so the egg white surrounds it (without it breaking). Bring the cling film up into a bundle, then tie it in a knot and try to squeeze the knot down so it creates a perfect pouch and seals it (imagine a goldfish in a fairground plastic bag)., Once the water is boiling, remove the bowl (the butter should be melted now) and place your eggs in the water along with the asparagus. It takes between 5 and 6 minutes at a gentle simmer for a large egg. Place the bowl or a lid back on top and after 3 or 4 minutes remove the asparagus to the bowl of lemony butter and quickly toss., Meanwhile, arrange 2 pieces of smoked salmon on each plate. Pull out one of your eggs after 5 minutes and have a little feel (it should have a similar texture to fresh mozzarella). If it still seems undercooked, pop it back in for another minute or so., Neatly divide the asparagus between your plates. Cut off the cling film knots with a pair of scissors, peel away the rest, then carefully lift the eggs with a tablespoon and serve them right on top of your asparagus. If you‘ve done a good job, not only will you have perfect poached eggs, but the herbs and seasonings will have cooked into the egg and become one, like a stained glass window, which is really cute. Poke a knife into the egg to let the yolk run, and serve with wedges of lemon on the side."

Whisk together and put to one side., Add the peas, broad beans and a good pinch of salt to a pestle and mortar, then pick in the mint leaves and bash to a rough paste., Stir in the zest and juice of ½ a lemon, a good grating of Parmesan, 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of pepper (you may need to do this in batches). Have a taste and add a little extra Parmesan or lemon juice, if needed., Place a small non-stick ovenproof frying pan (roughly 20cm) on a low heat. Slice the asparagus in half at an angle, then add to the pan with a lug of olive oil and fry gently for a minute or so. Meanwhile, fold half the pisto through the egg to combine., Pour the egg mixture into the pan over the asparagus, then spoon little bombs of the remaining pisto on top. Stir gently for a minute or so, then scatter over the feta and grate a little more Parmesan on top, if you like it extra cheesy., Place the pan in the hot oven for about 5 minutes, or until golden and risen., Meanwhile, roughly chop the tomatoes and add to a bowl with the pea shoots, a small handful of peas and the rocket. Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil, add a squeeze of lemon juice and toss to coat. Season lightly with salt and pepper and crumble over the feta, if using., When the frittata is ready, turn it out onto a board and serve with the salad."

I’ve used olives to add a bit of saltiness and extra flavour, but feel free to throw in whatever you’ve got in the cupboard that’ll do the same job – anchovies or sun-dried tomatoes would work well., Place a large pan on a high heat. Lay your chicken breasts on a board and cut three incisions into each one like fingers, going all the way through the breast but leaving about 1cm joined at the top. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper. Snap the woody ends off of the asparagus spears. Add a splash of olive oil to the pan, followed by the chicken, pancetta and asparagus. Cook for 10 minutes, or until the chicken and asparagus are cooked through, turning halfway. Lift the pancetta on top of the chicken once golden and crispy., Move the chicken, bacon or pancetta and asparagus to one side of the pan then throw in the tomatoes, olives, basil leaves and butter. Reduce to a low heat and add a splash of wine to help make a sauce. Leave to bubble away and thicken for a couple of minutes., Use tongs to divide the chicken, bacon or pancetta, asparagus and most of the tomatoes between your plates. Squash the remaining tomatoes, mixing them with the lovely juices in the pan, then drizzle over the chicken before serving."

Like the ‘full of veg’ tomato sauce you can always whiz the asparagus in a blender if you think they’ll be suspicious of the green bits., The tomato does a good job of mellowing the flavour of the asparagus and once they’re used to eating it there are loads of wonderful dishes you can introduce them to., Heat a saucepan over a medium heat and add a nice lug of olive oil. Add the garlic and fry until it turns a light golden brown. Add the chopped basil stalks and tinned tomatoes, and bring to the boil. Season with pepper and a tiny pinch of salt, then simmer for 5 minutes., Snap the woody ends off the asparagus stalks and throw them away. You can either chop the asparagus finely with a knife or use a food processor. Add it to the tomato sauce, let it simmer for 1 minute or so, then take it off the heat. Taste, and add a little salt and pepper if needed. Finish off the sauce by stirring in the basil leaves., Cook the tagliatelle according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving some of the pasta water. Toss in the pasta sauce with a little of the water to loosen. Serve with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and plenty of Parmesan cheese."

Heat a wide frying pan and gently fry the chopped asparagus stalks in a little olive oil with the pancetta. When the asparagus softens slightly turn the heat off and mash them roughly with the back of a fork., Cook the tagliatelle in plenty of boiling salted water, according to pack instructions. Add the asparagus tips for the last 2 minutes of cooking time., Drain the pasta, reserving a cup of the cooking water, and toss with the mashed asparagus and pancetta., Stir in most of the Parmesan cheese and season with salt and pepper. If needed loosen the pasta with a little of the cooking water. Serve with the last of the Parmesan sprinkled on top., Tip: Cooking your asparagus with the pasta is a clever way to save on time and washing up."

Having the asparagus tied together looks damn funky and all the ingredients flavour each other as they roast in the oven, which makes them taste sensational. I've used string to tie the bundles together in the picture but it's much better to use a slice of pancetta., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7. Remove the stalk ends of the asparagus by bending them and snapping where it clicks naturally. Feel free to boil your asparagus for a minute if they're not as tender as they should be. Grab 6 spears of asparagus, sandwich one of the rosemary sprigs and one of the anchovy fillets among the spears, and wrap a slice of pancetta round the middle to hold everything in place., Make 3 more bundles the same way, and put them into a small roasting tray or pan with ½ a lemon. Drizzle with a little olive oil and roast in the preheated oven for 4 to 5 minutes, until the pancetta is crispy. Remove from the oven and squeeze over the juice of your roasted lemon. Season if need be. This will make a fantastic smoky sauce with your melted anchovies – absolutely scrumptious."

Score the skin of your fish fillets all over, about 1cm deep, and season., Put the fish fillets into the pan, skin side down, with the squid tentacles. Add the scallops. Run your knife down one side of each squid to open them out, then quickly and lightly score the inside in a criss-cross fashion. Lay them in the pan, scored side down., Add the asparagus and gently shake the pan. Cook for a few minutes, then turn everything over and cook on the other side. Sprinkle over the thyme tips., You’re the one in control of the pan, so if something looks cooked, take it out and keep it warm. Don’t watch things burn! When the fish has crispy skin, the scallops are golden brown with caramelized edges and the squid has curled up and is nicely chargrilled, remove the pan from the heat., Put the squid on a chopping board and roughly slice it into pieces at an angle, then return to the pan. Lay the fish fillets on each plate. Toss the asparagus, scallops and squid with half the chilli, a good drizzle of good-quality extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice. Lightly season and mix together., Divide on top of the plated fish. Sprinkle with the rest of the chopped chilli and the fennel tops, and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil."

Season your beautiful fish fillets with the rosemary, finely grated lemon zest (no bitter white pith, please) and pepper – you don’t need to use salt because we’re going to wrap the fish in the lovely salty smoked bacon. Lay your rashers of bacon or pancetta on a board and one by one run the flat of a knife along them to thin them and widen them out. Lay 3 rashers together, slightly overlapping, put a fish fillet on top and wrap the rashers around it., Lightly heat a large ovenproof frying pan, add a splash of olive oil and lay your fish, prettiest side facing up, in the pan. Fry for a minute, then place the pan in your preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish, until the bacon is crisp and golden., While the fish is cooking, you can make your simple lemon mayonnaise. I do this by mixing quality low-fat mayonnaise with the juice of half a lemon and pepper. You want to add enough lemon juice to make the flavour slightly too zingy. This is because, when you eat it with the asparagus and the fish, it will lessen slightly in intensity. And don’t worry if the mayo looks a little thinner than usual when you’ve added the lemon juice – think of it as more delicate., The asparagus is a great accompaniment because, like the fish, it also loves bacon. You can either boil or steam it; either way it’s light and a nice contrast to the meatiness of the fish. When cooked, toss it in the juices that come out of the fish. Simply serve the fish next to a nice pile of asparagus, drizzled with the lemon-spiked mayonnaise. And if you’re feeling very hungry, serve with some steaming-hot new potatoes."

Roughly chop the asparagus stalks., Get a large, deep pan on the heat and pour in a good lug of olive oil. Gently fry the onions, celery and leeks for around 10 minutes, or until soft and sweet, without colouring., Add the chopped asparagus stalks and stock and simmer for 20 minutes with a lid on. Remove from the heat and blitz with a hand-held blender or in a liquidizer. Season the soup bit by bit (this is important) with salt and pepper until just right., Put the soup back on the heat, stir in the asparagus tips, bring back to the boil and simmer for a few more minutes, or until the tips have softened., Just before I’m ready to serve the soup, I get a wide casserole-type pan on the heat with 8 to 10cm of boiling water. Using really fresh eggs, I very quickly crack all 10 into the water. Don’t worry about poaching so many at the same time. They don’t have to look perfect. A couple of minutes and they’ll be done, as you want them to be a bit runny., Toast your ciabatta slices. Using a slotted spoon, remove all the poached eggs to a plate and add a knob of butter to them., To serve, divide the soup between eight warmed bowls and place a piece of toast into each. Put a poached egg on top, cut into it to make it runny, season and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil."

In this recipe, we're going to get nice thin escalopes of pork from the leg, flavour them and prepare them so they cook quickly. You could also use chicken or even veal in the same way, if you fancy.

Rub the goat's cheese with a little olive oil and cook on a hot griddle on both sides until nicely coloured. Remove and put to one side. Bash up the garlic and lemon thyme in a pestle and mortar (or use a metal bowl and the end of a rolling pin). Add a couple of splashes of olive oil, stir, and rub the mixture all over the pork escalopes., Season the pork then put the escalopes, one by one, between 2 large pieces of cling film and hit them with something heavy and flat until they're about 0.5cm thick. This will make them really tender. Do this to all 4 escalopes., Check that your griddle pan is hot, and chargrill your asparagus, then your courgettes, on both sides. Mark them nicely to give a bit of flavour and character to them. Put them into a salad bowl with the vinegar, 8 tablespoons of olive oil and half the fresh mint. Using the griddle pan again, chargrill your pork escalopes on both sides until nicely marked – about 4 minutes., Tear each escalope in half and scatter these into the salad bowl with the rest of the mint (for a lovely fresh burst of flavour) and the crumbled goat's cheese. Toss well, then place the bowl in the middle of the table and let everyone tuck in."
Asparagus & mint risotto| Rice recipes | Jamie Oliver recipes,"Simple, clean & delicious flavours","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/oldImages/large/31_1_1439297253.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '8']",5 minutes,"“ 
This is such a simple, clean and delicious risotto. When buying asparagus, have a look around because there are lots of varieties available now - purple-tipped, white, thin straggly Japanese, wild Spanish and dozens of good locally grown English. In this recipe, the stalks are finely sliced to an inch below the tips - this will give you lots of flavour from the stalks and you'll then have those whole beautiful tips as a bit of a prize! There are variations on this risotto that I love to do, like sprinkling in a little picked crab or lobster meat or fresh, peeled prawns or sliced scallops - all of these work particularly well with asparagus if you fancy a little upgrade. (If you do decide to add any of these seafood suggestions, then reduce your Parmesan by half.) ”",395,8.9g,4.1g,3g,0.2g,9.3g,61.9g,2.4g,"RISOTTO BASE, 1

Once done, remove from the heat., Using a peeler, shred your asparagus into long thin strips and leave to one side., When the pasta is done, drain, reserving a cup of the pasta water and add the pasta to the frying pan with the crab., Place back on a medium heat, add the asparagus, the zest and juice of the lemon and toss well, adding a little pasta water to loosen., Season to taste, then serve with a drizzle of oil, topped with pea shoots or rocket."
