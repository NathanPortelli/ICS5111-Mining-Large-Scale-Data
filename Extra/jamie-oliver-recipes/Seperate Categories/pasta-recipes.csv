Turn out onto a clean work surface, and pass through a potato ricer or coarse sieve, or simply mash with a potato masher., Add the flour and leave the potatoes to cool. Separate the egg and add the yolk, saving the white for tasty cooking another day. Season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., Knead on a flour-dusted surface for a few minutes until pliable, then divide into 4 equal pieces and roll each into a sausage about 2cm thick., Slice into 3cm lengths, then gently roll each piece down the back of a fork or a fine grater to add grooves, which will help your sauce to stick, or simply roll into balls., Fill the empty pan with boiling kettle water and place on a high heat. Peel the garlic cloves and place them whole into the pan of water with a pinch of sea salt., Strip the cavolo nero leaves from the stalks, add to the pan and cook for 4 minutes. Finely grate the Parmesan., Use tongs to transfer the cavolo nero and garlic cloves to a food processor. Add 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, a handful of grated Parmesan and blitz until smooth. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water and cook for 3 minutes, or until they float to the surface., Tip the sauce onto a large serving platter, sprinkle over some grated Parmesan, then use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked gnocchi and toss to coat. Add the remaining Parmesan., Crumble over the walnuts and Gorgonzola, and serve."

When the garlic starts dancing in the oil, tip in the tomatoes along with a quarter of a tin of water., Scrunch the basil (stalks and all) in your hands to bruise, then add to the pan and season with sea salt and black pepper. Lower the heat and cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly, then switch off., In the meantime, make the gnocchi: place 1 cup (400ml) of water, a pinch of salt and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil into a non-stick saucepan and bring to the boil., Gradually stir in the flour and continue mixing for about a minute until the mixture comes away from the sides of the pan., Remove from the heat, then tip onto a floured board and wait for a minute to cool slightly. Finely grate over the Parmesan, then knead into a dough., Cut the dough into pieces, then roll each out into thin sausages and slice into small pieces (roughly 3cm). Lightly press and roll each piece down a butter pat, or simply press and roll on a board to create a cavity to catch the sauce., To cook, drop the gnocchi into a pan of salted boiling water, and when they reach the top, pick them up with a slotted spoon and add to the tomato sauce (heat through, if needed)., Serve immediately with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, an extra sprinkling of grated Parmesan and a few basil leaves."

Peel and finely slice the garlic and trim, wash and finely slice the white part of the leeks (save the green tops for tasty cooking another day – they work great in soups or stocks)., Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a large shallow casserole pan over a medium heat and add the garlic. Finely slice the basil stalks, then add them to the pan, along with the dried oregano and gently fry for a couple of minutes., Add the chopped leeks to the pan, season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and cook gently for 10 minutes, until softened, stirring regularly and adjusting the heat to low if they start to colour., Tip in the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of your spoon, then half-fill each tin with water, swirl around and pour into the pan. Bring to the boil, then reduce to low and leave to tick away for 15 to 20 minutes., Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water for 8 minutes, then drain, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water., Tip the sauce into a blender with most of the basil leaves (reserving a few to serve) and whiz until smooth (you may need to work in batches), then season to perfection. Return the sauce to the casserole pan, stir through the cooked pasta, loosening with the reserved cooking water if needs be., Finely grate over the cheese, then nestle the frozen spinach into the pasta. Sprinkle over the garlic breadcrumbs and bake for 20 minutes, until the crumbs are golden, the pasta is tender and the sauce is blipping., When it’s cooked, let it sit for a couple of minutes, then sprinkle over the reserved basil leaves, and finish with a final grating of Parmesan. Delicious served with a crisp green salad."

Aubergine & courgette lasagne | Jamie Oliver Cookbook Club recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/140239904.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '6']",,"“My mother used to make the most delicious lasagne – I used to get so excited when I knew it was coming. She was brilliant at making the béchamel sauce – it was always perfectly creamy but never thick and floury. The trick to this was to cook it very slowly and use equal quantities of flour and butter. This is a vegetable lasagne, but it has as much flavour as the traditional meaty offering because you roast the aubergines first. Try to use egg-based lasagne sheets as they tend to have more flavour and are not as brittle when you cook them (or, better still, make your own sheets of pasta). ”",,,,,,,,,"4

200°C/180°C fan/400°F/Gas 6. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions, courgettes and a good seasoning of salt. Cook for 20 minutes, until the onion and courgettes are soft., Heat another tablespoon of the olive oil in a separate saucepan, then add the garlic. Fry the garlic for 30 seconds, then add the passata and cook the mixture gently for 20 minutes, until reduced by half. Season with salt and pepper, then stir through the basil., Brush both sides of the aubergine slices with olive oil and season them with salt. Place the aubergines in an even layer on a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Bake them for 15 minutes, then turn them over and bake them for a further 15 minutes. Remove the slices from the oven and, when they are cool enough to handle, cut them into halfmoons. Set them aside and leave the oven on., To make the béchamel, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a low heat. When the butter has melted, add the flour and cook it out for a couple of minutes, stirring to combine. Next, add the hot milk and stir continuously to avoid any lumps forming. Cook the sauce gently for 20 minutes, stirring all the while, until smooth and thickened, then mix in the Parmesan and check the seasoning. Leave to one side., Mix the aubergines, courgettes, onions and tomato sauce together in a large bowl and check that everything is seasoned well., Use the remaining olive oil to oil a baking dish, then place a layer of lasagne sheets in the base of the dish. Add one-third of the vegetable mixture in an even layer, then top this with one-quarter of the béchamel sauce. Repeat this twice more, then finish with a layer of lasagne sheets and a final layer of béchamel sauce. Sprinkle the top with some more Parmesan, then bake the lasagne for 35 minutes, until the pasta is cooked and the top is golden. Serve with a little extra grated Parmesan on top, if you like."

Add the fennel to the spaghetti pan for the last few minutes of cooking., Reserving a mugful of cooking water, drain the spaghetti and fennel over the spinach in the colander, so that the spinach starts to wilt. Return the pasta, fennel and spinach to the pan, and toss with the sardine sauce., Squeeze in the juice from 1 lemon, loosening with a splash of cooking water, if needed., Season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, finely grate over 20g of ricotta salata (see ingredient note below) and a little lemon zest, then sprinkle over any reserved fennel tops and 1 pinch of dried chilli flakes., Cut the remaining lemon into wedges for squeezing over, then serve immediately."

according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of starchy water., Meanwhile, slice 250g of squid into 1cm rings, sort through 250g of mussels and 250g of cockles (or clams), giving any that aren’t tightly closed a tap. If they don’t close, discard them. Slice the 4 scallops., Peel and finely slice 1 clove of garlic, pick and finely chop 1 bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley (30g), and finely grate the zest of ½ a lemon. Trim and finely chop 1 fresh red chilli (if using)., Place a large non-stick pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the garlic, chilli and 1 tablespoon of baby capers, cook for 1 minute, then add the clams and mussels. Cook for a couple of minutes, then add the squid, scallops, lemon zest and parsley, and give it a good stir., Scrunch in 1 x 400g tin of plum tomatoes through your clean hands, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes to let the flavours mingle, stirring regularly and breaking up the tomatoes., Stir in 1 handful of samphire (if using) and squeeze in the juice of ½ a lemon. Give the pan a jiggle and simmer for 1 minute more, or until perfectly cooked (discarding any shells that remain closed)., Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pick the meat out of the shells, if you like., Grate in 20g of Parmesan, then taste and season to perfection, adding an extra squeeze of lemon juice, if needed., Toss the pasta into the sauce, loosening with a splash of pasta water, if needed, then finish with a kiss of extra virgin olive oil."

pan, reserving the tips for later., Season with sea salt and black pepper, then fry on a medium-low heat for 10 minutes, or until sweet, soft and delicious, stirring regularly and adding a splash of water, if needed., Stir in 50g of plain flour, followed by 2 teaspoons of English mustard, and slowly stir in 800ml of semi-skimmed milk to give you a loose white sauce, then leave to blip away for a few minutes., Stir in 300g each of peas and broad beans and leave to warm through while you rip off, roughly chop and stir in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh mint (15g)., Smash up the veg for 1 minute with a potato masher, then grate in 70g each of Parmesan and Cheddar and add the asparagus tips., Tear in the pasta sheets, mix up really well to coat and separate, then pull some of the sheets to the top to create a top layer – use the back of a spoon to create some dips and wells., Roughly bash the almonds so you have a mixture of fine and chunky bits, then sprinkle on top and grate over the remaining 10g each of Parmesan and Cheddar cheese. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and a few scrapings of lemon zest (if using)., Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. Serve topped with a little dollop of pesto (if using), a crunchy green salad and an extra grating of Parmesan, if you like."

Halve, deseed and finely chop the chilli (if using), and peel and finely chop the garlic., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil. Add the chopped veg to the pan and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly., Scrunch in the tomatoes (or break them up with a wooden spoon). Quarter-fill the tin with water, swirl it around to pick up the last bits of tomato and pour it into the pan., Drain and flake in the tuna, then add a pinch of black pepper and a tiny pinch of sea salt. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and leave to simmer, stirring regularly, while you cook your pasta., Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of the starchy cooking water., Add the pasta to the sauce, pour in a little of the reserved pasta water to help the sauce stick, then stir well over the heat., Use tongs to divide the pasta between your bowls. Pick and finely slice the basil leaves, then scatter over the top, and serve with a good grating of Parmesan cheese."

then add to the bowl with the juniper berries and bay. Pour over half of the wine, cover, and chill in the fridge overnight., The next day, remove the boar from the marinade and discard the veg, pat dry and mince coarsely (or finely chop, if you prefer)., Peel the remaining onions, scrub and trim the remaining carrot and celery, then run them through the mincer too (or finely chop)., Mince (or finely chop) the pancetta, then place in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the minced veg and boar. Cook until golden brown and all the juices have evaporated, stirring regularly., Pour in a large glass of red wine and allow to bubble and cook away, then tip in the passata and 500ml of beef stock. Simmer gently on a low heat for 3 hours, adding ladlefuls of the remaining stock throughout (a bit like when you make a risotto), stirring regularly., Meanwhile, to make the pasta, crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk together. Season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then add the oil and 250ml water. Gradually add the flour, patting and bringing it together as you go, then tip out onto a flour-dusted work surface and knead until smooth and silky. Wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest for 30 minutes., Take a quarter of the dough (wrap the remaining back up in the clingfilm to stop it from drying out), then roll out as thinly as you can with a large rolling pin (ideally around 2mm thick), dusting with extra flour as you go., Cut the dough in half across the middle, then roll up each piece into a loose cylinder. Slice into 1.5cm strips, tossing lightly with your fingertips to separate into pappardelle. Repeat with the remaining pasta and divide into portions, ready for cooking – it’s best to cook the pasta in small batches, to order., When you’re almost ready to serve, taste the ragù and adjust the seasoning, if needed, then add a swig of extra virgin olive oil., For each portion, add a spoonful of ragù to a large non-stick frying pan over a low heat with a small grating of Parmesan (if using). Meanwhile, cook the pappardelle in a pan of boiling salted water for 1 minute 30 seconds, then use tongs to drag it directly into the sauce, taking a little pasta water with it, to loosen. Toss together, then plate up. Delicious finished with an extra grating of Parmesan, if you like."

Pour over most of the flavoured oil and toss together., Make a little well in the centre of the tray, pop in the ricotta and rub all over with the remaining flavoured oil. Add a splash of water to the tray, place in the oven and roast for 50 minutes, or until the veggies are soft and just starting to caramalise., With 10 minutes to go, cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mug of the starchy pasta water, and steam dry., Carefully lift the ricotta onto a board. Tip the drained pasta and a little of the pasta water into the tray and gently shake to loosen all the sticky goodness from the bottom. Toss together, then tip into a serving dish and break the beautiful ricotta over the top. Pick over the remaining oregano leaves and grate over the Parmesan, then serve."

These little beauties freeze really well, so cook up a batch and stash them in a freezer, then all you need to do is drop the frozen ravioli in boiling water and cook until tender and piping hot.

extra virgin olive oil","Pile the flour into a large bowl or a clean work surface and make a well in the middle. Separate the eggs and add the yolks to the well (pop the egg whites in the freezer for making meringues another day). Use a fork to whip up the egg yolks, then gradually bring the flour in from the outside. When it becomes too hard to mix, get your clean floured hands in there and bring it together into a ball of dough. Knead on a flour-dusted surface for around 4 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Wrap in a damp cloth and leave to relax for 30 minutes., To make the filling, tear one piece of prosciutto into rough pieces and finely chop the other. Place in a bowl, finely grate in the lemon zest and add a good grating of nutmeg (about ¼), then grate in the Parmesan and crumble in the ricotta. Use a fork to mash everything together and season with black pepper., On a clean flour-dusted surface, roll out the pasta dough so it’s 1mm thick. Spoon heaped teaspoons of filling every 7cm or so along your sheet of pasta in the very middle. Brush the exposed pasta lightly with water and fold the sheet of pasta in half over the filling., Working from one side, gently seal around the filling, pushing out the air. Cut into squares with a knife or roller cutter, or stamp them out with a pastry cutter, placing them on a semolina-dusted tray as you go., To make the quick tomato sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic. Place a large pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Cook the garlic and chilli flakes for 2 minutes, or until lightly golden, then scrunch in the tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and tear in the basil leaves, reserving a few baby ones for garnish., Cook the ravioli in a large pan of boiling salted water for 3 minutes, or until tender, then drain – you may need to work in batches., To make the lemon sauce, melt the butter in a small frying pan over a medium heat and add the lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Toss in the cooked ravioli, then grate in the Parmesan, 1 tablespoon of oil and a little starchy cooking water., To serve, spoon the tomato sauce onto serving plates, and top with the lemon sauce-coated ravioli.

Pile the flour into a large bowl and make a well in the middle. Add the eggs to the well, use a fork to whip up the eggs until smooth (add a tablespoon of cold water, if needed), then gradually bring the flour in from the outside until it becomes too hard to mix. With floured hands, bring it together into a ball of dough., Knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for 4 minutes, or until smooth and elastic (add a touch more water or flour, if needed). Cover with a clean damp tea towel and leave to relax for 30 minutes., For the filling, you’ll need to wear rubber gloves. Rinse the nettles in cold water, then strip the leaves into a large bowl, discarding the stalks. Trim the leeks, halve lengthways, wash and slice 2cm thick., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1 knob of butter, strip in the marjoram and stir in the leeks. Season with a small pinch of sea salt, add a grating of nutmeg, and sweat for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly., Stir the nettle leaves into the pan, allow to wilt down completely (about 5 minutes), then turn off the heat. If using spinach, blanch it in boiling water first, drain in a colander and squeeze out the excess water before adding it to the herby leek pan, then stir through and turn off the heat., Tip the mixture onto a board and chop super-finely. Finely grate over most of the Parmesan, and add the soft cheese, then chop again, mixing as you go., To make the ravioli, take a third of the pasta dough (save the rest in a container in the fridge for tasty cooking another day) and roll out a sheet that is just 1mm thick – use a pasta machine, or do it by hand with a rolling pin., Once you have a thin sheet (you should be able to see your hand through it), lay it out horizontally on a flour-dusted surface in front of you. Place teaspoonfuls of your filling along the lower half of the pasta sheet, 8cm apart. Brush the upper edge of the pasta with water and fold it towards you, covering the filling and pressing around it to remove any air., Use a pasta cutter or knife to cut out the ravioli. Pop them on a flour-dusted tray and repeat with the rest of the dough., Place a large pan of water on to boil with a good pinch of salt. Get a small saucepan on a low heat and add a knob of butter, letting it slowly melt., Reduce the water to a simmer, and cook 6 pieces of ravioli at a time (2 portions) for 1 minute, or until cooked but still with a little bite., Scoop the pasta straight into the buttery sauce, bringing some starchy cooking water with it, toss gently, then spoon on to warmed plates., Finish each portion with shavings of Parmesan. Serve up to your first lucky guests, while you crack on with the next 2 portions."

Trim the leek, halve it lengthways, wash it, then finely slice. Finely slice the broccoli stalks, reserving the tips., Put a large, non-stick, shallow casserole pan on a medium heat., Put 1 tablespoon of olive oil into the pan, with the spring onions, leeks and broccoli stalks. Peel and finely chop the garlic and add to the pan., Add the frozen spinach and peas, then add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until soft but not coloured and the spinach has defrosted, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water, according to the packet instructions, adding the broccoli florets for the last 2 minutes., While everything is ticking away, finely grate the Parmesan., Scoop or pour out about 200ml of cooking water from the pasta into your veg pan. Now, you can either leave your sauce chunky, blitz it until smooth in a blender, or use a hand blender to go somewhere in between – it’s up to you., Drain the pasta and broccoli, and tip it into the sauce. Add 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and the grated Parmesan, and toss it all together., I like to finish this with a sprinkling of fresh herbs – parsley, basil, thyme, whatever you’ve got. A little extra grating of Parmesan is always nice, and a big salad on the side."

Use a sharp knife to slice it ½cm thick, then toss it with your hands to separate the strands., Cook in boiling salted water for 2 minutes, then drain and toss with your chosen sauce."

When it comes to the type of pasta, you can serve carbonara with spaghetti or linguine, but I’ve been told by Italian mammas (who I don’t argue with!) that penne is the original, so that’s what I’m using in this recipe. Before you start cooking, it’s important to get yourself a very large pan, or use a high-sided roasting tray so you can give the pasta a good toss. ”",459,14.3g,5.4g,6.5g,0.8g,20.4g,66g,4.2g,"6                                                                                                                                                                medium                                                                                                                                                                green and yellow courgettes, 500                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                penne, 4                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                eggs, 100                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                single cream, 1                                                                                                                                                                small handful of                                                                                                                                                                Parmesan cheese, olive oil, 6                                                                                                                                                                slices of                                                                                                                                                                back bacon, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh thyme                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), a few                                                                                                                                                                                                                    courgette flowers                                                                                                                                                                , (optional)","Put a large pan of salted water on to boil., Halve and then quarter any larger courgettes lengthways. Cut out and discard any fluffy middle bits, and slice the courgettes at an angle into pieces roughly the same size and shape as the penne. Smaller courgettes can simply be sliced finely., Your water will now be boiling, so add the penne to the pan and cook according to the packet instructions., To make your creamy carbonara sauce, separate the eggs and put the yolks into a bowl (saving the whites for another recipe). Add the cream and grate in half the Parmesan, and mix together with a fork. Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, and put to one side., Heat a very large frying pan (a 35cm one is a good start – every house should have one!) and add a good splash of olive oil. Cut the pancetta or bacon into chunky lardons and fry until dark brown and crisp., Add the courgette slices and 2 big pinches of black pepper, not just to season but to give it a bit of a kick. Pick, chop and sprinkle in the thyme leaves (reserving any flowers), give everything a stir, so the courgettes become coated with all the lovely bacon-flavoured oil, and fry until they start to turn lightly golden and have softened slightly., It’s very important to get this next bit right or your carbonara could end up ruined. You need to work quickly. When the pasta is cooked, drain it, reserving a little of the cooking water. Immediately, toss the pasta in the pan with the courgettes, bacon and lovely flavours, then remove from the heat and add a ladleful of the reserved cooking water and your creamy sauce. Stir together quickly. (No more cooking now, otherwise you’ll scramble the eggs.), Get everyone around the table, ready to eat straight away. While you’re tossing the pasta and sauce, grate in the rest of the Parmesan and add a little more of the cooking water if needed, to give you a silky and shiny sauce. Taste quickly for seasoning., If you’ve managed to get any courgette flowers, tear them over the top, then serve and eat immediately, as the sauce can become thick and stodgy if left too long."

Peel, quarter and add the onions, then cover with a lid and cook for 20 minutes., Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic, and pick the sage leaves., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Remove the lid, and once most of the liquid has cooked away, make a well in the middle. Add 3 tablespoons of oil, the garlic, chilli flakes and most of the sage leaves, then finely grate in the lemon zest. Once golden, scrunch in the tomatoes, pour in 2 tins' worth of water, and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally., Remove the pan from the heat, grate in the cheeses, then season to absolute perfection with sea salt and black pepper., Tear in the pasta sheets and mix up really well to coat and separate, then pull some of the sheets to the top to create a top layer., Bash the almonds until fine and rub the remaining sage leaves with oil, then sprinkle on top., Use the back of a spoon to create some dips and wells, and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. I love this served with a big crunchy green salad dressed with balsamic vinegar."

Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7., Halve, deseed and chop the butternut squash into big chunks and rub them with a little olive oil., Bash up the coriander seeds, fennel seeds and chilli in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Dust this mix over your pieces of squash, then put them into a snug-fitting ovenproof dish or roasting tray, covered with a dampened piece of greaseproof paper., Pop the tray into the oven for about 30 minutes, then remove the paper and let the squash roast for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden., While this is cooking, pick the marjoram or oregano leaves, discarding the stalks, and peel and finely slice the garlic., Get a large pan nice and hot and add a little olive oil, the herb leaves and sliced garlic. Move it all around for 20 seconds, then add the spinach., Water will cook out of it as it heats up – this is fine, though, as we will cook it away. Using a pair of tongs, keep the spinach moving quickly around the pan, then after a minute add a couple of knobs of butter and a good grating of nutmeg and stir it around a bit more. Keep cooking until the moisture has cooked away then season to taste and allow to cool., To roll out your pasta either use a pasta machine to give you 4 or 5 long sheets (15cm x 30cm wide) and stick them together using a little water, or you can do what I do and use a rolling pin on a large surface, dusting with flour on top of and underneath the dough. Have a go at both ways., Keep it in a rectangular shape but trim it as necessary. Roll out to the thickness of a beer mat and the size of a tea towel, then lay it out on top of a clean tea towel., Once you’ve done this, spoon a line of squash along the long edge of the sheet nearest you., Sprinkle the spinach over the rest of the sheet, leaving the top 5cm of the pasta sheet clear., Crumble the ricotta over the spinach, finely grate over the Parmesan and you’re ready to begin rolling!, Brush the last clear edge of the pasta sheet with a little water then, working carefully, use the nearest edge of the tea towel to roll the pasta up and away from you, like a Swiss roll., Roll the rotolo up in the tea towel and tie it firmly at each end using some string. You can secure the sausage shape even further by tying some more round the middle if you want. Tie a little extra string at one end so it can hang out of the cooking pot and act as a handle., Now, to cook the rotolo, get your fish kettle or very large pan with a lid and fill it with boiling salted water., Lower the rotolo in and use the fish kettle rack on top to keep it submerged. If using a saucepan, hold the rotolo down with a plate. Simmer for about 25 minutes., While it’s cooking, you need to clarify some butter. To do this, take the remaining butter and place it in an ovenproof dish in the oven on a low plate-warming temperature (80°C). Over the next 10 to 15 minutes it will melt and you’ll see that the milky whey will sink to the bottom., Discard any white bits floating on the top, then spoon out the clear golden butter and put to one side. Discard the whey. You won’t need all the butter now, but it’s quite hard to clarify any less than this – you can leave the extra in the fridge to use for your roast potatoes another day., Now you’ve removed the whey from the butter, you can heat it up more aggressively. So put about 3 tablespoons of your clarified butter into a pan and heat it up. Test to see if the butter is hot enough by adding a sage leaf to it. If it fries nicely, add the rest of the leaves and fry for about 30 seconds until they begin to crisp up. Then remove from the heat and put to one side., When the rotolo is ready, carefully remove it from the pan, take the string off, unroll it and slice it up – a couple of slices per portion., Scatter a few sage leaves over the top, drizzle with a little of your sage-flavoured butter, and finish off with a grating of Parmesan.

Crumble in the chilli, cover with a lid and cook slowly for 8 to 10 minutes while you cook the pasta in boiling salted water according to the packet instructions., Something I like to do which is slightly different (but better, I’d like to think) is to cook the broccoli florets with the pasta for the last 4 minutes – this makes them soft enough to eat but leaves them with great colour and texture., Drain the pasta and broccoli, saving a little of the cooking water, then toss into the other pan. Remove the pan from the heat., Season to taste with sea salt, black pepper, the rest of the butter and finely grate in a large handful of Parmesan. Mix well, adding a little of the cooking water, to loosen, if needed, and make it shine., Serve immediately, sprinkling with another good handful of finely grated Parmesan."

leaves, then roughly chop., Place a large casserole pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the chopped vegetables, chilli flakes and bay, and cook for 15 minutes, or until golden and soft, stirring regularly., Remove the porcini from their soaking juices, finely chop and add to the pan. Strain in the porcini soaking liquor.  Add the wine, then turn up the heat and let it bubble away for a minute or two., Add the lentils (juice and all) and tomatoes, along with 1 tin's worth of cold water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour or until thick and delicious., To make the pasta, pile the flour into a large bowl, make a well in the middle and gradually add 200ml of tepid water, mixing with a fork. When it becomes too hard to mix, get in there with your hands and bring it together into a ball of dough. Knead on a flour-dusted surface for 5 minutes or until smooth, then cover with clingfilm and leave to rest until you’re ready to roll it out., To make the white sauce, heat a large, deep frying pan over a medium heat with 4 tablespoons of oil. Add the flour and stir well to coat, then gradually add the almond milk, stirring continuously. Leave to bubble away for 5 minutes or  until thickened., Meanwhile, place a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat.  Tear in the mushrooms and dry-fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until charred and nutty. Peel and finely slice the remaining garlic., Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the mushroom pan, followed by the garlic. Strip in the thyme leaves and cook for a further 2 minutes, them remove from the heat., Place a third of the cooked mushrooms into a liquidiser with the white sauce and blitz until smooth. Have a taste and season to perfection., Cut your pasta dough into 6 pieces. One at a time, flatten each piece of dough by hand and roll it out to 2mm thick using a pasta machine (or a rolling pin), keeping the pieces long. Place on a flour-dusted surface., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Whiz the sourdough in a food processor to coarse breadcrumbs., To assemble, line a 30cm ovenproof frying pan with a large piece of oiled baking paper., Line the base with pasta sheets until completely covered, leaving an overhang around the edge of the pan. Trim the remaining pasta sheets for your layers., Layer up the lentil sauce, followed by the white sauce, a scattering of mushrooms and a couple of pasta sheets. Repeat until all the elements are used up, saving your final layer of white sauce and mushrooms for the topping. Bring up the overhanging pasta and let it fall over the filling until completely covered., Add the remaining sauce and mushrooms, then sprinkle over the breadcrumbs, grate over the cheese and pick over the sage leaves. Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil., Bake in the bottom of the oven for 50 minute to 1 hour until golden and bubbling. Leave to stand for 15 to 20 minutes, then tuck in! Delicious served with a simple salad."

The name essentially means stretched pasta with pangrattato (crispy breadcrumbs), but I’ve added an ingredient that’s unique to the region – a sweet, dried pepper known as peperone crusco (Senise), which are picked, hung and dried, and have long been integral to many local dishes. Toast them back to life in a hot pan, then chop and scatter them through your pangrattato for something truly special. A joy to eat. ”",660,22.6g,22.6g,11.1g,0.2g,18.9g,95.1g,6.3g,"400                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                durum wheat flour                                                                                                                                                                , plus extra for dusting, 1                                                                                                                                                                kg                                                                                                                                                                ripe tomatoes, 6                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, olive oil, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    peperoni cruschi                                                                                                                                                                , (dried Senise peppers), 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                quality breadcrumbs, extra virgin olive oil","Place the flour in a large bowl, make a well in the centre and gradually stir in 200ml of tepid water with a fork until combined.

Season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., For the pangrattato, halve and deseed the dried peppers and place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Cook for 5 minutes, or until softened, then remove to a chopping board and finely chop., Peel and finely chop the remaining garlic, then fry in the hot chilli oil for 1 to 2 minutes., Tip in the breadcrumbs and fry for 1 to 2 minutes more until golden and crisp, then add the chopped peppers and stir to combine., Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted boiling water for 3 minutes, or until al dente. Spoon the pasta into the sauce, adding a good splash of cooking water to loosen and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil., Divide the pasta between plates and top each with a generous handful of the pangrattato.

While it rests, make the filling., Trim and quarter the radicchio, peel the onion and slice into eighths, then place in a small roasting tray. Pour over the balsamic and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, toss to coat, then strip over half the thyme leaves, reserving any pretty tips., Cover with a sheet of wet scrunched-up greaseproof paper and roast for 1 hour., Prick the potatoes and dry-roast in a separate tray alongside until cooked through, then remove. Once cool enough to handle, scoop the potatoes out of their skins and mash the insides in a bowl., Finely chop the radicchio and onion, then stir into the potato with 1 tablespoon of the balsamic juices from the tray. Finely grate in most of the Parmesan and all the fontina, mix well, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Leave to cool completely., On a clean flour-dusted surface, roll out the pasta dough so it’s 1mm thick and roughly 16cm wide (the width of a standard pasta machine)., Spoon heaped teaspoons of filling evenly down the pasta strips, slightly off centre, leaving a 5cm gap between each. Brush the exposed pasta lightly with water and fold the sheets in half over the filling., Gently seal around the filling, pushing out the air – you can cut them into 8cm circles with a pastry cutter or into squares with a knife. Place them on a semolina-dusted tray as you go – you’ll get about 18 ravioli in total., Toast the hazelnuts in a large frying pan on a medium heat until golden, then lightly bash and tip into a bowl., Cook the ravioli two portions at a time in a pan of boiling salted water for 3 to 4 minutes., Meanwhile, place the frying pan back on a low heat and add a splash of olive oil, a third of the butter, and a third of the remaining thyme leaves and tips. Fry until golden, then remove from the heat., Scoop the pasta straight into the buttery sauce, bringing some starchy cooking water with it, add a fine grating of Parmesan, toss gently, then spoon on to warmed plates., Finish each portion with a scattering of hazelnuts, a little extra virgin olive oil, some extra Parmesan and a few small drips of the balsamic juices, if you like. Serve up to your first lucky guests, while you crack on with the next two portions."

30 minutes, then remove from the oven., Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the onion, put it into a medium pan on a medium-low heat with a lug of oil, the thyme and a pinch of salt and pepper, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Stir in the frozen spinach, cover with a lid and allow to slowly cook for another 15 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated, then remove from the heat., Cut the squash in half, discard the seeds and skin, then mash up with a fork. Keeping them separate, season both the squash and spinach to perfection with sea salt, black pepper and a grating of nutmeg., Peel and finely slice the garlic, then put it into a shallow 28cm casserole pan on a medium heat with a splash of oil and fry for a couple of minutes, or until lightly golden., Pour in the passata, then add a splash of water to the empty jar, swirl it around and pour it into the pan. Bring to the boil, simmer for just 3 minutes, then season to perfection., On a lean work surface, lay out the pasta sheets facing lengthways away from you., Working quickly so your pasta doesn't dry out, brush them with water, then evenly divide and spread the squash over the sheets. Sprinkle over the cooked spinach and crumble over the feta., Roll up the sheets and cut each one into 4 chunks, then place side by side in the tomato sauce. Finely grate over the Parmesan, then pick the sage leaves (if using), toss in a little oil and scatter over the top., Bake for 35 to 40 minutes at the bottom of the oven until golden and crisp. Delicious served with a fresh green salad."

For restaurant service, when the gnocchi mix is made in advance, eggs are useful, but cooked this fresh you don’t need them. She believes the fresher the mix, the lighter the gnocchi, and she’s right – you get a very good result with this recipe. It’s an amazing gift to be able to make good gnocchi at home.

Cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender., Drain and leave until cool enough to handle, then remove the skins., Mash the potatoes using a potato ricer or masher on to a large clean board., Sprinkle over the flour, finely grate over half the nutmeg, season well with sea salt and black pepper, then scrunch and push the mixture together with clean hands. Depending on the potatoes, you may need to add a little more flour – use your common sense., Knead on a flour-dusted surface for a few minutes until pliable, then divide into 4 equal pieces and roll each into a sausage about 2cm thick., Slice into 3cm lengths – this is your basic gnocchi. Now you can gently roll each piece down a butter pat, the back of a fork or a fine grater to add grooves, which will help your sauce to stick, or simply roll into balls., Nonna Teresa cooked her gnocchi 2 portions at a time, as it’s so quick, and it also means they’re less likely to break up. Cook in a pan of boiling salted water for 2 to 3 minutes – as soon as they come up to the surface they’re ready., Remove with a slotted spoon and toss with melted butter and finely grated Parmesan, my Hero tomato sauce (or leftover sauce from a stew, which you can see in the picture), then finely grate over a little Parmesan, to serve. I also like to add a little dollop of pesto – homemade or jarred, it’s up to you."

cherry tomatoes, then cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Drizzle 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil into a bowl, then add a good squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper., Prepare the fruit (removing any stones, pips or seeds, if needed), slicing up however you fancy, then add to the bowl with 50g of rocket., Drop the pasta into a large pan of boiling salted water for just 2 minutes, then use a slotted spoon to scoop it straight into the frying pan, letting some starchy cooking water go with it., Pick in most of the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh basil (15g), tearing up any larger ones, then add 25g of pine nuts and a good squeeze of lemon juice., Finely grate over 15g of Parmesan, then toss together and let the sauce emulsify., Toss the salad together, using a speed peeler to shave over a few ribbons of Parmesan (roughly 10g), then drizzle with 1 tablespoon of thick balsamic. Scatter the remaining basil leaves over the pasta, then get stuck in."

Fry for 4 minutes, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions., Slice the courgettes ½cm thick, reserving the flowers, chop the tuna into rough 1cm dice, then stir both into the frying pan. Scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands, squeeze over the lemon juice and leave to tick away, stirring regularly., Finely grate the pecorino. Pound the almonds until fine., Once cooked, use tongs to drag the pasta straight into the frying pan, letting some starchy cooking water go with it.

Creating emulsification at the very end gives a perfect sauce that’s as much about flavour as it is texture. ”",407,15g,5.3g,4.1g,0.3g,13.3g,58.3g,2.2g,"300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried linguine, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                mixed asparagus                                                                                                                                                                , (wild, white, regular), 4                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    dried red chillies, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                knob of                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter, 30                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                pecorino                                                                                                                                                                , or Parmesan cheese, plus extra to serve, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon","Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions., Meanwhile, snap off and discard the woody ends of the asparagus, then finely slice the spears at an angle, leaving the tips whole., Peel and finely slice the garlic, crumble up the dried chillies, and place both in a large frying pan on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil and the butter. When the garlic starts to sizzle, stir in the asparagus. Let it start to fry, then add a spoonful of pasta water, cover, and leave to simmer on a low heat until the pasta is al dente., Using tongs, drag the pasta straight into the asparagus pan, letting a little starchy cooking water go with it. Turn the heat off, then finely grate in the pecorino and toss together until the fat, cheese and liquid make a natural creamy sauce – loosen with a little extra cooking water, if needed., Taste and season to perfection, then divide between your plates. Finish with a grating of pecorino and a little lemon zest, to taste."

Peel and finely grate in the horseradish, then fry for 5 minutes, or until crisp, stirring regularly. Tip into a bowl and put aside. Return the frying pan to a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Peel, finely slice and add the garlic, strip in the thyme leaves, then tear in the dried peppers, discarding the seeds. Fry for just 1 minute, then toss in the drained pasta, loosening with a little reserved cooking water, if needed. Season to perfection, divide between warm bowls, drizzle lightly with extra virgin olive oil and generously sprinkle over the pangrattato."

cloves of garlic. Cut the green part off the leeks (save for making stock or soup), then trim, wash and finely chop the white part. Peel the potatoes and chop into ½cm dice. Tie the thyme sprigs together., Melt half the butter in a large pan on a low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, then add the onions, garlic, celery, leeks, potatoes, bay leaves and thyme. Cover and sweat down for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Add all the mince to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Turn the heat up to medium-high and cook for 10 more minutes, or until the mince is browned all over, stirring occasionally., Pour in the wine, let it bubble and boil away, then finely grate in half the nutmeg. Stir in the flour for 1 minute, then pour in the milk. Season with sea salt and black pepper, cover with a scrunched-up sheet of wet greaseproof paper and transfer to the oven for 2 hours, or until thickened and beautifully tender., At this stage, the ragù might look like it’s split a little, but this is actually what we’re looking for – the milk in the sauce creates amazing ricotta-like curds as it cooks., Meanwhile, place a large heatproof baking dish on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil and the remaining butter. Peel, finely chop and add the remaining garlic, along with the chilli flakes, nettles (leaves only – wear gloves to protect your hands while you prep) and spinach – you’ll need to work in batches. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened., Allow to cool, then finely chop and return to the dish, spreading evenly over the base. Once done, divide the ragù in two, freezing one half for another day, once cool., Carefully drain the liquid from the remaining ragù into a bowl through a coarse sieve. Return the ragù to the pan, fish out and discard the thyme stalks and bay, then grate in half the cheese and stir well., Turn the oven up to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Use a piping bag or teaspoon to stuff the cannelloni tubes with the ragù, then arrange on top of the greens. Pour the sieved liquid over the top and grate over the remaining cheese. Trim and finely slice the mushrooms and scatter over the cannelloni., Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, then bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. For added colour, flash the dish under the grill for 5 minutes. Importantly, let it stand for 30 minutes before serving. Delicious with a seasonal salad for added crunch."

The pasta will seem very thin at this stage, but don't worry it will puff up as it cooks., Peel the garlic and put the whole cloves into a large pan of boiling salted water for 2 minutes (this will make the garlic creamy), then scoop out and finely chop, leaving the water on the heat., Clean and quarter the mushrooms, then very finely slice the truffle. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil into a cold pan, place on a medium heat, then add the garlic, strip in the thyme leaves and scatter in most of the truffle and the porcini., Toss occasionally over the heat while you carefully add the pasta to the boiling water to cook for 4½ minutes (if you’ve left the pasta to dry out, it will take a little longer)., Add the anchovies to the porcini pan – they’ll melt in – and toss together, then add a little pasta water to emulsify into a lovely mushroom sauce. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter., Using tongs, drag the pasta straight into the porcini pan, taking a little cooking water with it. Toss together, then finely grate in the cheese, and toss again., Scatter over the remaining truffle, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, and finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Simply delicious!"

  skin-on almonds","Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., To make your filling, wash the squash, carefully cut it in half lengthways and remove the seeds, then chop into eight big chunks and place in a large roasting tray., Add the whole ricotta, sprinkle over the chilli flakes and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then finely grate over half the nutmeg. Drizzle with oil and gently toss together. Roast for 1 hour., Crumble up the chestnuts, pick the sage leaves, toss both in a little oil, then sprinkle into the tray. Roast for another 15 minutes, or until the squash is tender and golden, and the ricotta is gnarly-looking., Finely grate the Parmesan into the tray, season and mash it all together, as chunky or smooth as you like. Leave to cool completely., Make the pasta dough in a food processor, blitzing the spinach and egg yolks together before adding the dry ingredients. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and pop into the fridge for 30 minutes., Divide the pasta in half, saving one half for another day. Cut the remaining piece in two (wrapping one piece back up momentarily), and roll out into sheets that are just 2mm thick – use a pasta machine, or do it by hand with a rolling pin., Cut into rectangles 15cm x 12cm. Spoon 2 tablespoons of filling along the length of each one, near the bottom edge, leaving 1.5cm at either end., Brush the exposed pasta with a damp brush, then roll up and pinch in the sides to seal and create cracker shapes., Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling to make 24 crackers in total. Transfer to semolina-dusted greaseproof paper as you go., For the sauce, melt the butter in a large frying pan, then, once foamy and starting to darken, squeeze in the clementine juice and swirl to create a creamy butter sauce. Season with pepper and keep warm over a very low heat until needed., Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water for 3 to 4 minutes, transferring it to the buttery sauce when cooked, with a splash of cooking water. Work in batches (the first will happily sit in the sauce while you cook the rest)., Finish with a grating of nutmeg and Parmesan, and a scattering of toasted, crushed almonds."

It’s cheesy, it’s gooey, and it’s packed with herby sautéed mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, streaky bacon and three types of cheese. If you want to go for the fully Betty effect, serve up with chipolata sausages alongside. ”",699,41.2g,18.6g,9.8g,1.3g,22.8g,63.2g,2.7g,"250                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                portobello mushrooms, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                sun-dried tomatoes in oil, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh thyme (15g), olive oil, 3                                                                                                                                                                rashers of                                                                                                                                                                higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon, 70                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                breadcrumbs, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh flat-leaf parsley (15g), 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried macaroni, 80                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter, 80                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                plain flour, 1                                                                                                                                                                litre                                                                                                                                                                whole milk, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Cheddar cheese, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Emmental cheese, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Gruyère cheese, higher-welfare chipolata sausages                                                                                                                                                                , optional","Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Finely slice the mushrooms and tomatoes, and pick the thyme leaves.

Repeat the layers, then top with the bacon breadcrumbs., Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden and bubbling.

It’s an absolute belter of a dish, and much simpler to make than you might think. It’s a real celebration of the juice and flavour of clams, and once you know how, it’s a brilliantly quick and easy dish that’ll hit the spot on the flavour front, every time.

Spoon into a piping bag and place in the fridge while you roll out your dough. Follow the rolling-out instructions, taking the pasta to 1mm thickness., Lay the sheets on a clean surface, then carefully pipe a ring of ricotta about 5cm wide, starting 2.5cm away from the edge of the pasta., Separate an egg and carefully drop the yolk into the middle of the ricotta circle – it should fit snugly. Start your next ring of ricotta 5cm away from where your first one ends, then repeat 4 times more., Brush the exposed pasta with water and carefully lay the second sheet of pasta over the top., Starting at one end, gently press the pasta around the outside of the filling, pushing out the air and sealing the edges. Using a 10cm round cutter, cut out a circle-shaped ravioli with the egg right in the middle., Check the edges are sealed – use a little more water to help, if needed. Place the ravioli on a large tray dusted with semolina, making sure they don’t touch and continue with the rest., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, then reduce the heat to a rolling simmer. Carefully lower in the ravioli, two or three at a time, and cook for 4 minutes, or until they float., Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. As soon as it foams, finely grate in the lemon zest and add a squeeze of juice plus a pinch of pepper., Remove the pasta with a slotted spoon straight into the butter sauce, adding a splash of pasta water and grating in the remaining Parmesan. Cook the next batch of ravioli, then add to the sauce., Dress the frisée with half the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of oil, tear in the prosciutto, then season with pepper and mix together., Divide the ravioli between your plates, arrange the frisée salad around it, then serve with a good grating of Parmesan."

Chop and add the ham, finely grate in the rest of your cheese, and pick, chop and add the rosemary leaves., Toss together well, then pack into the cake tin and place on a baking tray. Bake for 35 minutes, or until golden, crisp and cooked through., Leave the carbonara cake to sit for 3 minutes in the tin, then carefully and confidently run a knife around the rim and release it proudly on to a board. Great served with a fresh, zingy lemon-dressed salad on the side."

It’s a good staple for older kids to learn how to cook, as they can pair it with any flavours they like, or vegetables that are in season. We think kids will like the way the asparagus and courgettes are peeled to resemble the pasta ribbons (we do too). Peeling is a useful skill that even little children can learn, while older children can master cooking and assembling. You could make your own pasta if you have a machine – it’s a fun activity for everyone to get involved in., Fill a large saucepan with water, add a big pinch of sea salt and bring it to the boil., Peel the vegetables into ribbons with a speed peeler. Set aside., Break the eggs into a big mixing bowl, add the crème fraîche and Parmesan cheese, and finely grate in the lemon zest.

Add your oil and liquidise until you’ve got a vivid green purée, the same consistency as double cream. If it’s a bit too dry, add a splash of the cooking water. Have a taste, season with sea salt and black pepper, then put aside., Bring the water back to boil, and cook the pasta according to the packet instructions., Drain and return the pasta to the pan, add the sauce and allow it to simmer over a medium-low heat for 30 seconds., As it comes back to the boil, remove from the heat and finely grate in the Parmesan. Be quick, so your pasta doesn’t overcook, then check the balance of cheese, salt and pepper., Finely grate over extra Parmesan, then serve on a big platter and eat as soon as possible."

It also contains two of your five-a-day (bonus!), and the nutty-flavoured wholewheat pasta is much higher in fibre than the white refined stuff (double bonus!), so is a fantastic switch to make. The aubergine takes on the most amazing texture, the capers and pecorino add a lovely saltiness to the sweet tomato sauce and the chilli flakes give it a lovely warmth. ”",409,13g,3.9g,8.4g,1.5g,16.3g,60.6g,10.1g,"2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    aubergines, 3                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                dried oregano, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                dried chilli flakes, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                baby capers, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                red wine vinegar, 1 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                quality plum tomatoes, 320                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried wholewheat spaghetti, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                pecorino cheese, extra virgin olive oil","Chop the aubergines into rough 2cm chunks. Place into a colander in the sink, sprinkle with sea salt to draw out the moisture, then set aside for around 20 minutes., Peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick the basil leaves and finely slice the stalks., Rinse the aubergine and pat dry with kitchen paper, then place into a large bowl with the oregano, chilli flakes, a splash of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Toss together well., Drizzle a splash of olive oil into a large frying pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the aubergines in a single layer, and fry for 5 to 8 minutes, or until softened and golden, stirring occasionally – you may need to do this in batches., Add another splash of olive oil, followed by the garlic, capers and basil stalks, then cook for a further 2 minutes, or until golden., Stir in the vinegar and the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of a spoon. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thick and glossy., Cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling salted water for 8 minutes or until al dente, which means that it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of bite and firmness to it., Drain the spaghetti, reserving a cupful of the cooking water, then add a good splash of the reserved water to the aubergine sauce., Finely grate in half the cheese and tear in most of the reserved basil leaves. Add a lug of extra virgin olive oil, then season to taste., Add the spaghetti to the sauce and toss well, adding an extra splash of the reserved cooking water to loosen, if needed., Divide between bowls, grate over the remaining cheese and finish with the remaining basil scattered on top."

Cover with about 1cm of oil and let them sit on a really low heat – almost so they’re coddling – for about 10 minutes., Once they’ve softened, and the oil has taken a lot of the chilli flavour, pour away most of the oil (save it in a jar for a lovely chilli oil)., Peel and finely slice the garlic, then add to the pan with the anchovies and oregano. Fry gently for a few minutes., Stir in the tinned tomatoes or passata, then bring everything to the boil. Be careful not to break the chillies — this will make the sauce very hot!, Meanwhile, cook your pasta according to the packet instructions and get started on the pangrattato., Tear the bread into a food processor and blitz with a pinch of sea salt to make fine crumbs., Peel and crush the garlic, then add to a large pan with a good lug of oil  on a medium heat. Allow it to flavour the oil, then chop and add a few pinches of dried chilli., After a minute or two add the breadcrumbs, then toss so everything gets coated in the garlic oil. Fry for 5 to 7 minutes, or until you’ve got crisp, golden breadcrumbs., Take the pan off the heat, leaving the breadcrumbs in there to stay warm., Drain the pasta, then add to the large pan with your sauce.

Run the bunch of thyme under a hot tap for 3 seconds to reawaken it, then shake dry and strip the leaves into the oil., Peel the garlic, then finely slice it with the chilli and add to the bowl. Finely grate in the lemon zest, add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and mix together., Lay the cherry tomatoes in a 30cm x 40cm baking tray. Rub the flavoured oil all over the ricotta and place in the centre of the tray, then gently rub the remaining oil over the tomatoes., Add a splash of water to the tray, place in the oven and roast for 45 minutes, then remove. With 10 minutes to go, cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions., Lift the ricotta out of the tray, then shake the tomatoes off the vines, discarding the stalks. Add half a mug of pasta water to the tray and gently shake to loosen all the sticky goodness from the base., Drain the spaghetti and toss straight into the tray with a squeeze of lemon juice, season to perfection, then break that beautiful ricotta over the top., Sprinkle over the rocket, toss together well, then serve. My missus likes this with a little drizzle of balsamic, too."

Take care not to burn them., If using salted anchovies, rinse and dry them. Run your thumb gently along the backbone to release it, and you should be able to easily pull it out. If using anchovies in oil, drain them., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, put in the broccoli and cook until just tender. Lift out (retaining the cooking water for the pasta), and put into some iced water to stop the cooking and keep the bright green colour. Drain the broccoli from its iced water and pat dry., Heat the garlic oil in a pan, add the anchovies and stir with a wooden spoon to ‘melt’ them, taking care not to let them burn.

Put the beef brisket, bones, chicken, unpeeled onion and celery in a large stockpot. Halve the carrot lengthways, and add to the pan with a pinch of sea salt., Pour over 2 litres of cold water, or enough to cover. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 4 hours, skimming occasionally., Meanwhile, prepare the pasta dough. Blend the ingredients in a food processor (or combine by hand) until they come together and you have a soft but firm dough. Lightly dust with flour, wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest for 30 minutes., For the filling, heat a little oil in a saucepan, season the mince and fry until cooked through. Drain any water and leave to cool., Transfer to a food processor with the prosciutto, mortadella and nutmeg. Finely grate in the Parmesan, then blitz (or finely chop together by hand) until you have a very fine mixture., You’ll need to make the pasta in stages so it doesn’t dry out. Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Use a pasta machine (or a floured rolling pin) to roll out 1 piece (covering the rest with clingfilm or a tea towel ) into a long, flat, very thin 6cm-wide strip. Slice into 3cm squares., To make the tortellini, lightly dust a tray with flour. Place a ¼ of a teaspoon of filling in the middle of a square of pasta., Fold the pasta over into a triangle, and press at the edges to seal. Wind the folded edge around the tip of your middle finger and press the ends to form a ring., Continue until you have used all the rolled-out dough, then roll the next piece and keep going until it’s all used up. You can make meatballs or ragù with any leftover filling., To serve, strain the stock and discard the meat and vegetables. Taste and adjust the salt, if it’s necessary., Bring to the boil, add the tortellini and cook for about 3 minutes, or till they rise to the surface. Ladle into bowls and serve with extra Parmesan."

Once it's relaxed for 30 minutes, roll the sheets out to 2mm thick., Set up the fettuccine attachment on your pasta machine and gently run through each pasta sheet, placing on a semolina dusted tray as you go. Or, if making by hand, loosely roll up the pasta sheets, cut into strips just over ½cm wide, then use your fingertips to shake out and separate into strands., When ready, cook the fettuccine in a large pan of boiling salted water for 1 to 2 minutes, or until al dente., Meanwhile, gently heat all the cream in a large frying pan on a low heat, then separate the egg and whisk the yolk into the pan (save the white for another day). Finely grate and gently whisk in the Parmesan, then season with sea salt and black pepper., Using tongs, drag the pasta straight into the sauce, taking a little cooking water with it. Toss together, adding extra splashes of cooking water to loosen into a lovely, silky sauce, if needed., Plate up with fine gratings of truffle or nutmeg and a good grating of Parmesan, drizzle with a little truffle oil and serve right away."

The flavour combo here is mega-simple, but when you put them together, something magical happens. Let the tomatoes ripen naturally out of the fridge – the warmth will ensure all those lovely flavours and juices are at their best and ready to flow. Tomatoes are a source of vitamin C, a nutrient our bodies need for so many different things, including immune function and keeping our energy levels up., Cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling salted water for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente, which means that it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of bite and firmness to it., On a large chopping board, chop the tomatoes. Bash the olives and tear out the stones, then add the olives to the pile of tomatoes., Pick the basil leaves, reserving the smaller ones for later and throw the rest onto the pile., Peel, chop and add the garlic to the pile, then run your knife back and forth through all of the ingredients, chopping and mixing as you go, until you get a rough-looking salsa., Add a good couple of lugs of oil, the vinegar and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and keep chopping and mixing until well combined., Scoop out and reserve a cupful of the pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti in a colander., Pop the spaghetti in a large bowl, scrape in the salsa dressing, adding a splash of the reserved cooking water, if needed, to make a lovely loose sauce., Sprinkle over the reserved baby basil leaves and add a grating of hard Italian cheese before serving."

To loosen it a little, squeeze over the lemon juice and a few splashes of oil. If it is still quite thick, add a splash of water until it is spoonable, like yoghurt., Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions until al dente. Drain in a colander then cool under cold running water to prevent it from cooking any further and going mushy. Return the pasta to the pan, add the pesto and stir well to combine., Chop the remaining garlic. Heat a splash of oil in a pan, add the garlic and breadcrumbs, then cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the breadcrumbs are crunchy and golden., Line up 12 clean, empty jam jars or containers and fill them with the pesto pasta. Scatter the breadcrumbs on top then grate over the remaining goat’s cheese. Screw on the lids and you’re ready for your picnic."

Add the thyme, mushrooms, sea salt and black pepper and fry for 5 to 8 minutes., Stir in the ham or turkey, and continue to cook for 5 minutes, so everything gets some colour. Stir in the crème fraîche and remove the pan from the heat. Drain the pasta once cooked – saving a mugful of the cooking water – and let it cool slightly. Toss the pasta with a little oil, then stir into the sauce. Add a little cooking water to loosen, if needed., Stir in the spinach, add a good grating of Parmesan, squeeze in the lemon juice, then season to taste before serving."

Place the flour on a board or in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Beat the egg until smooth, then pour it into the well., Using the tips of your fingers, gradually mix the egg with the flour until combined., Knead the bits of dough into one smooth lump. You can also do this step in a food processor – just whiz the flour and egg until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip onto a work surface and bring together with your hands., Knead the dough to develop the gluten; this makes your pasta springy instead of flabby when you cook it. There’s no secret to kneading – you just have to bash the dough around a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, stretching it and squashing it again. Stop when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky. Wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes., It’s not the end of the world if you haven’t got a pasta machine, just use a rolling pin. The problem you’ll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces. You’ll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than you’ll get from a machine., If using a machine, make sure it’s firmly clamped to a clean, long work surface. Dust the surface with flour, then take a lump of dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips., Set the pasta machine at its widest setting and roll the dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks., Click the machine down a setting and roll the dough through again. Fold the dough in half, click the machine back up to the widest setting and roll it through again. Repeat 5 or 6 times., Work the dough through all the machine’s settings, from the widest to the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the dough with flour every time you run it through. When you reach the narrowest setting, fold the dough in half, then in half again, then once more into a squarish piece of dough., Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll through the settings for the last time, you should get a silky, rectangular sheet of pasta with straight edges., For the lasagne sheets needed in these recipes, keep rolling the pasta until it’s somewhere between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card., Cut the pasta into 10cm x 20cm sheets. It dries faster than you might think, so don’t wait more than a minute or two to cut it. Lay a damp tea towel on top of the pasta to help prevent it drying out., Peel and finely slice the garlic. Peel all the onions, finely chop 3 and cut the remaining onion into wedges. Trim and finely chop the celery and carrots, and pick and finely chop the rosemary., Heat a good lug of oil in a large, deep saucepan. Fry the garlic over a medium heat for 1 minute, or until golden. Add the finely chopped onions to the pan with the carrot and celery. Fry over a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the veg are soft but not coloured., Add the rosemary, oregano, tomatoes, wine and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and bring to the boil, breaking up the tomatoes with a spoon. Reduce the heat and leave to simmer for 1 hour, or until thickened., Chop up the meat or pulse in a food processor, then stir into the ragù for the final 15 minutes, or until the meat is heated through and the sauce is thick, rich and glossy. Stir the sauce regularly and loosen with a splash of boiling water from the kettle if it’s too thick for your liking., When the ragù is almost there, preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and start your béchamel sauce. Pour the milk into a large saucepan over a low heat. Add the peppercorns and the remaining onion and gently bring almost to the boil., Melt the butter in a second saucepan. Stir in the flour to create a paste and cook over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently., Whisk in the hot milk, a ladleful at a time (discard the onion and peppercorns). Gently bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until you have a thick, smooth sauce. Grate and stir in most of the Parmesan and season to taste., Grease a large rectangular or round baking dish with a little oil and bring a pan of salted water to the boil., Add the lasagne sheets to the pan, a few sheets at a time, and cook for 1 minute or so per batch. Remove the pasta with tongs and spread out on a clean tea towel to drain., Drape a single layer of lasagne over the base of the baking dish. Spread over a thin layer of ragù, top with another layer of pasta and then spread over a thin layer of béchamel sauce., Repeat as many times as you can (6 to 8, ideally), finishing with a layer of pasta topped with béchamel sauce., Tear over the mozzarella, then finish with the remaining grated Parmesan and a drizzle of oil. Pick and scatter over the basil leaves., Bake the lasagne in the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden on top and bubbling at the edges. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving."

Scoop in three-quarters of your pea mixture to heat through., Whisk the egg and yoghurt together well. When the pasta’s done, reserving a mugful of cooking water, drain the pasta and toss straight into the pea pan, mixing well, then take the pan off the heat (this is very important, otherwise the egg will scramble when you add it, and we don’t want that)., Pour in the egg mixture and toss until evenly coated, silky and creamy, loosening with cooking water if needed., Taste and season to perfection, and serve topped with the remaining pea mixture and the crispy bacon. It might be skinny, but it’s beautifully light and delicious. Enjoy!"

Beat the eggs in a large bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan. Season with a little salt and a good twist of pepper. Whisk well, then stir in your pasta., To cook the frittata, heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a 26cm non-stick ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Add the frittata mixture and cook for about 5 minutes, or until crisp underneath, then place in the oven for another 5 minutes, or until firm. Carefully flip the frittata onto a large plate, then slide it back into the pan and return it to the oven for a further 5 minutes, or until crisp underneath. Serve with an extra grating of Parmesan., If you’ve got about 400g of leftover cooked pasta that is already coated in sauce, you can swap that in for an easy twist on my basic recipe. Or try making a pizzaiola pasta frittata – make the basic pasta frittata (I like to use fusilli, but use whatever shape you have), then serve by slicing and layering over 6 ripe cherry tomatoes and 40g of fontina cheese. Scatter over a few fresh basil leaves, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan., If it’s springtime, make the basic recipe extra special by adding peas and pancetta. Heat 1½ tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a 26cm non-stick ovenproof frying pan. Peel, finely slice and add 1 onion, then sweat for a few minutes. Very finely slice 6 higher-welfare slices of pancetta and add to the pan for a further 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 200g of peas, pour in 400ml of hot water, then turn the heat up to high and bring to the boil. Leave it to simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated, then cool. Make the basic pasta frittata mixture, finely chop and add the leaves from 4 sprigs of fresh mint,, squeeze in the juice from 1 lemon, then stir in the cooled pea mixture. Cook your frittata as above, and serve with an extra grating of Parmesan., Tip: Pasta frittata is delicious served hot or cold – I like to wrap it up to have as a snack during a long walk or a day out foraging in the woods or, take it out for a picnic."

Meanwhile, finely slice the garlic and chilli, then roughly chop the anchovies and tomatoes. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil (use the oil from the tin of tuna for added flavour, if you can) in a frying pan over a medium heat, then add the garlic, chilli, anchovies and capers. Fry for 2 minutes, then add the tomatoes and toss well., Reserving some of the cooking water, drain the bucatini and add to the sauce. Toss well over the heat until lovely and glossy, adding a splash of the cooking water to loosen, if needed. Flake in the tuna, then add some lemon juice and most of the rocket. Toss well to warm the tuna through and wilt the rocket, then season carefully with salt and more lemon juice. Serve with a drizzle of oil, and a scattering of the reserved rocket."

Finely slice the pancetta, shallots and chilli, then chop the squash into 1cm cubes. Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the pancetta and fry for 1 minute, then stir in the shallots, chilli and rosemary leaves. Cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes, then stir in the squash and pour in the hot stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 20 minutes, or until the squash is tender and the liquid has reduced slightly., Meanwhile, cook the penne in a large pan of boiling salted water until very al dente – it’ll continue cooking in the sauce so it’s important to undercook it. Reserving some of the cooking water, drain the penne and add to the sauce. Stir gently, adding a splash of the cooking water to loosen, if needed, then cook for a further 2 minutes to let the penne soak up all those beautiful flavours. Finely grate in the Parmesan and stir until deliciously creamy. Serve with a twist of pepper and an extra grating of Parmesan."

Very finely slice the onion, pepper and half the Parma ham. Finely slice the chilli. Quarter the tomato, cut out the seeds and finely dice the flesh. Finely chop the parsley leaves., Put the finely sliced Parma ham into a large dry frying pan over a high heat and cook for 5 minutes, or until crispy. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain. Cook the taglierini in a large pan of boiling salted water until al dente. Meanwhile, return the frying pan to a medium-high heat with 3 tablespoons of oil. Add the onion, pepper and chilli and cook for a minute or so. Roughly slice the remaining Parma ham and add to the pan, stir in most of the parsley leaves and season lightly with salt and pepper., Reserving some of the cooking water, drain the taglierini and add to the sauce. Add the lemon juice, diced tomato and a good grating of Parmesan. Toss well over the heat until lovely and glossy, adding a splash of the cooking water to loosen, if needed. Divide between your plates, sprinkle over the crispy Parma ham and add an extra grating of Parmesan. Finish by sprinkling over the lemon zest and the rest of the chopped parsley."

Stir in the pancetta, then cook for 4 minutes, or until it starts to crisp up., Pick out and discard the garlic from the pan, then, reserving some of the cooking water, drain and add the spaghetti. Toss well over the heat so it really soaks up all that lovely flavour, then remove the pan from the heat., Add a splash of the cooking water and toss well, season with pepper, then pour in the egg mixture – the pan will help to cook the egg gently, rather than scrambling it. Toss well, adding more cooking water until it’s lovely and glossy., Serve with a grating of Parmesan and an extra twist of pepper."

the rosemary leaves, then finely slice the bacon or pancetta., Put a large saucepan on a medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil., Add the bacon, rosemary, garlic and veg, then cook with the lid ajar for 10 to 15 minutes, or until softened and just turning golden, stirring occasionally., Stir in the mince, turn the heat up to high and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until browned all over,stirring and breaking it up with a spoon as you go., Add the tomatoes, tomato purée, vinegar and bay leaves., Fill and boil the kettle., Crumble in the stock cube and pour in 400ml boiling water., Stir well, turn the heat up to high and bring to the boil., Season with pepper, reduce to a low heat, then cover and simmer for around 1 hour, stirring occasionally., Remove the lid and continue cooking for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thickened and reduced. Meanwhile..., Re-fill and boil the kettle., Carefully fill a large pot three quarters of the way up with boiling water, add a tiny pinch of salt and bring back to the boil., Add the spaghetti and cook according to packet instructions – you want to cook your pasta until it is al dente. This translates as ‘to the tooth’ and means that it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of a bite and firmness to it. Use the timings on the packet instructions as a guide, but try some just before the time is up to make sure it’s perfectly cooked., Using a microplane, finely grate the Parmesan cheese onto a clean chopping board (if using)., Once the spaghetti is done, ladle out and reserve a cup of cooking water and keep it to one side, then drain in a colander over the sink., Taste the Bolognese sauce and season with a little more pepper or vinegar, if you think it needs it., Carefully pick out and discard the bay leaves., Put half the sauce into a container, leave to cool, then freeze for another day., Stir the spaghetti into the remaining sauce, adding a splash of pasta water to loosen, if needed., Divide between bowls and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese (if using), then serve."

Grease a 30cm x 25cm baking dish., Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water, for slightly less time than given on the packet so it’s just undercooked. Drain and run under cold water to stop it from cooking further. Return to the saucepan and coat with a drizzle of olive oil., Meanwhile, roughly chop the leeks. Put the butter in a frying pan and gently fry the leeks for 10 minutes or until they’re soft. Peel, mince and add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the stock and wine, then cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until almost all the liquid has evaporated. Add the peas, stir and cook for 30 seconds., Dice the cooked chicken., To the drained pasta, add the leek mixture, chicken, milk and two-thirds of the ricotta. Mix gently to combine and season with salt and pepper., Spoon the pasta mixture into the baking dish. Top with the remaining ricotta, grate over the Parmesan and drizzle with olive oil, if you like. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes or until piping hot and starting to crisp up on top."

Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Place a large shallow pan over a medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil, the onion, garlic and chilli flakes (if using) and fry for 5 to 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat up to high and pour in the chopped tomatoes. Tear the leaves from the basil stalks, keeping a few pretty ones aside for later, and stir them into the sauce. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes., Meanwhile, place a large pan of water on to boil. Once boiling, add a good pinch of salt followed by the pasta. Cook according to the packet instructions, draining just before it’s done – it’ll finish cooking in the oven., Drain the tuna and stir through the sauce, making sure you don’t break it up too much. Season with a tiny pinch of salt and a generous pinch of black pepper. When the pasta is ready, drain and tip straight into the sauce. Toss and coat the pasta in the sauce, then transfer to an ovenproof baking dish (roughly 25cm x 30cm)., Coarsely grate the cheese and sprinkle over the pasta. Arrange the reserved basil leaves on top, then sprinkle lightly with black pepper. Drizzle lightly with oil, then place in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. Leave to stand for 5 minutes, then serve with a nice salad."

                            , for grating","Strip and finely chop the rosemary leaves and finely chop the bacon., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large casserole pan on a high heat. Once hot, add the rosemary and bacon and fry for 2 minutes, or until the bacon starts to crisp up, stirring regularly., Add all the minced meat, using a wooden spoon to break it up as you go. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for at least 10 minutes, or until all the liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally., Place the coarse grater attachment in your food processor (or you could use a box grater instead) and grate the Cheddar, then tip into a bowl., Replace the grater with the regular blade. Trim and halve the carrots, then add to the processor and blitz to roughly the same size as the mince. Peel and halve the onions, add them to the carrot and blitz again., Tip into the pan with the mince while you get on with blitzing and adding the celery. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the vegetables start to soften, stirring regularly., Next, add the tomato purée and plum tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon. Fill each of the tins with water and tip into the pan.
Give everything a good stir and reduce the heat to low. Leave to simmer around 2 hours, or until thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally., While that ticks away, make your white sauce. Trim, wash and finely slice the leeks, then add to a pan along with 2 tablespoons of oil and the bay leaves. Stir well and season with a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Reduce the heat to low and cook for 30 minutes, or until sweet and softened, adding splashes of water, if needed., Add the flour and stir well to coat, then gradually add the milk, stirring continuously. Turn the heat up to medium, bring to the boil, then reduce to low and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened, stirring regularly., Carefully transfer the sauce to the food processor and blitz until smooth and silky. Add half the grated cheese and finely grate over half the nutmeg and mix well. Season to taste., Once the ragù is ready, preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Season the ragù to taste, then transfer half into freezer bags, portioning up as appropriate for your family. Allow to cool to room temperature, then pop in the freezer for another day. It’s a good idea to freeze them flat so that you can reheat them quickly and easily. It’s also a good idea to label and date them to avoid a game of freezer roulette in a few weeks' time!, To build your lasagne, spoon a quarter of the ragù into a large deep ovenproof dish (roughly 25cm by 30cm) and spread it out evenly., Spoon over a quarter of the white sauce, then snap over some lasagne sheets, making sure they completely cover the sauce in one layer. Repeat this 3 times, finishing with a layer of white sauce., Sprinkle over the remaining cheese and bake the lasagne in the oven for 45 minutes or until golden and bubbling., Remove the lasagne from the oven and leave to sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Delicious served with a fresh green salad."

season with sea salt and bring to a rolling boil. Swiftly plunge the lobster head first into the water, place the lid on and cook for 8 minutes (or slightly less if you’re using 2 small ones). Remove and leave to cool., Peel and finely chop the onions and garlic. Get yourself a large ovenproof casserole pan (ideally 30cm wide and 10cm deep) that you want to serve up in. Put the butter into the pan on a medium heat, add the onions, garlic, saffron, cayenne and anchovies and cook for 10 minutes., Turn the heat up to high, add the wine and cook it away, then reduce the heat back to medium and stir in the flour, followed by the milk and mustard. Mix well and simmer for 10 minutes while you prepare the lobster., Twist the lobster head and body apart – importantly, shake out all the tasty juice and bits from the head into the sauce. Squeeze the tail shell in until you hear it crack, then rip it open the other way to expose all that lovely tail meat. Rip the claws off the body, then use a rolling pin on a board to crack them open and poke out any meat you can find., Roughly chop all the meat, reserving the tail, shell and head. Scroll down to the bottom of the page for our helpful video on how to prepare your lobster., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to packet instructions, then drain, reserving a little cooking water., Remove the sauce from the heat, stir in the pasta and lobster meat and grate in the Cheddar and Gruyère. Mix well, taste and correct the seasoning – you don’t want the sauce to be super-thick now, so loosen it with a little cooking water if needed, remembering that it will thicken as it bakes., Finely grate over the Parmesan (I didn’t do it in the picture, but you can add a sprinkling of breadcrumbs before the cheese too, if you like). For a bit of fun, pop the lobster head and tail into the pan at either end. Cook in the oven for about 35 minutes, or until golden, bubbling and delicious., Serve with a smile, a big seasonal salad, and a glass of cold Soave., Jamie's Tip A few freshly picked rosemary leaves tossed in a bit of olive oil and sprinkled over the top of the last 10 minutes of cooking will be delicious."

                 fresh basil","Put all the minced meat into your largest pan on a high heat with a good lug of oil and a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Cook for 20 minutes, or until golden, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the garlic, onions, carrots and celery. When the mince has got a good colour, add all the chopped veg and cook for a further 10 minutes, then add the Chianti and cook it away., Pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, and add half a tin’s worth of water. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 1 hour, or until the meat is tender and the sauce is super-thick. Remove from the heat to cool, then finely grate and stir in the Parmesan., Now it’s time to assemble your pasta. Following the instructions for making the pasta dough, roll out your dough to 1mm thick, then make your ravioli about 7cm square. I work with a quarter of the pasta at a time to give more control., Use a heaped teaspoon of filling in the centre of each one, sealing the edges with a light brushing of water and pushing out the air – you should get about 50 to 60 ravioli from this amount of pasta. Place them on a semolina-dusted tray as you go., Freeze the remaining Bolognese (you’ll have roughly half left) for a rainy day, or make a double batch of pasta and freeze as ravioli – you can cook them from frozen in the sauce., Put a pan of salted water on to boil for the pasta., For the sauce, peel and roughly chop the garlic and deseed and finely chop the chillies. Place a pan on a medium heat, add a lug of oil and the garlic and chilli, and fry for a few minutes, or until very lightly golden. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, or until thickened and reduced, then remove from the heat and blitz until smooth with a stick blender. Taste and season to perfection, then place back on a very low heat., Cook the ravioli in the boiling salted water for 3 minutes, or until tender, then use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the sauce. Gently toss together and simmer for another couple of minutes, then divide between warm bowls, scatter with baby basil leaves and serve with a few extra gratings of Parmesan, if you like."

Take it off the hob, leave to cool, then carefully squeeze out the excess water., Pop the leaves in a blender with 75g of the ricotta and blitz to a purée. Transfer it to a large bowl along with the remaining ricotta and eggs, grate in the Parmesan and whisk vigorously, until light and airy., Using a large metal spoon, fold the flour into the ricotta mixture, adding a little more if it’s too sticky – it needs to be soft and moist., Sprinkle a 5mm layer of semolina flour over a baking tray, and fill a piping bag with the ricotta mixture, cutting a 1.5cm opening. Pipe long strips of the gnudi mixture down the tray, about 1.5cm apart., Sprinkle the strips with another thick layer of semolina flour, then cut them into 2-3cm pieces, making sure the gnudi are well coated in the flour. Cover the tray with clingfilm and pop it in the fridge overnight., To cook your gnudi, remove the tray from the fridge and let it to come up to room temperature., Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan over a low heat and pick in most of the reserved basil leaves. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the butter starts to bubble and the leaves have crisped up. Finely grate in the zest of the lemon and season well with sea salt and black pepper. Transfer to a bowl and set aside., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil over a medium heat and gently lower the gnudi into the pan with a slotted spoon. Once they float to the surface, they’re cooked – this should take about 1 minute., Remove them with a slotted spoon and gently toss them in the lemon butter. Divide between 6 bowls and grate over the pecorino and serve with the rest of the basil leaves on top. Halve the zested lemon and serve on the side for squeezing over."

When it comes together, roll the pasta out thinly and evenly and place on a surface well-floured with Tipo 00 flour. Set aside., Pick the soft yellow parts of the courgette flower and chop them up small, being careful not to crush them. Add to a bowl with the ricotta., Pick the mint leaves and finely chop them and the chilli, and add to the bowl., Season the mixture with sea salt and black pepper, mix well and spoon into a piping bag with a 1cm nozzle. Pipe teaspoon-sized blobs in a line on the bottom half of the pasta sheet, 3-4cm apart., Brush the edges around the filling with a little water, then fold the top half of the pasta down onto the half with the filling. Squeeze out any air and press down to seal the edges. With a crinkly pasta cutter, trim into separate ravioli and place on a tray well-floured with Tipo 00 flour., To make the sauce, slice the tomatoes in half and squeeze the seeds into a sieve over a bowl. Place the empty tomato halves cut-side down in a wide saucepan and add the juice from the seeds. Discard the seeds themselves., Add enough water to the pan to come half way up the sides of the tomatoes, and season well with sea salt and a little black pepper., Pick and reserve the basil leaves, then add the whole basil stalks to the pan, cover with a lid and place over a high heat. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and cook for 1 to 2 minutes., Remove the lid and pinch the skins from the tomatoes with a pair of tongs. Discard the skins, then mash the soft tomatoes with a potato masher. Cook, stirring occasionally, until it reduces to a lovely fresh tomato sauce. Fish out the basil stalks and discard. Tear up most of the basil leaves and add to the pan with a good splash of olive oil., Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 5 minutes, until they have all risen to the top, then use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the pan of tomato sauce. Gently turn the pasta to be coated in the sauce and leave for a minute for the pasta to absorb some of it., Spoon the ravioli and sauce onto 4 plates and top with some basil leaves and grate over a little pecorino."

Put the spinach and a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over a low heat. Add the nutmeg, season with sea salt and black pepper, cover and leave to sweat. Help the kids to stir it occasionally until the spinach has cooked down. Place in a bowl and set to one side to cool a little., Dice the onion and squash the garlic. In the same pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil and gently sweat the onion until soft., Scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands and add the garlic and bay leaf. Pick in a few basil leaves and grate in the zest of the lemon half, then let it gently simmer for 20 minutes until the sauce has thickened. Season with salt and pepper., Have the kids squeeze the moisture out of the spinach into the bowl. Place the spinach on a board so you can chop it up. Return the spinach to the liquid in the bowl., Beat the egg and grate 2 teaspoons of Parmesan cheese. Get the kids to stir the ricotta, egg and Parmesan into the spinach. Season to taste., Sit a piping bag in a jug, fold its edges over the rim, then spoon in the spinach mixture. Have the kids help pipe the mixture into the cannelloni tubes and lay them in a 20cm x 25cm oven dish., Spread the tomato sauce over the cannelloni. Pick the remaining basil leaves and scatter most of them over the tomato sauce. Slice the mozzarella and lay the slices on top, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and season., Place in the oven and cook for 35 to 40 minutes or till the top is golden and the pasta tender (if the top browns too fast, cover the dish with foil).

Set the leafy tops and inner hearts aside to make a salad later., Place a frying pan over a medium heat and add a good glug of olive oil. Add the chopped fennel and garlic, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until soft., Finely chop the parsley stalks and add to the pan with the chilli flakes, cinnamon and fennel seeds to the pan and fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Finely grate in the zest from your 2 lemons (reserve the lemons) and add the tinned tomatoes. Sit the cherry tomatoes, vines and all, on top to poach. Cover, reduce the heat to low and leave to simmer for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to packet instructions., While the pasta and sauce are cooking away, crack on with the salad. Push the reserved fennel hearts and one of the zested lemons through the thinnest slicing attachment on your food processor – or use a knife or a mandolin (always use the guard). Tip into a bowl and season with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Add the reserved fennel tops and gently toss with your fingers. Put aside until you’re ready to serve., Check the tomato sauce – it should look rich and glossy and the tomatoes should be soft and squashy. Carefully pick out and discard the vine, leaving the tomatoes in the pan. Gently stir in the brown crabmeat and let it heat up., Finely chop the parsley leaves., Drain the pasta, reserving a cupful of cooking water, then gently fold it through the ragù with the white crabmeat and the chopped parsley, adding a little of the reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce if needed., Serve the pasta on a lovely big platter with the fennel salad bang on top so you can mix and toss the two together as you serve. Chop the remaining lemon into wedges and serve on the side for squeezing over. The mix of flavours is a knockout!"

Tip out onto a flour-dusted surface and knead for 3 to 5 minutes, or until smooth., Cut the dough into four pieces, then carefully press a portion out flat with your fingertips and start to roll it out using a pasta machine. Start at the widest setting and roll the dough through it, lightly dusting with the rice flour if it sticks. Roll the pasta through the widest setting a second time, then click the machine down a setting and roll the dough through again., Now, start clicking the settings down, rolling the pasta through each setting twice – gluten-free pasta isn’t as elastic as standard pasta, so make sure you avoid using the two narrowest settings, otherwise it may rip. Once you have a thin sheet of pasta (about 2mm thick), set aside on a flour-dusted surface and cover with a damp tea towel to avoid it drying out, then continue with the remaining dough., Now’s the time to transform your dough into whichever variety of pasta you like. If you want to make tagliatelle, roll the pasta through the tagliatelle setting on your pasta machine, or use a sharp knife to slice the pasta sheets lengthways into long strips (roughly 7mm thick), placing on a flour-dusted tray as you go. To cook, place in a pan of boiling salted water for around 3 minutes, or until al dente, then serve how you like it."

Slice the courgette at an angle, roughly 1cm thick – you want the pieces to be about the same size and shape as the penne., Pick and chop the rosemary leaves, then slice the mackerel 1cm thick (removing the skin, if you like)., Put the onions and courgettes into a large frying pan on a medium heat with a lug of oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, stirring occasionally., After 5 minutes, add the rosemary and mackerel and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until nice and golden, tossing occasionally., Meanwhile, whisk the eggs and milk together, then finely grate in the Parmesan., Reserving a cupful of cooking water, drain the pasta and toss it into the mackerel pan., Take the pan off the heat for a few seconds and stir in a good splash of the reserved water to cool it down (this is really important, because if you add your eggs when the pan’s still screaming hot, the heat will simply scramble them – you want the sauce to be silky smooth)., Quickly pour in the egg mixture and shake and stir together until thickened, silky and evenly coated, then plate up and serve with an extra grating of Parmesan, a good pinch of pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, if you like."

If using fresh, cut the tomatoes in half, then roughly chop them or carefully open the tins of tomatoes., Put a saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the onion, then cook for around 7 minutes, or until soft and lightly golden., Stir in the garlic and basil stalks for a few minutes, then add the fresh or tinned tomatoes and the vinegar., Season with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper, then continue cooking for around 15 minutes, stirring occasionally., Stir in the chopped basil leaves, then reduce to low and leave to tick away. Meanwhile…, Carefully fill a large pot three-quarters of the way up with boiling water, add a tiny pinch of salt and bring back to the boil., Add the spaghetti and cook according to packet instructions – you want to cook your pasta until it is al dente. This translates as ‘to the tooth’ and means that it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of a bite and firmness to it. Use the timings on the packet instructions as a guide, but try some just before the time is up to make sure it’s perfectly cooked., Once the pasta is done, ladle out and reserve a cup of the cooking water and keep it to one side, then drain in a colander over the sink and tip the spaghetti back into the pot., Stir the spaghetti into the sauce, adding a splash of the pasta water to loosen, if needed., Serve with the reserved basil leaves sprinkled over the top and use a microplane to finely grate the Parmesan cheese, then sprinkle over., PRINT THIS RECIPE (UK)

Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Rub the duck all over with olive oil, sea salt and black pepper. Put into a snug-fitting roasting tray and roast for 2 hours, or until golden and cooked through, then remove the duck to a board and set the tray aside for later., Peel the onions, garlic and celery, then finely chop and place in a large, wide pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, remove the duck skin and keep to one side (wear clean rubber gloves!), then shred the meat off the bones. Pour most of the Chianti into the pan and let it reduce for 10 to 15 minutes, then stir in the shredded duck meat., Stir the remaining splash of wine into the roasting tray and scrape all the lovely, crispy bits from the bottom, then pour into the pan. Scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands, then add 2 tins’ worth of water., Stir in the raisins, strip in the rosemary leaves and add the bay leaves, then simmer for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until thickened and reduced – if you’ve got any Parmesan rind, throw that in too for an added flavour dimension (just remember to take it out before serving!)., Meanwhile, peel the garlic and place in a food processor with the reserved duck skin. Tear in the bread, strip in the thyme leaves, then blitz until fine. Tip into a frying pan on a medium heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil and fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp, stirring regularly. Decant into a small bowl., Make the Royal pasta dough. Once it’s relaxed for 30 minutes, roll out on a clean flour-dusted surface into a rectangle roughly ½cm thick., Using a sharp knife, cut it into long ½cm strips, then with lightly oiled fingers gently roll each strip into a long thin sausage shape, starting at the middle and carefully rolling outwards, placing them on a semolina-dusted tray as you go., When the ragù has around 10 minutes to go, cook the pici in a large pan of boiling salted water for 6 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain, reserving a cupful of cooking water., Toss the pici with the ragù, adding a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a little reserved cooking water to loosen, if needed. Divide between bowls, then grate over some Parmesan, sprinkle over the pangrattato, and serve."

(You can make of that what you will!). I was really surprised to find out that Nonno lives by himself, and I was very impressed to hear that he still cooks for himself every day; although there are always friends and family nearby to help him if he needs it. His favourite thing to cook for himself is mussels with pasta, so I’m going to talk you through the recipe as he explained it to me., Get a pan of salted water on to boil. Pour a few drizzles of extra virgin olive oil into a separate little pan and put it on a medium heat. Add the garlic, dried chilli and anchovy, then squeeze in and add the cherry tomatoes as the garlic begins to fry – at no point should the garlic take on any colour, but you need the heat to be hot enough to melt the anchovies. The juice from the tomatoes and oil will make a light, very delicate and simple sauce., Add the linguine to the pan of boiling water and cook according to packet instructions. Meanwhile, add a good handful of washed and debearded mussels to the tomato sauce. Give the pan a little toss, then place a lid on top and cook until all the mussels are open. As usual with mussels, if any remain closed after cooking, throw them away. Add a handful of chopped parsley to the pan., The pasta will now be a little under al dente and only a minute away from being ready. Nonno likes to drain his pasta, saving a little of the cooking water, then he puts the pasta back into the big pot and pours the mussel sauce over the top, mixing everything together well. Put the pot back on a low heat for an extra minute or two to cook the pasta perfectly – it will suck up all the lovely mussel juice. To finish, drizzle over a good bit of olive oil, season to taste and serve immediately."

Cut a slit into each sausage and squeeze the meat out into a large ovenproof pan with a little olive oil. Cook on a medium heat for around 10 minutes, or until golden and crispy, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon as you go. Add the chopped fennel, and fennel seeds, then crumble in the dried chilli. Finely chop and add the rosemary leaves, then cook for a further 10 minutes, or until the fennel has softened. Pour in the wine and passata and top up with 400ml water, give it a stir, then pop the lid on. Transfer to the oven and leave to blip away for 2 hours – check on it every 40 minutes, stirring and adding a splash of water if it starts to dry out., Meanwhile, if you’re making fresh pasta, get on with making your dough. Add the eggs and flour to a food processor with a pinch of salt and whiz until combined. Roll the dough through a pasta machine, starting on the widest setting and working your way down to the second to last. If you don’t have a pasta machine simply divide the pasta into 6 pieces and roll each piece into nice thin sheets using a rolling pin. Once at the right thickness (you’re aiming for slightly thicker than a playing card) roll through the pappardelle cutter or lightly roll in half and over once more, then slice into 2.5cm pieces and toss to separate, dusting with flour to stop it from sticking.

Cook the pasta for 2 to 3 minutes in boiling salted water (or if you’re using dried pasta, cook according to packet instructions), then drain, reserving a cupful of the cooking water. Taste and check the ragu seasoning, then mix through the pasta, loosening with a splash of cooking water if needed. Divide between your plates or bowls, and finish with a grating of Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

Gennaro has even stumbled across some at a local park in the middle of London, so keep your eyes open., You should be able to get hold of it at good green grocers or your local farmer’s market, but, if not, you can sort of mimic the flavours by blitzing some fresh spinach and a couple of cloves of regular garlic together, so you get a wonderful green garlicky sauce., Bash up the fennel seeds and chillies in a pestle and mortar, then put to one side. Heat a splash of olive oil in a pan on a medium heat. Cut open the sausage skins and squeeze the meat into the pan. Stir it around with a wooden spoon, breaking it up into small pieces so it resembles coarse mince. Fry for a few minutes until the meat starts to colour and the fat has started to render out., Add the bashed up fennel seeds and chillies to the meat, and cook on a medium heat for around 10 minutes until the meat is crisp, dark golden brown and caramelised. Turn the heat down to low., Put a large saucepan of salted water on to boil. If you managed to get hold of wild garlic leaves, simply blanch them in the boiling water for 3 minutes, then scoop out and put in a food processor. If you aren’t using wild garlic, add the garlic cloves to the water and cook for 3 to 4 minutes before adding the spinach. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, until the spinach has wilted, then fish out all the spinach and the garlic cloves with a slotted spoon, and put it all into a food processor. Add the fusilli to the water, bring it back to the boil and cook according to the packet instructions., Blitz the wild garlic leaves or the cooked garlic and spinach in the food processor, until you have a deep green sauce, then add a lug of olive oil, a grating of lemon zest and a pinch of salt and pepper., When the pasta is al dente, drain it in a colander, reserving some of the cooking water. Put the pasta back in the saucepan and add a splash of the cooking water and a squeeze of lemon juice. Gently stir the lovely green sauce into the pasta to coat it then immediately divide the pasta between your bowls. Top with the delicious crisp sausage meat and a nice grating of Parmesan cheese, and serve."

Like the ‘full of veg’ tomato sauce you can always whiz the asparagus in a blender if you think they’ll be suspicious of the green bits., The tomato does a good job of mellowing the flavour of the asparagus and once they’re used to eating it there are loads of wonderful dishes you can introduce them to., Heat a saucepan over a medium heat and add a nice lug of olive oil. Add the garlic and fry until it turns a light golden brown. Add the chopped basil stalks and tinned tomatoes, and bring to the boil. Season with pepper and a tiny pinch of salt, then simmer for 5 minutes., Snap the woody ends off the asparagus stalks and throw them away. You can either chop the asparagus finely with a knife or use a food processor. Add it to the tomato sauce, let it simmer for 1 minute or so, then take it off the heat. Taste, and add a little salt and pepper if needed. Finish off the sauce by stirring in the basil leaves., Cook the tagliatelle according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving some of the pasta water. Toss in the pasta sauce with a little of the water to loosen. Serve with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and plenty of Parmesan cheese."

Meanwhile, crush the pine nuts in a pestle and mortar with the garlic. Scoop out, put to one side, then put the basil in the mortar with a pinch of sea salt and bash until it turns into a green paste. Return the bashed nuts and garlic to the mortar with the lemon juice, a few tablespoons of oil and half the pecorino. Stir together and season well with salt and a little pepper., Peel the potatoes, discarding the peel, then continue stripping the potato with the peeler until you have a pile of thin potato strips., Add some salt to the boiling water and add the tagliatelle, the trimmed beans and the potato strips. Cook for 2–3 minutes until the beans are cooked but still have a slight bite, the pasta is al dente and the potatoes are cooked through. Drain in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water., Toss the cooked pasta and vegetables in a bowl with the pesto. Taste and season again, if necessary. Add a little of the reserved pasta cooking water to moisten the sauce if it’s a little thick and claggy. Serve sprinkled with the remaining pecorino and extra basil."

Add a few lugs of the best olive oil you can find, season to taste and gently stir together., Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water until tender, then drain and add to the mixing bowl. Stir it all together and let it sit for a minute or two, so the pasta starts to suck up all the lovely flavoured juices in the bowl. Stir again, check the seasoning and serve sprinkled with the marjoram, oregano or thyme leaves."

Feel free to use tagliatelle as well., Blanch and skin the tomatoes, then halve them and chop into small pieces., Put a pan of salted water on to heat for the pasta. Put a couple of lugs of olive oil in a second pan, and fry the prawns, garlic, lemon zest and tomatoes for a couple of minutes. Add the booze and allow to flame if you like. (The flame should go out after about 30 seconds, so don’t worry!) Add the cream, allow to simmer gently for a couple more minutes and then remove the pan from the heat. Season the sauce carefully with salt, pepper and the lemon juice., Put the pasta into the boiling water — fresh will need only 3 minutes and dried will need to be cooked according to the packet instructions. If your sauce has cooled down then reheat it now. When the pasta is cooked, drain it in a colander and then toss with the parsley in the pan in which it was cooked. Check the seasoning, then divide on to your serving plates with the sauce on top. Serve straight away, telling your guests to stir the pasta up in their bowls every so often to keep the pasta moist., Try this: Crumble over a little ricotta or feta cheese – just a little bit – both of these cheeses have a nice texture, go really well with prawns and make it look great., And this: A handful of spinach added at the end gives a nice vibe — the heat will wilt it into the sauce., Or this: You can use tinned tomatoes for this dish but you won’t get the freshness or lightness that you get from fresh tomatoes."

Heat a wide frying pan and gently fry the chopped asparagus stalks in a little olive oil with the pancetta. When the asparagus softens slightly turn the heat off and mash them roughly with the back of a fork., Cook the tagliatelle in plenty of boiling salted water, according to pack instructions. Add the asparagus tips for the last 2 minutes of cooking time., Drain the pasta, reserving a cup of the cooking water, and toss with the mashed asparagus and pancetta., Stir in most of the Parmesan cheese and season with salt and pepper. If needed loosen the pasta with a little of the cooking water. Serve with the last of the Parmesan sprinkled on top., Tip: Cooking your asparagus with the pasta is a clever way to save on time and washing up."

Stir and add the Parmesan and pecorino., What you should have now is a reasonably thick sauce, which you should think of more as a dressing, so taste it and think about how the different flavours are coming through. I want you to balance the flavours so you end up with something quite zingy because, as the sauce heats up and the cheese melts, the flavour of the lemon will calm down a lot. Season with some freshly ground black pepper. Taste it and if you think you haven’t got the balance right, simply add a little more oil and Parmesan., Put a large pot of salted water on to boil for your pasta. Sit the sauce bowl on top of the pan while the water’s heating up – this will take the chill out of the sauce and warm it through slightly., When the water starts to boil, remove the bowl and add your pasta to the water. Cook it according to the packet instructions then drain in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water., Toss the pasta with the sauce and a little of the reserved cooking water to help loosen it up a bit. The heat from the pasta will melt the cheese, allowing all the lovely sauce to coat it. If you find the sauce is too thick then add a little more water. It’s not supposed to be claggy, thick and miserable, but incredibly silky, fresh and fragrant., Have one last taste to balance the flavours, and serve with a little extra Parmesan shaved over the top and a sprinkle of parsley leaves. Eat immediately."

Add your tomatoes to the pan, breaking them up with a wooden spoon and bring to the boil. Drop in the roasted squash, bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 minutes., Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, add the penne and cook for a couple of minutes less than it says on the packet. Drain, then toss with the sauce., Tear up the basil leaves and sprinkle into the pan with some salt and pepper. Stir in the ricotta and the stock, then bring back to the boil., Rub a large baking tray, ovenproof pan or earthenware dish with olive oil and spoon in all the pasta and sauce. Tear over the ball of mozzarella and top with the Parmesan. Rub the sage leaves with a little olive oil and put on top., Pop it into the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes or until golden and bubbling. Serve with a crisp green salad., Tip: If you're a chilli freak like me, try adding a chopped fresh chilli to your tomato sauce."

I thought the combination of flavours was great, and very accessible to us back home in Britain. You can buy very high-quality frozen prawns in supermarkets these days (thaw before using), so it’s a win-win situation, but if you can get hold of some super-fresh ones and peel them yourself this can all of a sudden become very luxurious in flavour. A real crowd-pleaser. Finish off with good-quality olive oil and wild rocket full of flavour and you’ll be laughing. ”",699,24.3g,3.3g,5.5g,2.1g,33.5g,86.9g,4.2g,"455                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried spaghetti, 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves                                                                                                                                                                garlic, extra virgin olive oil, 1-2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    dried red chillies, 400                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                peeled raw prawns                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources, ask your fishmonger, 1                                                                                                                                                                small wineglass                                                                                                                                                                white wine, 2                                                                                                                                                                heaped tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                sun-dried tomato purée                                                                                                                                                                , or 6 sun-dried tomatoes blitzed in a blender, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 2                                                                                                                                                                handfuls of                                                                                                                                                                rocket","Cook your spaghetti in a large pan of salted boiling water according to the packet instructions., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the garlic. Heat 3 good lugs of extra virgin olive oil in a large frying pan, then toss in the garlic and crumble in the chilli. As the garlic begins to colour, add the prawns and sauté them for a minute. Add the white wine and tomato purée, and simmer for a couple of minutes., Grate the zest of the lemon and roughly chop the rocket. When the pasta is ready, drain it in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water., Toss the spaghetti with the sauce, squeeze in the lemon juice, add half the chopped rocket, adding a little of the reserved cooking water if you want to loosen the sauce a bit, and correct the seasoning with sea salt and black pepper., Divide between 4 plates and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest and the rest of the rocket leaves."

While that’s happening, sort through your cleaned clams and if there are any that aren’t tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they don’t close, throw them away. Put a large pan with a lid on a high heat and let it heat up. Finely slice the parsley stalks, then put them to one side and roughly chop the leaves. Peel and chop the garlic, quarter the tomatoes and get your wine ready., Add the pasta to the boiling water with a good pinch of salt and cook according to packet instructions until al dente. About 5 minutes before your pasta is ready, get ready to start cooking – you'll have to be quick about this, so no mucking about! Put 4 generous lugs of extra virgin olive oil into the hot pan and add the garlic, parsley stalks and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Crumble in the dried chilli and add the chopped tomatoes. Stir everything around constantly and just as the garlic starts to colour, tip in the clams and pour in the wine. It will splutter and steam, so give everything a good shake and put the lid on the pan. After about 3 or 4 minutes the clams will start to open, so keep shuffling the pan around until all of them have opened. Take the pan off the heat. Get rid of any clams that haven't opened., By now your pasta should be just about perfect. Drain and add to the pan of clams along with the parsley leaves and an extra drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Stir or toss for a further minute or two to let the beautiful seashore juices from the clams be absorbed into the pasta. Serve right away. No sane Italian would eat this dish without some fresh hunks of bread to mop up the juices. Beautiful!, PS The first time you make this it will be good, but you might find things don't come together exactly at the right time. But don't worry, this dish is all about confidence and the more you make this, the more you'll find the pasta and clams are ready and perfect at the same time. And then it will be great!"

If you are a fan of sausages and eggs you’ll love this combination. Not only does it look impressive but it’s so quick to make. There’s a subtle line between having a smooth, silky egg sauce and scrambled eggs – both will taste delicious but smooth and silky is far more desirable., With a sharp knife, slit the sausage skins lengthways and pop all the meat out. Using wet hands, roll little balls of sausagemeat about the size of large marbles and place them to one side., Heat a large frying pan and add a good splash of olive oil. Gently fry the sausage meatballs until golden brown all over, then add the pancetta and continue cooking for a couple of minutes, until it’s golden. While this is cooking, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the linguine, and cook according to the packet instructions., In a large bowl, whip up the egg yolks, cream, half the Parmesan, the lemon zest and parsley. When the pasta is cooked, drain it in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water, and immediately toss it quickly with the egg mixture back in the pasta pan. Add the hot sausage meatballs and toss everything together. The egg will cook delicately from the heat of the linguine, just enough for it to thicken and not scramble. The sauce should be smooth and silky. If the pasta becomes a little claggy, add a few spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water to loosen it slightly. Sprinkle over the rest of the Parmesan, season if necessary, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve. Eat immediately!"

cheese recipe ever (even though it's a bit naughty)!  I've used sweet tomatoes in my recipe as they really complement the cheese, and instead of béchamel sauce I've used single cream as it's a lot lighter. I've also topped the dish off with cheesy breadcrumbs, which give it a wonderful crunch. I think you'll laugh when you see how easy it is to make. I put it together extremely quickly by using my Magimix food processor. Don't worry if you haven't got one – you can chop it all up by hand instead and then mix it in a bowl., Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Get a pan of salted boiling water going and cook your macaroni according to the packet instructions. Meanwhile, break your bread up, place it in the food processor and whiz it up to form breadcrumbs. Set aside. Wash your tomatoes and place them in the food processor with the garlic, basil, sun-dried tomatoes, anchovies and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Whiz up for 30 seconds. Then add 2 handfuls of the Parmesan, the cream, vinegar and grated nutmeg. Whiz until smooth and season carefully to taste so it's really yummy!, By this time your macaroni will probably be cooked, so drain it in a colander, saving some of the cooking water. Place the pasta back into the pan and pour over every last bit of the cheesy sauce. You want it to be quite loose because you'll be surprised how quickly the sauce will disappear inside the macaroni and will look dry. So add a few spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water. Now you need to get yourself a baking dish about 8–10cm deep – this could be an earthenware dish or even a shallow ovenproof pan. Pour the pasta straight into your baking dish and break the mozzarella into little pieces over the top. Mix the last handful of Parmesan with the thyme leaves and breadcrumbs and sprinkle evenly over the top of the dish. Drizzle generously with good extra virgin olive oil – this will give you a lovely crunch topping., Place in the preheated oven for 20–25 minutes or until piping hot and golden on top. Serve straight away, sprinkled with a little extra Parmesan. Best eaten with a nice salad – and you'll love it."

Snip the sausages apart, then squeeze and pinch the meat out of the skins so that you get little meatball shapes – don’t make them too big or they will take too long to cook., Try to get at least three balls out of each sausage. Don’t worry about rolling them into perfect balls and making them look all fancy – rough and rustic is good! Put them into your pan. Keep frying and turning the meatballs until they’re golden brown and cooked through., Meanwhile, put the spaghetti into a large pan of salted boiling water and cook according to the packet instructions until al dente., To make your tomato sauce, heat a separate pan and pour in some olive oil. Add the garlic and the chopped basil stalks and move them around the pan for a couple of minutes. Put some small basil leaves to one side for later, and sprinkle the rest into the pan. Add the tomatoes and season carefully to taste., Bring to a simmer, break up your tomatoes a bit more with a spoon and add a swig of balsamic vinegar – it’s lovely for adding sweetness to the sauce., Add the herbs to the pan of sausage meatballs, tossing everything in all the lovely flavours. Cook for around 30 seconds. When your spaghetti is cooked, drain it and divide the pasta and meatballs between four bowls., Spoon over the tomato sauce. Sprinkle over the reserved basil leaves and serve with a handful of fresh peas per person in the middle of the table, so that everyone can have a go at podding their own, and a little Parmesan for grating and shaving over the top."

Put to one side., Heat a lug of olive oil in a heavy-bottomed frying pan over a high heat. Squeeze the meat out of the sausage skins or add the pork mince to the pan, really breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon. Fry for a few minutes, or until the meat starts to colour and the fat has rendered slightly, then push it down once more so it resembles coarse mince., Add the bashed-up fennel seeds and chillies and cook over a medium heat for around 10 minutes, or until the meat becomes crisp, golden brown and slightly caramelised., Stir in the oregano, then pour in the white wine and allow it to reduce by half. Finely grate over the zest of 1 lemon, then squeeze over the  juice and turn the heat down to low., Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pan of salted boiling water according to the packet instructions., When the pasta has cooked but still has a bit of bite, drain it in a colander, reserving a mugful of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the meat pan, then toss to coat in all those lovely flavours, loosening with a good splash of the reserved cooking water, if needed., Grate in the Parmesan, then pick, roughly chop and add the parsley leaves. Taste and check the seasoning, then serve immediately with a little extra grated Parmesan sprinkled over the top., Jamie’s top tip Remember to buy the best sausages you can afford – if you get cheap, dodgy sausages it just won’t work."

Place a lid on, and cook slowly for 15 minutes until softened. Don't rush this too much, as cooking the peppers slowly like this really helps to bring out the flavour., While the peppers are cooking, peel and finely slice the onion, and peel and grate the garlic. Finely chop the parsley leaves and reserve the stalks., Add the onion to the pan and cook for a further 20 minutes. Then add the garlic and parsley stalks and toss around, keeping everything moving in the pan. Cook for about 3 minutes most. Have a little taste, and season with a bit more salt and pepper. Add the vinegar – it will sizzle away, so give everything a good toss., Grate the Parmesan and add one handful of the Parmesan and the mascarpone or crème fraîche, if using, and turn the heat down to minimum while you cook the pasta., Meanwhile, put a large pot of salted water on to boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the packet instructions. When cooked, drain in a colander, reserving some of the cooking water., Put the peppers, pasta and parsley leaves into a large warmed bowl. Give them a good toss together, then add a little of the pasta cooking water and a few good lugs of extra virgin olive oil to coat the pasta nicely. Serve straight away sprinkled with the rest of the Parmesan."

Since discovering how well they work I've been using them in soups, risottos, roasts and casseroles., In a large, non-stick frying pan, fry your pancetta and herbs in the olive oil for 2 minutes, then add the garlic and parsnips. Cook for a further 3 minutes on a medium heat, until the pancetta is slightly golden and the parsnips have softened nicely. Cook your tagliatelle in salted boiling water according to packet instructions, then drain, reserving a little of the cooking water. Mix the pasta with the parsnips and pancetta and stir in the butter and the Parmesan, adding a little of the cooking water to loosen the mixture and make it creamy and shiny. Season to taste."

Pick the mint leaves and discard the stalks. Finely grate the Parmesan. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and drop in the stock cube (if using). Stir until it’s dissolved, then add the mini shells and cook according to the packet instructions. Get a large frying pan over a medium heat and add a good lug of olive oil. Add the bacon to the pan, sprinkle a little pepper over and fry until golden and crisp., Meanwhile, finely chop your mint leaves. As soon as the bacon is golden, add your frozen peas and give the pan a good shake. After a minute or so, add the crème fraîche and chopped mint to the bacon and peas. Drain the pasta in a colander over a large bowl, reserving some of the cooking water., Add the pasta to the frying pan. Halve your lemon and squeeze the juice over the pasta. When it’s all bubbling away nicely, remove from the heat. The sauce should be creamy and delicious but if it’s too thick for you, add a splash of the reserved cooking water to thin it out a bit.

Pick and finely chop the parsley leaves, then finely slice the stalks., Put a large frying pan on a high heat and add a few good lugs of olive oil. Once hot, add the garlic, chilli, capers and parsley stalks. Cook for a couple of minutes, or until just starting to colour., Cut the herring into 2cm strips, then add to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. They will start to break up but don’t worry. Quarter and add the tomatoes and squeeze in the lemon juice., Use tongs to transfer the cooked linguine straight into the frying pan, bringing a little of the cooking water with it. Add the butter (if using), and toss everything together in the pan., Have a taste, season with sea salt and black pepper, add most of the parsley leaves and a lug of extra virgin olive oil. Mix again – use tongs if you need to – then transfer to a large platter., Scatter over the remaining parsley leaves and whack it in the centre of the table so everyone can tuck straight in."

Grate over a quarter of the nutmeg, tear over the mozzarella and sprinkle over the extra Parmesan., Bake the macaroni cheese in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, finishing up with a quick whack under the grill, until golden brown and crispy on top."

This way they will burst in your mouth and be lovely and sweet. When cooked, drain in a colander, saving a little of the cooking water., Add the pasta to the pancetta. Pick and finely slice the mint leaves and stir in most of them. If the pan isn't big enough, mix it all together in a large warmed bowl., Now you need to add the egg and cream mix to the pasta. What's important here is that you add it while the pasta is still hot. This way, the residual heat of the pasta will cook the eggs, but not so that they resemble scrambled eggs, as I've seen in some dodgy old restaurants on the motorway! The pasta will actually cook the egg enough to give you a silky smooth sauce. Toss together and loosen with a little of the reserved cooking water if necessary., Season with salt and pepper, grate over the Parmesan and sprinkle over the rest of the mint leaves, and serve as soon as possible."

Here’s my version..., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Put your porcini mushrooms in a bowl and pour over just enough boiling water to cover them (approx. 150ml/5½fl oz). Put to one side to soak for a few minutes. Heat a saucepan big enough to hold all the ingredients, and pour in a splash of olive oil. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and brown them gently in the oil. Strain the porcini, reserving the soaking water, and add them to the pan with the garlic and fresh mushrooms. Add the wine, with the strained porcini soaking water, and turn the heat down. Simmer gently until the chicken pieces are cooked through and the wine has reduced a little., Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions and drain well. Add the cream to the pan of chicken, then bring to the boil and turn the heat off. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the drained spaghetti to the creamy chicken sauce and toss well. Add three-quarters of the Parmesan and all of the basil and stir well. Transfer to an ovenproof baking dish or non-stick pan, sprinkle with half the remaining cheese and bake in the oven until golden brown, bubbling and crisp. Divide between your plates, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with the rest of the cheese before serving."

When the oil’s hot, add the garlic and chilli and fry until lightly coloured., Drop in most of the basil – stand back as it will crackle and spit in the oil – and then, after a few seconds, add the tomatoes. Bring to the boil and simmer for about 5 minutes. You’ll end up with a chunky sauce – if you like it smoother, pass the sauce through a coarse sieve. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. On a lightly floured work surface, cut the lasagne sheets into strips with a knife or a pastry wheel. When the water is at a rolling boil, add the pasta and cook for a few minutes until just al dente., Drain the pasta strips in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water., Stir the pasta into the warm sauce. If it’s a bit thick, add a few spoonfuls of the cooking water to loosen it up. Sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and the reserved basil leaves and serve immediately."

It is eaten by families at gatherings or celebrations and is also something the monks I visited at the Abbazia di Farfa, just outside Rome, have every Sunday as a special lunch. I’m pleased to say my faith in this dish has been restored, as I did fall out of love with it (as a result of trying to cook it in schools on a tight budget, using the cheapest pasta in the world). When I was in Altamura, in Puglia, I visited a school where they were eating baked pasta for their school lunch, bizarrely enough! However, Italian government laws state that the schools must use organic pasta and extra virgin olive oil, and they also had freshly made mozzarella! When made properly like this, it’s absolutely delicious.

grated","Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Then find a metal baking tray or ovenproof dish that will fit the cannelloni in one layer so it's nice and snug. This way you'll get the right cover of sauce and the right amount of crispiness on top. When I cook this at home I just use one pan to cut down on lots of washing up!, Take your metal tray or a saucepan, put it on a high heat and add your butter, a drizzle of olive oil, one of the sliced garlic cloves, a handful of marjoram or oregano and the grated nutmeg. By the time the pan is hot the garlic should be soft., Put as much spinach as will fit into the pan. Keep turning it over; it will wilt quickly so you will be able to keep adding more spinach until it's all in. Moisture will cook out of the spinach, which is fine. By cooking it this way you don't lose any of the nutrients that you would if boiling it in water., After 5 minutes, put the spinach into a large bowl and leave to cool. Place the pan back on the heat, add a little olive oil, the other clove of sliced garlic, your basil stalks and the tomatoes, then fill one of the empty tomato tins with cold water and add this too., Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down, add a pinch of salt and pepper and the sugar, and simmer for about 10 minutes, until you get a loose tomato sauce consistency. Then take the pan off the heat and add the basil leaves., By now the spinach will have cooled down, so squeeze any excess liquid out of it and pour this back into the bowl. Finely chop the spinach and put it back into the bowl. Mix it with the liquid, add the ricotta and a handful of the Parmesan, and then use a piping bag to squeeze the mixture into the cannelloni. You can make your own piping bag by getting a sandwich bag and putting the spinach mix into the corner of it. Then twist the bag up and cut the corner off. Carefully squeeze the filling into the cannelloni tubes so each one is filled right up – really easy., Lay the cannelloni over the tomato sauce in the pan. Or you can pour the tomato sauce into your ovenproof dish and lay the cannelloni on top., To make the white sauce, mix together the crème fraîche, anchovies and the 2 handfuls of Parmesan with a little salt and pepper, then loosen with a little water until you can spoon it over the cannelloni., Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan and the mozzarella pieces, and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes until golden and bubbling."

Feel free to use any tubular pasta you want. I’ve made this dish my own by lightening it with sweet tomatoes and giving it some crunch with delicious breadcrumbs. Just you wait till you try it! This dish isn’t going to win any prizes in the nutrition department, but you can, and should, balance it with a nice salad.

Melt the butter in a large ovenproof saucepan over a low heat, then add the flour and turn the heat up to medium, stirring all the time, until you get a paste – this is your roux., Add all the sliced garlic – don’t worry about the amount because each slice will caramelise like toffee in the roux. Keep cooking and stirring until golden and the garlic is nice and sticky., Add the bay leaves and slowly whisk in the milk a little at a time to ensure you get a nice smooth sauce. Bring the mixture to the boil, then leave it on a low heat to simmer and tick away, stirring occasionally., Preheat your oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7., Add the pasta to the pan of boiling salted water and cook according to the packet instructions. Meanwhile, roughly chop the tomatoes on a board and season them well with sea salt and black pepper. Grate the Cheddar and Parmesan., Drain the pasta and add it immediately to the sauce. Give it a good stir and take the pan off the heat. Stir in your grated cheeses, chopped tomatoes and pick in half of the thyme leaves. A little Worcestershire sauce added now is nice, and so is a little grating or two of nutmeg. Now work on the flavour – taste it and season it until it’s hitting the right spot. You want it to be slightly too wet because it will thicken up again in the oven, so add a splash of water if needed., If you’ve made your sauce in an ovenproof casserole-type pan, leave everything in there; if not, transfer it to a deep earthenware dish. Bake it for 30 minutes in the oven, until golden, bubbling, crispy and delicious., While it’s cooking, put your breadcrumbs and the rest of the the thyme leaves into a pan with a few drizzles of olive oil over a medium heat. Stir and toss the crumbs around until crunchy and golden all over. Remove from the heat and tip into a nice bowl., Serve your macaroni cheese in the centre of the table, with your bowl of crispy breadcrumbs for sprinkling over, and a lovely green salad."

Make a well in the centre and crack the eggs into it. Beat the eggs with a fork until smooth., Using the tips of your fingers, mix the eggs with the flour, incorporating a little at a time, until everything is combined., Knead the pieces of dough together – with a bit of work and some love and attention they’ll all bind together to give you one big, smooth lump of dough!, Once you’ve made your dough you need to knead and work it with your hands to develop the gluten in the flour, otherwise your pasta will be flabby and soft when you cook it, instead of springy and al dente. There’s no secret to kneading. You just have to bash the dough about a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, pulling it, stretching it, squashing it again. It’s quite hard work, and after a few minutes it’s easy to see why the average Italian grandmother has arms like Frank Bruno! You’ll know when to stop – it’s when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky instead of rough and floury., Wrap the dough in clingfilm and put it in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes – make sure the clingfilm covers it well or it will dry out and go crusty round the edges (this will give you crusty lumps through your pasta when you roll it out, and nobody likes crusty lumps!)., How to roll your pasta: first of all, if you haven't got a pasta machine it's not the end of the world! All the mammas I met while travelling round Italy rolled pasta with their trusty rolling pins and they wouldn't even consider having a pasta machine in the house! When it comes to rolling, the main problem you'll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. It's quite difficult to get a big lump of dough rolled out in one piece, and you need a very long rolling pin to do the job properly. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces of pasta rather than a few big ones. You'll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than the long rectangular shapes you'll get from a machine, but use your head and you'll be all right!, If using a machine to roll your pasta, make sure it's clamped firmly to a clean work surface before you start (use the longest available work surface you have). If your surface is cluttered with bits of paper, the kettle, the bread bin, the kids' homework and stuff like that, shift all this out of the way for the time being. It won't take a minute, and starting with a clear space to work in will make things much easier, I promise., Dust your work surface with some Tipo 00 flour, take a lump of pasta dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips. Set the pasta machine at its widest setting - and roll the lump of pasta dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks at all., Click the machine down a setting and roll the pasta dough through again. Fold the pasta in half, click the pasta machine back up to the widest setting and roll the dough through again. Repeat this process five or six times. It might seem like you're getting nowhere, but in fact you're working the dough, and once you've folded it and fed it through the rollers a few times, you'll feel the difference. It'll be smooth as silk and this means you're making wicked pasta!, Now it's time to roll the dough out properly, working it through all the settings on the machine, from the widest down to around the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the pasta with a little flour every time you run it through., When you've got down to the narrowest setting, to give yourself a tidy sheet of pasta, fold the pasta in half lengthways, then in half again, then in half again once more until you've got a square-ish piece of dough. Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll it down through the settings for the last time, you should end up with a lovely rectangular silky sheet of dough with straight sides - just like a real pro! If your dough is a little cracked at the edges, fold it in half just once, click the machine back two settings and feed it through again. That should sort things out., Whether you're rolling by hand or by machine you'll need to know when to stop. If you're making pasta like tagliatelle, lasagne or stracchi you'll need to roll the pasta down to between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card; if you're making a stuffed pasta like ravioli or tortellini, you'll need to roll it down slightly thinner or to the point where you can clearly see your hand or lines of newsprint through it., Once you've rolled your pasta the way you want it, you need to shape or cut it straight away. Pasta dries much quicker than you think, so whatever recipe you're doing, don't leave it more than a minute or two before cutting or shaping it. You can lay over a damp clean tea towel which will stop it from drying."
