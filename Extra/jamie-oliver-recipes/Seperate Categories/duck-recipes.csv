"Duck, pea and cabbage hash | Jamie Oliver recipes",,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/139634013.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '6']",,"“Pairing duck with peas is a great tradition. There is even a play called Duck with Peas, and a copy of the script published with beautiful engravings by Thomas Crawshall. But blessed is the kitchen that has leftover duck to make this venerable hash, the supreme leftovers dish. Quantities are really at the cook’s discretion. Any shortfall in meat can be made up with eggs, bacon or vegetables, in this instance peas, perhaps adding a few pea shoots to the mix. A great pan of hash taken to the table generally elicits a happy hum. This can be used for leftover roast meats in general. Trenchermen might need 2 eggs each. ”",,,,,,,,,"3                                                                                                                                                                soup spoons                                                                                                                                                                olive oil, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onions                                                                                                                                                                , peeled and chopped small, 6                                                                                                                                                                rashers of                                                                                                                                                                streaky smoked bacon, cut into small strips, 250                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                cooked peeled potato                                                                                                                                                                , chopped into thirds, 200-300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                cooked duck                                                                                                                                                                , coarsely chopped, a small                                                                                                                                                                Savoy cabbage                                                                                                                                                                , chopped and cooked until tender, 200                                                                                                                                                                g (approximately)                                                                                                                                                                cooked peas, 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                    organic eggs, 2                                                                                                                                                                soup spoons                                                                                                                                                                chopped parsley",

Roughly chop one onion and the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves in a bowl of iced water), bash the whole garlic cloves (skin and all), and quarter the tomatoes and orange, then add everything to the tray, squeezing in the orange juice as you go. Add the chipotle paste and give everything a good stir, making sure the duck is nicely coated. Roast for 1½ to 2 hours, or until the duck is cooked through, basting the duck in the lovely juices from time to time., Meanwhile, thinly slice the remaining onion, add to a bowl with the red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt, then scrunch everything together., Transfer the duck to a plate to cool slightly. Remove the garlic, orange and tomato skins from the sauce and discard, then mash everything together with a potato masher or wooden spoon. Place the tray on a low heat and reduce the sauce down a little until thickened. Shred the meat from the bones and stir through the sauce., Warm the tortillas in the cooling oven, then transfer to plates and top with a spoonful or two of the carnita mix, finished with a few picked coriander leaves and the quick-pickled onion."

(At this point you can carefully pour the duck fat from the tray into a clean jar and keep in the fridge for roasting potatoes.), Place the tray on a medium-high heat, then add 300ml of water and a splash of red wine vinegar. Bring to a simmer, scraping all the lovely sticky bits from the bottom of the pan, and stir through 1 tablespoon of hoisin sauce. Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then use tongs to transfer them to the tray and mix well, so they soak up all the lovely juices., Once the duck is cool enough to handle, shred it from the bone and separate the skin. Add the skin to a dry frying pan on a medium-high heat and fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until crisp, then set aside. Pop the pan back on the heat and add the shredded duck meat for 2 minutes, then add the remaining hoisin sauce.

Transfer the duck to a medium roasting tray and roast for around 1 hour 20 minutes., Meanwhile, halve the bulb of garlic across the middle, then peel and roughly slice the carrots and onions., When the time is up, remove the roasting tray from the oven. Carefully lift up the duck and scatter the veg into the tray to make a trivet. Sit the duck on top of the veg, then return the tray to the oven for a further 40 minutes, or until the duck is beautifully crisp and the meat falls easily away from the bone., Once cooked to perfections, remove the duck to a plate to rest while you get on with the gravy., Add the flour to the vegetables, then mash everything together with a potato masher, scraping up all the sticky goodness from the bottom., Place over a medium-high heat, pour in the Marsala and leave to bubble and cook away, stirring well., Add the stock, then bring to the boil and reduce to a simmer for around 15 minutes, or until thickened and reduced. Strain through a coarse sieve, skim away any fat from the surface, then season to taste., Shred or carve up the duck, then serve with the gravy on the side. Nice with duck fat roast potatoes, seasonal greens and cranberry sauce."

               free-range eggs","Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Place all the birds in a large roasting tray. Strip the thyme and half the rosemary leaves into a pestle and mortar, then bash up with the bay, juniper berries, a pinch of sea salt and ½ a tablespoon of black pepper., Muddle in 6 tablespoons of oil, then rub all over the birds. Roast for 1 hour., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion, carrots and celery. Wash, trim and finely slice the white part of the leeks (save the green for making stock or soup) and the bacon. Peel the potatoes and cut into 2cm chunks., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large pan on a medium heat, add the bacon to render out the fat, then strip in the remaining rosemary. Once golden, add the onion, carrots, celery and leeks, then cook for 45 minutes on a medium-low heat, or until softened, stirring occasionally and adding the potatoes halfway through., For the pastry, put the flour and a good pinch of salt into a bowl with the suet, cube and add the butter, then use your thumbs and forefingers to rub the fat into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs., Beat the eggs, then, reserving just enough to eggwash the pie, stir into the bowl with 180ml of ice-cold water. Use your hands to gently bring it together into a ball, but don’t overwork it. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes., When the time’s up, remove the birds from the oven. When cool enough to handle, pick all the meat, discarding the skin and bones. Sieve the tray juices into the stock., Reduce the oven temperature to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3., Stir the flour into the veg for 1 minute, then pour in the cider and cook for 10 minutes, or until slightly reduced., Shred the meat and stir into the veg pan, then add the stock. Season well, bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes, or until thickened., Carefully drain the liquid through a coarse sieve into a pan, skimming away any fat from the surface. Leave to cool., Grease the bottom of a pie dish (25cm x 30cm) with a little oil. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry on a clean flour-dusted surface to ½cm thick and use it to line the pie dish., Stir 300ml of the strained gravy through the meat and spoon into the dish. Eggwash the edges., Roll out the remaining pastry to ½cm thick and a little bigger than the pie dish, then carefully place on top of the pie, trimming off any overhang. Pinch the edges to seal and make two small incisions in the centre for the steam to escape. Use any spare pastry to decorate the pie, if you like., Eggwash the top, then bake at the bottom of the oven for 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden and the pie is piping hot., To serve, reheat the remaining gravy, skimming off any fat from the surface, and serve alongside the pie. Delicious with creamy mashed potato and seasonal mustardy dressed greens."

Preheat the oven to 180oC/350oF/gas 4., Peel the onion, cut into wedges and place in a roasting tray with the giblets and a splash of water., Rub the duck all over with 1 tablespoon of oil, 1 tablespoon of Chinese five-spice and a really good pinch of sea salt., Halve the clementine and place in the cavity, then sit the duck directly on the bars of the oven, with the tray of onions and giblets underneath to catch the tasty fat., Roast for 2 hours, or until the duck is crispy and cooked through, turning the onions occasionally to prevent them from catching., While the duck cooks, prep the garnishes. Trim and halve the spring onions and carrots, then finely slice lengthways, scratch a fork down the cucumber, and finely slice it with the chilli. Pick the herb leaves. Cut the lime into wedges., Remove the cooked duck to a platter, cover, and rest for 30 minutes. Pour all the fat from the tray into a jar, cool, and place in the fridge for tasty cooking another day., Now you’ve got a choice: you can make a dark hoisin utilizing the bonus flavour from the tray, or you can do it separately in a pan to achieve the vibrant colour you see in the picture – both ways are super-tasty, it’s purely personal preference., Using the tray, remove and discard the giblets, leaving the onions behind. Place over a medium heat on the hob, peel, roughly chop and add the garlic and ginger, add 1 teaspoon of five-spice, then stir in the cranberries, picking up all the sticky goodness from the base of the tray., Cook for 2 minutes, then add the soy, rice wine vinegar, honey, clementine juice and a splash of water. Simmer for 5 minutes, or until thick and glossy., Pour into a blender and blitz until smooth, then taste and season to perfection., If you’re doing it in a pan, just follow the instructions above, adding a splash of oil to the pan before the garlic, ginger and five-spice., In batches, warm the pancakes in a bamboo steamer over a pan of simmering water for just 1 to 2 minutes., Slice the duck meat, or get two forks and ravage it all off the bone. Serve everything in the middle of the table so everyone builds their own. The crispy duck skin will be an absolute treat dotted on top!"

Cover with clingfilm and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably longer., Remove the duck from the fridge and transfer the meat to a plate. Strain the onions through a sieve, saving both the marinating liquid and the onions in separate bowls, and set aside., Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the duck pieces and sauté for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer the duck to a clean plate and set aside., To the pan, add the marinated onions and cumin, then finely chop and add the coriander. Fry for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the onions are soft., Stir in the marinating liquid and bring it to the boil, then lower the heat, add the duck and cook for about 30 minutes, or until the meat is tender, turning halfway. Take off the heat., Peel, destone and roughly chop the avocado, finely chop the coriander leaves and chives, then combine in a bowl with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the lime juice. Season with a little sea salt to taste., When you’re ready to serve, take the duck pieces, warm or cold, and slice., Divide the onion mixture between 4 plates, top with a few slices of meat and a handful of the avocado salad. Deseed and finely chop the chilli, then scatter on top with a grating of lime zest, if you like."

oil","The day before you're ready to cook, pop all of the marinade ingredients into a dish, add the duck legs, turn them to coat, then cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge until needed., To cook the quinoa, place into a saucepan, cover with 450ml water, add a large pinch of sea salt and bring it to the boil., Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, until the quinoa has unfurled but still retains a bit of crunch., To make the plum sauce, set a griddle pan over a high heat. Halve, destone and pop the plums in a bowl and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the sugar over the cut sides., Griddle them for 2 minutes on each side, or until slightly charred and very soft., Return the plums to the bowl with the rest of the sugar and mash, then add the star anise and set aside (if your plums aren’t soft enough to mash, pop them in a pan over a low heat and simmer them with the star anise, a splash of water and a little extra sugar to taste, stirring until they collapse into a sauce). Set aside., To cook the duck, remove the legs from the marinade (reserve this) and pop them onto a griddle pan to cook very slowly over a medium-low heat for 40 minutes, until the meat is tender with a crisp skin, turning often and brushing with the reserved marinade., Drain the quinoa and set aside. Toast the nuts in a dry frying pan, then roughly crush. Pick and roughly chop the herb leaves. Slice the white and pale green parts of the spring onions, then shred the green part., Stir most of the crushed macadamias and herbs through the quinoa (reserving some to serve) with the white and pale green chopped spring onions and rice wine vinegar, as well as the honey, soy and oil., Serve the duck with the quinoa salad and fire-roasted plum sauce, with the shredded spring onion greens and reserved macadamias and herbs sprinkled on top. Finish with a few edible flowers, if you have them."

Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Rub the duck all over with olive oil, sea salt and black pepper. Put into a snug-fitting roasting tray and roast for 2 hours, or until golden and cooked through, then remove the duck to a board and set the tray aside for later., Peel the onions, garlic and celery, then finely chop and place in a large, wide pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, remove the duck skin and keep to one side (wear clean rubber gloves!), then shred the meat off the bones. Pour most of the Chianti into the pan and let it reduce for 10 to 15 minutes, then stir in the shredded duck meat., Stir the remaining splash of wine into the roasting tray and scrape all the lovely, crispy bits from the bottom, then pour into the pan. Scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands, then add 2 tins’ worth of water., Stir in the raisins, strip in the rosemary leaves and add the bay leaves, then simmer for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until thickened and reduced – if you’ve got any Parmesan rind, throw that in too for an added flavour dimension (just remember to take it out before serving!)., Meanwhile, peel the garlic and place in a food processor with the reserved duck skin. Tear in the bread, strip in the thyme leaves, then blitz until fine. Tip into a frying pan on a medium heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil and fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp, stirring regularly. Decant into a small bowl., Make the Royal pasta dough. Once it’s relaxed for 30 minutes, roll out on a clean flour-dusted surface into a rectangle roughly ½cm thick., Using a sharp knife, cut it into long ½cm strips, then with lightly oiled fingers gently roll each strip into a long thin sausage shape, starting at the middle and carefully rolling outwards, placing them on a semolina-dusted tray as you go., When the ragù has around 10 minutes to go, cook the pici in a large pan of boiling salted water for 6 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain, reserving a cupful of cooking water., Toss the pici with the ragù, adding a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a little reserved cooking water to loosen, if needed. Divide between bowls, then grate over some Parmesan, sprinkle over the pangrattato, and serve."

Transfer the duck to a medium roasting tray and roast for around 1 hour 20 minutes., Meanwhile, halve the bulb of garlic across the middle, then peel and roughly slice the carrots and onions., When the time is up, remove the roasting tray from the oven. Carefully lift up the duck and scatter the veg into the tray to make a trivet. Sit the duck on top of the veg, then return the tray to the oven for a further 40 minutes, or until the duck is beautifully crisp and the meat falls easily away from the bone., Once cooked to perfections, remove the duck to a plate to rest while you get on with the gravy., Add the flour to the vegetables, then mash everything together with a potato masher, scraping up all the sticky goodness from the bottom., Place over a medium-high heat, pour in the Marsala and leave to bubble and cook away, stirring well., Add the stock, then bring to the boil and reduce to a simmer for around 15 minutes, or until thickened and reduced. Strain through a coarse sieve, skim away any fat from the surface, then season to taste., Shred or carve up the duck, then serve with the gravy on the side. Nice with duck fat roast potatoes, seasonal greens and cranberry sauce."

    fresh coriander, leaves picked and stalks finely chopped","Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Wash the duck and pat it dry, inside and out, with kitchen paper, then rub it all over, inside as well, with sea salt and black pepper. Place it in a tray and roast in the preheated oven for around 2 hours, turning it every now and then. Halfway through, you’ll probably need to drain away a lot of the fat from the bird. Don't throw it away, though! Sieve it and keep the fat (but no meat juices) in a jar in the fridge for a couple of months and use it to roast potatoes., In a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker, bash up the dried chillies and coriander seeds and add the ground cinnamon and a good pinch of salt and pepper., Scoop the seeds out of your squash and put them to one side. Cut the squash into wedges, place them in a roasting tray, and drizzle over enough olive oil just to coat. Sprinkle over the ground spices and give the squash a good toss, spreading the pieces out in one layer., Once the duck has been in the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, add the tray of squash to the oven and roast for about 45 minutes., Meanwhile, rinse the squash seeds after removing any fibres. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Toast them in a dry frying pan until they’re golden and crisp, and put aside., To make the dressing, put the lime juice and zest into a bowl and add the same amount of extra virgin olive oil, plus the sesame oil and the soy sauce. Stir in the sugar, chilli, garlic, the green spring onion ends and coriander stalks. Taste and adjust the sweet-and-sourness and the seasoning. You want it to be a little limey, to contrast with the rich duck., After 2 hours, if the duck is nice and crispy, and the squash soft and sticky, take both trays out of the oven. If they need more time, leave them in until perfectly done. Using two forks, shred the duck meat off the bone and put into a large bowl., While the duck and squash are still warm, toss with the toasted seeds, half the coriander leaves, half the mint and half the white spring onion slices. Pour on the dressing and toss together. Serve sprinkled with the rest of the coriander, mint and white spring onion slices."

Grate half the nutmeg and zest both oranges. Cut the oranges in half and set aside for stuffing the duck., Put everything on a board with one tablespoon of sea salt and chop it all up. Rub the mixture all over the ducks, inside and out. Cover and leave in the fridge for a few hours or overnight to let the flavours penetrate., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 and arrange the shelves on the middle and bottom levels. Stuff the ducks with the remaining rosemary sprigs, garlic cloves and reserved orange halves., Peel and quarter the onions, then trim and roughly chop the celery and carrots. Peel and chop the ginger. Scatter the veg and ginger in the bottom of a large, deep-sided roasting tray with the cinnamon and bay leaves. Roughly chop the reserved duck neck and giblets and add to the mix., Place the ducks breast-side up, straight on to the bars of the middle shelf, then pop the veg-filled roasting tray on the bottom shelf beneath the ducks ready to catch all the lovely fat that drips out of them., Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into chunks. Pop them in a pan and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a simmer and parboil for 5 to 10 minutes, then tip into a colander and chuff them up a little., After the duck has roasted for an hour, take the bottom tray out of the oven, replacing it immediately with an empty tray. Spoon the fat from the veggie tray into a bowl. Put all the veg, duck bits and juices into a large saucepan, then add a little boiling water to the tray to get all the sticky brown bits off the bottom – this is what you’re going to make your gravy with. Tip the water and brown bits into the pan with the veg, top up with 1 litre of water or chicken stock and place on a medium heat, skimming off any of the fat that rises to the top., Put your parboiled potatoes into the empty tray in the oven. Add a few more tablespoons of duck fat from the bowl, season, and place back underneath the ducks to cook for an hour., Meanwhile, heat a saucepan and add 2 tablespoons of duck fat. When it’s hot and melted, add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon until you have a paste. Stir in the contents of the saucepan and the Port. Bring the gravy to the boil and simmer gently for half an hour, stirring occasionally. By now the ducks will have had 2 hours in the oven and will be done. Lift them on to a plate, cover loosely with tin foil and leave to rest for about 15 minutes., Pour the gravy through a sieve into a clean saucepan, pressing down on all the veg and other bits to extract as many flavours and juices as you can. Keep the gravy warm in the saucepan, again skimming off any fat on the surface., When you're ready to dish up – don’t carve the ducks! The best thing to do is to pull the meat away from the bones with a pair of tongs or with your fingers wearing clean kitchen gloves, then let everyone fight over the delicious skin. Serve with your potatoes and gravy."

Place it upside down on a roasting tray and roast for one hour. Then turn the duck the right side up, drain off any fat from the tray and roast for another hour., While you allow the duck to cool, make your remoulade. Put the crème fraîche, lemon juice and mustard into a bowl, season with salt and pepper and mix well. Add the celeriac, pears and most of the parsley, and carefully combine., Divide your remoulade between six small bowls and scatter with a little more chopped parsley. Shred the cooled duck with a couple of forks or your hands, and serve alongside the remoulade. Fantastic!"

Wash the duck, inside and out, and thoroughly pat dry with some kitchen paper. Place breast-side up in a roasting tray and stuff with the orange halves and the sprigs of rosemary and sage., Mix the Chinese five-spice with a good pinch of salt and pepper and rub all over the duck, inside and out. Turn the duck breast-side down and pop in the oven for an hour., Remove the tray from the oven. Carefully spoon all the fat out of the tray and strain through a sieve into a bowl. Leave to cool. Turn the duck over and place it back in the oven for another hour., After the duck has had 2 hours, remove the tray from the oven and, once again, spoon the fat out of the tray and into the bowl. Leave the duck to cool completely., Once cool, cut the duck into 4 portions by carefully cutting off the breasts and legs, discarding the carcass. Place in a tall, sterilised jar and push down on the duck to make it a compact layer. Pour the duck fat over the duck, ensuring it is completely covered and seal the jar. Store in the fridge for up to two weeks., When ready to use the duck, break and remove the fat layer – don’t throw it away though, keep it for roast potatoes. Place the duck in an oven heated to 200°C/400ºF/gas 6 for 20 minutes or until crisp and tender., I love serving my duck with noodles. All that needs doing is to bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Add the pak choi, sugar snaps and noodles and cook for 4 minutes. Drain and toss with the chilli, sesame oil, lime juice, coriander leaves and some seasoning. Serve with the duck., If you are going to eat the duck immediately, roast it for 2 hours as described above, then turn the oven temperature up to 200°C/400ºF/gas 6 and cook for another 15 minutes."

Wash the duck, inside and out, and pat dry with kitchen paper. Place it breast-side up in a roasting tray, and stuff with the orange halves and herbs. Rub a good pinch of salt and pepper inside and outside the duck. Turn the duck breast-side down and roast in the oven for an hour., After an hour, remove the tray from the oven, carefully spoon out any excess fat, turn the duck over and pop it back in the oven for another hour. After the second hour, remove the duck from the oven and leave it to cool. Strip off all the meat using a fork or your fingers, pile it on a plate and leave to one side., To make the pie, heat a large casserole pot over a medium heat and add a splash of olive oil. Add the onion, celery and carrots and cook gently for 20 minutes, until softened. Add the shredded duck meat, flour, rhubarb and beef stock, and cook down for 15 minutes until you get a lovely thick stew., Meanwhile, boil the potatoes and swede together in plenty of salted water until cooked, then drain and mash with the butter and milk. Season well with salt and pepper and put to one side., When the stew is cooked, transfer it to a deep earthenware baking dish. Grate over half the clove of garlic, a little orange zest and a handful of Parmesan, then give it a good stir. Heat the oven again to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 again. Spread the mash over the top, creating little peaks with the back of a spoon, then pop it in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, until brown and crispy on top."

Serve everything on a big platter in the middle of the table so everyone can build their own little lettuce cup parcels full of duck, herbs and cherries., There are loads of colours and textures here, and if you can get hold of some beautiful purple shiso cress, all the better. It has a kind of curry flavour and looks amazing., Heat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Wash the duck and wipe it dry, inside and out, with kitchen paper. Season well with salt and pepper, both inside and out. Place the duck on a roasting tray, and roast it in the oven for 2 hours., While the duck is in the oven make the cherry sauce. Pit all the cherries. Put half to one side and place the other half in a food processor with a good pinch of salt and pepper, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil., Once the duck is cooked, allow it to cool slightly before removing the skin to a clean baking tray. Pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves and sprinkle all over the skin with the cinnamon and cloves. Place the skin back into the hot oven for about 10 minutes to crisp up nicely., Next, get yourself a lovely big serving board. Carefully break the lettuces into individual leaves and give them a good wash. Shred the spring onions. Cut the cucumber in half lengthways and use a spoon to scoop out the seeds before chopping it into little sticks. Halve and deseed the chillies, then finely slice them. Pick the mint leaves and snip the cress., Shred the duck with your hands or a couple of forks, and pile the meat in the middle of your board. Place everything else around the serving board in individual piles. Put your sauce into a serving bowl and pop it onto the board next to a pile of pitted cherries. Finish by roughly slicing up the crispy skin and scattering it over the board before serving."

To really get the flavours going, you could keep this in your fridge to marinate for up to 2 days. Then get yourself a pan, casserole or high-sided roasting tray that snugly fits the duck legs. Place the chillies, plums and sugar in the bottom of the tray and then pour the marinade from the bag over the top. Mix it all up using your fingers, and place the duck legs on top., Place the tray in a preheated oven at 170°C/325°F/gas 3 for 2 to 2½ hours until the meat falls away from the bone. Remove the star anise and cinnamon stick, then taste the sauce to see if it needs to be seasoned with a little more soy sauce. It’s now down to you how you would like to serve it. You could have it as a starter with some of the little Chinese pancakes that you can buy, or served simply with rice or noodles and the chunky, jammy plum sauce that the duck has cooked in."

Put in a medium-hot frying pan and fry very gently for 5 minutes, turning halfway, until lots of fat has come out of the skin and the skin is golden brown. Take out of the pan and slice thinly – the duck will still be raw in the middle but don’t worry! Discard the fat from the pan and put the sliced duck back in. Stir fry for a few minutes, until cooked through and crispy. Set aside., Mix the pomegranate seeds, spring onions, coriander, watercress, mango and crispy duck together. Dress with the lime juice and a drizzle of sesame oil. Season to taste., Separate the lettuce leaves and arrange on plates. Top with the dressed salad to serve."

Bizarrely enough, the fact that my parents ran a pub restaurant meant that we very rarely went out for dinner as a family, but when we did, my old man used to take us out to this Chinese restaurant in Sawbridgeworth where we all fell in love with Peking duck., There are hundreds of ways of cooking duck in Asian cultures – steamed, roasted, pumped up with bicycle pumps to remove the meat from the skin – but we're at home and so we can't do with all this mucking about. My way is simple and it works..., Preheat the oven to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3. Rub a nice 1.2kg duck with loads of salt, inside and out. Dust the bird all over with five-spice and, if you've got any, grate some fresh ginger and rub it round the cavity, leaving the ginger inside to flavour. Place the duck in a roasting tray and put it in the oven. All you need to do is check on it every so often and spoon away the excess fat that has rendered out of the duck. This will make the skin go wonderfully crispy. Generally, after a couple of hours it will be perfect – the leg meat will pull off the bone and the skin will be wonderfully crisp. You don't always need to, but I sometimes turn the heat up to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6 for a short while until it's really crispy., While this beautiful bird is cooking, you can make your plum sauce. Chuck 10 or 12 destoned plums into a pan with 5 tablespoons of sugar, a couple of pinches of five-spice, a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce, half a teaspoon of chilli powder and a splash of water. Bring to the boil, then simmer until you get a nice shiny pulp. You can remove the plum skins if you want to, but I usually leave them in. Sometimes I add a little grated orange zest, as this goes well with duck. Put the sauce to one side to cool before serving it, and taste to check the seasoning., As for the spring onions and cucumber, that's straightforward. Use half a cucumber and a bunch of spring onions and finely slice them. I strongly advise buying a couple of packs of pre-made pancakes which you can place in a steamer or microwave and slowly steam until nice and hot. The bamboo steamers are only a few quid from Chinese supermarkets, so it's worth getting hold of some and they're great to serve at the table., Once the duck has cooled a little bit, use two forks to shred all the meat off the carcass. I remember the Chinese lady at the restaurant in Sawbridgeworth doing this. You can do the same, putting all the meat with its crispy skin on to a serving plate. Take a pancake, place some duck, a bit of spring onion, a little cucumber and a dollop of plum sauce on to it, then roll it up – lovely."
