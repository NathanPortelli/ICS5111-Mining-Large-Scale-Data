Divide the mixture into eight even-sized balls and pat into 3cm-thick patties., Put two large non-stick frying pans on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil in each (or cook in batches). Cook four fishcakes in each pan, for 5 minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through, carefully turning with a fish slice – if they break or crack a little don’t stress, these are light, chunky, rough-and-ready fishcakes., Meanwhile, peel 1 cucumber, halve lengthways and scrape out the watery core, then slice ½ cm thick. Remove any tatty outer leaves from 1 iceberg lettuce, and roughly chop it into 1cm chunks., In a bowl, dress both with 1 heaped teaspoon of English mustard, 4 heaped tablespoons of yoghurt and 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar, mixing well, then taste, season to perfection, and crumble over 40g of feta cheese. Pick, roughly chop and stir through most of the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh mint (15g)., Serve the fishcakes and salsa scattered with baby mint leaves, with a good portion of salad and wedges of lemon, for squeezing over."

Plus, using tinned fish also turns this dish into a speedy weeknight winner, which you can get on the table in under half an hour. ”",217,7g,2.1g,4.6g,0.73g,14.8g,25.6g,4.5g,"2                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                ripe tomatoes                                                                                                                                                                , (200g), 1 x 120                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                sardine fillets in olive oil, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                baby spinach, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried wholewheat spaghetti, 1                                                                                                                                                                bulb of                                                                                                                                                                fennel, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemons, 20                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                ricotta salata, 1                                                                                                                                                                pinch of                                                                                                                                                                dried chilli flakes","Halve 2 large ripe tomatoes (200g total), scoop out and discard the seeds, then place in a blender. Add 1 x 120g tin of sardine fillets (and their oil), then blitz until super-smooth, adding a splash of water to loosen, if needed., Roughly slice 200g of baby spinach, then place in a large colander in the sink., Cook 300g of wholewheat spaghetti in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions., Pick and reserve any leafy tops from 1 bulb of fennel, then very finely slice the stalks and bulb, ideally on a mandolin (use the guard!). Add the fennel to the spaghetti pan for the last few minutes of cooking., Reserving a mugful of cooking water, drain the spaghetti and fennel over the spinach in the colander, so that the spinach starts to wilt. Return the pasta, fennel and spinach to the pan, and toss with the sardine sauce., Squeeze in the juice from 1 lemon, loosening with a splash of cooking water, if needed., Season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, finely grate over 20g of ricotta salata (see ingredient note below) and a little lemon zest, then sprinkle over any reserved fennel tops and 1 pinch of dried chilli flakes., Cut the remaining lemon into wedges for squeezing over, then serve immediately."

Loosen 2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard with a splash of vinegar, then brush over the skin side of the fish, and sprinkle over 1 tablespoon of porridge oats., Remove the skin from the beets and finely slice them, ideally on a mandolin (use the guard!), then arrange them around the fish, overlapping the slices and tucking them up to and under the fillets in a nice even layer., Mix 1 tablespoon of vinegar with 1 teaspoon of oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper to make a dressing., Holding ½ a bunch of fresh thyme like a brush, use it to dab the dressing all over the beets, then strip over the leaves. Cook at the top of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the fish is lightly golden and cooked through., Toss 2 large handfuls of rocket with a squeeze of juice from ½ a lemon and sprinkle over the top. Stir 2 teaspoons of jarred grated horseradish through the 2 tablespoons of natural yoghurt, season to perfection, then spoon over the fish and tuck in."

surface and remove the tough outer layer. Peel the shallot and ginger, deseed the chillies, then roughly chop everything with the lemongrass. Add to a large pestle and mortar with a good pinch of sea salt and the lime leaves (discard the stalks) and pound to a paste., Toast the peanuts in a large frying pan over a medium heat for 3 minutes, or until golden, then bash half into the paste. Add the tomato purée and fish sauce, finely grate in the lime zest and squeeze in all the juice, then muddle together., With a sharp knife, score the sea bass skin at 1cm intervals in a criss-cross fashion, then rub all over with the paste, both inside and out., Get your banana leaf (if using), or tear off a piece of baking paper five times as long as the fish and fold it in half to give you double thickness. Place the fish in the middle, then fold over to seal the fish snuggly inside. Place on a large baking tray and roast for 25 minutes, or until the flesh is succulent and comes away easily from the bone., To make the rice, drizzle the vegetable oil into a saucepan over a medium heat. Crumble in the creamed coconut, then squeeze in the lime juice, throwing in the squeezed lime halves. Tip in the rice and fry for 2 minutes, then pour over 1 mug of boiling water and turn down the heat to low. Cover and cook for 12 minutes, then remove from the heat and allow to steam for a further 3 minutes., For the chilli pickle, finely slice the chillies and place in a small bowl with the sugar, vinegar and a pinch of salt, then mix together and leave aside., Now make the salad. Crack open the coconut and finely grate 50g of flesh into a serving bowl. Halve the sugar snaps and mangetout, finely shred both cabbages and cucumber, then peel and finely slice the mango and add it all to the bowl. Pick in most of the herb leaves, squeeze over the lime juice and toss together., Pop the fish on a serving platter. Roughly crush the remaining peanuts in a pestle and mortar, then scatter over the salad and the fish. Drizzle the fish with the soy sauce and scatter over the remaining salad herbs., Take the fish, chilli pickle, rice and salad to the table and let everyone help themselves."

(The skin should be beautifully crisp and the flesh blushing in the middle.) Remove to a plate to rest., Meanwhile, place a large handful of the watercress in a blender with the juice of half the lemon and 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Blitz until smooth, then fold in the yoghurt. Season with black pepper and tip into a small bowl., Finely slice the cucumber, spring onion and avocado, then dress with a little lemon juice and some black pepper., Lightly toast the bread and spread each slice with the watercress yoghurt. Top each with some avocado, cucumber and spring onion slices. Break the crispy trout skin into shards and the fish into chunks. Divide the trout pieces between the toasts and top with the crispy skin., Snip over some cress and serve with the remaining watercress on the side and a handful of your favourite crisps, if you like."

Make some effort when you buy the tomatoes, and have a look around for green, yellow and cherry tomatoes, a whole mixture. Get some good ones and this dish will blow you away. ”",572,23.9g,2.4g,6.7g,1.8g,44.5g,43.9g,4.2g,"8                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red mullet fillets                                                                                                                                                                , (100g each), scaled and pin-boned, from sustainable sources, plain flour                                                                                                                                                                , for dusting, olive oil, TOMATO SALAD, 3                                                                                                                                                                big handfuls of                                                                                                                                                                mixed-colour tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                 fresh dill                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), or fennel tops, CRISPY BREADCRUMBS, 4                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh thyme, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                stale breadcrumbs, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    dried red chillies, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon","Chop the tomatoes into irregular chunks and tip into a big bowl with a couple of glugs of extra virgin olive oil and a splash of vinegar., Season the tomatoes with sea salt and black pepper, then taste, tweak, taste, tweak... I usually add a bit more vinegar, salt or extra virgin olive oil until the tomatoes and their juices sing in my mouth. This is a normal thing to do, so just be confident!, Pick and finely chop the basil and dill and mix into the tomatoes., Season the fish fillets, then dip them in a little flour to dust them on both sides, shaking off any excess., Drizzle a glug of olive oil into a frying pan over a medium-high heat and, once hot, place the fish skin-side down in the pan, lightly pressing the fillets down using a fish slice., Fry the fish for 3 minutes, or until the skin is bright orangey golden and crisp. Turn the fish over and fry for 1 minute on the other side, or until just cooked. Remove the fish to a plate while you make the crispy breadcrumbs., Drizzle a little olive oil to the juices in the pan, then strip in the thyme leaves, add the breadcrumbs, crumble up the chilli and finely grate in the lemon zest. Toss around and fry  for 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly golden and crispy., Divide the tomato salad between four plates and either lay 2 fish fillets over the top of each salad, or break the fillets up and scatter over the tomatoes. I like to put the hot and crispy breadcrumbs in a little bowl with a teaspoon in them and sprinkle it over my guests’ plates at the table – delicious."

This will only take a minute. When the spinach is done, remove from the colander and gently squeeze out any excess moisture., Drain the potatoes in the colander. Remove the eggs, cool under cold water, then peel and quarter them. Place to one side., Peel and finely chop the onion, then peel, halve and finely chop the carrot., In a separate pan, slowly fry the onion and carrot in a little oil for about 5 minutes, then add the double cream and bring just to the boil., Remove from the heat and finely grate in 2 good handfuls of cheese, then squeeze in the lemon juice and stir through the mustard., Pick and finely chop the parsley and stir into the cream mixture., Slice the fish into strips then place in an earthenware dish with the spinach and eggs and mix together, pouring over the creamy vegetable sauce., The cooked potatoes should be drained and mashed – add a bit of oil, sea salt, black pepper and a touch of nutmeg (if using). Spread on top of the fish. Don’t bother piping it to make it look pretty – it’s a homely hearty thing., Place in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden., Serve with some nice peas or greens, not forgetting your baked beans and tomato ketchup. Tacky but tasty, and that’s what I like."
Seared tuna steak | Jamie Oliver fish & seafood recipe,With fresh coriander & basil,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/89080404.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In15 minutes,"“When buying tuna you should look for meat that is evenly coloured, dark red and has a fine, tight grain free of large sinews. Generally you get better tuna in good fishmongers than in supermarkets, but sometimes the supermarkets get a good batch in, so keep your eyes peeled. There is a bit of a thing about it being fashionable to serve tuna pink; if you buy good-quality fresh tuna the last thing you want to do is cook it all the way through and make it taste like tinned tuna, so yes, good-quality fresh tuna should be served rare or very pink. ”",243,1.8g,0.5g,0.2g,0.9g,57.1g,0.4g,0.6g,"1                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                 dried red chilli, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                coriander seeds, ½                                                                                                                                                                a clove of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 1                                                                                                                                                                good handful of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil, 1                                                                                                                                                                good handful of                                                                                                                                                                fresh coriander, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 4 x 225                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                tuna steaks                                                                                                                                                                , ideally 2cm thick, from sustainable sources","Smash up the chilli and the coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar., Peel and chop the garlic, pick and finely chop the herb leaves and add it all to the pestle and mortar with a drizzle of oil and lemon juice, to taste. Mix together, and season with sea salt and black pepper., Lay out your tuna steaks on a tray, season both sides and rub all over with the herb mixture., There are two nice ways to cook it: I prefer to cook it on a griddle pan or in a frying pan., Your pan should be very, very hot. Put in the tuna and what you want to do is sear it so that it toasts, fries and browns (about 45 to 60 seconds on each side)., Once cooked, I like to rip the steaks in half and serve with salad and chips or boiled potatoes and a big wedge of lemon. It’s quite sexy sometimes with some marinated sun-dried tomatoes, olives, basil… The possibilities are endless."

Toss around, then season to taste with sea salt and black pepper., Add or finely grate in the horseradish, tasting as you go, then finely chop the parsley and chives and throw these into the bowl., Trim, finely slice and add the spring onions, tear in the smoked trout, and mix together., Now it’s very important to balance your salad with more seasoning and maybe an extra squeeze of lemon juice. You may even want to give it more of a kick by adding some extra horseradish. Personally, I love to add a lot of horseradish and make it really hot., Great served as a starter, salad or even dinner if you love it as much as I do."

until softened., Peel and roughly chop the garlic and ginger, and roughly chop the pandan., Place the softened goraka (or tamarind paste), garlic, ginger and pandan in a pestle and mortar, along with the cinnamon, black pepper, curry leaves and a good pinch of salt. Give it a good bash until everything has broken down., Add 3 tablespoons of boiling water and muddle to make a smooth paste., Cut the tuna into 6 even chunks, rub all over with the paste, then leave to marinate for 20 minutes., Meanwhile, for the rice, peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then place in a shallow pan on a medium heat with the butter. Roughly chop the pandan and add to the pan. Tear in the curry leaves, then give everything a good stir and cook for 8 minutes or until softened, but not coloured., Stir in the turmeric, add the rice and cook for a few minutes more., Pour in 2 mugfuls (300ml) of boiling water, season with a good pinch of sea salt, then pop the lid and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed. Turn off the heat and leave it to steam for a further 10 minutes., Line a lidded clay pot or a small cast iron pan with a piece of banana leaf. Pop the fish in the bottom in a single layer, then cover with another piece of banana leaf, and the lid. Place the pan on the hob over a low heat and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until just cooked through., To make the sambal, deseed and finely chop the tomatoes, and trim and finely slice the chilli (deseed if you like). Scrape out the coconut with a fork (about 100g) and combine in a bowl with the tomato and chilli. Finely zest over the limes, then squeeze in the juice and season to taste., Line 2 plates with banana leaves and arrange a little bit of everything on each. Garnish with extra shaved coconut and chilli flakes, if you like."

casserole pan on a high heat and a 26cm non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat., Put 250g of smoked haddock and 4 fresh bay leaves into the casserole pan and cover with boiling water. Pop 200g of focaccia on the very bottom shelf of the grill to toast., Beat 8 large eggs in a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Trim and finely slice 6 spring onions and the top leafy part of ½ a bunch of fresh mint and mix into the eggs, along with 1 large handful of frozen peas., Use a fish slice to remove the fish to a bowl, then flake with a fork, discarding the skin., Turn the heat under the frying pan up to high, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and pour in the egg mixture., Stir for a minute until it begins to set. Sprinkle over the poached haddock, finely grate over 5g of Parmesan then put the pan under the grill on the top shelf until cooked through, fluffy and golden (roughly 5 minutes)., On a nice large board, matchstick or coarsely grate 2 apples, then quickly squeeze over some lemon juice to stop them discolouring., Finely chop ½ a bunch of fresh chives and sprinkle them over the apple., Crumble over 1 handful of walnuts, add 75g of watercress and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, then toss together and season to taste., Speed-peel 30g of Emmental over the top. Get the frittata and focaccia out from under the grill and serve straight away with lemon wedges."

Chris and Dawn first tried red snapper on their Caribbean honeymoon, and we’ve recreated it for them here – lovingly marinated overnight, then roasted in the oven, complete with all the trimmings! The scotch bonnets are, I think, an essential part of the marinade – if you’re feeling (really) brave, leave the seeds in, but equally, if you want to be cautious, you could just use half the amount of chilli.

the Scotch bonnet and pepper, peel the garlic, trim and quarter the spring onions, then place it all in a blender with the basil, half the coriander and the celery leaves (if using). Melt and add the coconut oil and whiz to a paste, loosening with a good splash of water, if needed., Use a sharp knife to score the fish all over on both sides, about 1cm deep. Rub over the marinade, getting it into all the slashes, then cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 4 hours., For the salsa, deseed and finely chop the peppers. Cut a cross into the bottom of each tomato, plunge them into boiling water for 40 seconds, then peel away the skin., Peel the red onion and garlic, trim the cucumber, then finely chop it all with most of the remaining coriander, mixing as you go., Scrape into a bowl, stir in the vinegar and hot pepper sauce, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., To make the beignets, chop the breadfruit into large wedges and cook in boiling salted water with the lid ajar for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender, then drain., Remove the skin and core, then mash while hot with the butter. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the salsa, then season to perfection., Divide the mixture into 20 balls, then roll them in the breadcrumbs and place on a tray. Put aside., Just under half fill a large sturdy pan with oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go., Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7, and preheat a large ovenproof frying pan or non-stick roasting tray on a high heat on the hob., Put in the snapper to char and colour for 2 minutes on each side, then transfer to the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cooked through. To test if it’s done, insert a small, sharp knife into the thickest part just behind the head – the fish should flake away., While it cooks, peel the plantain and halve lengthways. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a frying pan on a medium-high heat, and cook the plantain for 2 minutes on each side, or until golden. Season., Carefully drop 6 beignets into the hot vegetable oil and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden, crisp and they rise to the surface. Scoop out and drain on kitchen paper (freeze the rest before frying, to defrost and cook fresh another day)., Serve the fish with the salsa, beignets and plantain.

sea salt and black pepper, squeeze over the juice of 1 lime and set aside for 10 minutes., Pick and finely chop most of the fresh coriander leaves for the dip (reserving some for a garnish) and stir through the yoghurt in a small bowl., Peel and crush the garlic, and add to the yoghurt along with the zest of the clementine half. Season to taste and set aside., Crush the chipotle flakes using a pestle and mortar. Transfer to a large, shallow dish with the ground coriander, cornflour and a pinch of salt, then mix well. Pour the milk into a separate bowl., Pour the oil into a large, thick-bottomed saucepan to a depth of around 6cm (it should be no more than two-thirds full). Heat it to 170ºC/325ºF (if you don’t have a thermometer, dip the end of a wooden spoon in the oil – if it starts bubbling rapidly around the spoon, it’s ready)., Slice the clementines as thinly as you can – about 1mm. This can be fiddly, so don’t worry about getting perfect rounds., Pat the fish and clementine slices with kitchen paper to soak up any excess juice. Coat them in the cornflour, then dip briefly in the milk before coating again in flour, shaking off the excess., Deep fry the fish and clementine in batches for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden., Drain on kitchen paper and scatter with salt, chipotle and the reserved coriander. Serve immediately with the dip and the remaining lime cut into wedges."

Place the potato on a small baking tray and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until soft in the middle. 
Slice in half, scoop the flesh into a bowl (you should have roughly 350g); the skin can be discarded (or eaten!). Roughly mash the flesh and set aside to cool. Turn the oven down to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Bring a small pan filled with plenty of water to the boil over a high heat. Add the quinoa and cook for 14 to 15 minutes, or until it’s cooked but still retains a bite. Drain and stir through the potato., Add 3 tablespoons of oil to a medium frying pan and place over a medium–high heat., Peel and finely chop the onion. Once the pan is hot, add the onion and a pinch of sea salt and fry for 8 minutes, or until soft and caramelised, stirring frequently., Stir in the cumin, caraway and chilli flakes for 1 minute, then add the onion and spices to the potato and quinoa., Flake the mackerel into 1 to 2cm pieces, pick and roughly chop the herbs and beat the egg; add it all to the mixture along with ¾ of a teaspoon of salt, the zest of 1½ lemons and plenty of freshly ground black pepper., Mix to combine. Shape the mixture into 12 patties 6 to 7cm wide and 2 to 3cm thick, then set aside., Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a large frying pan and place over a medium–high heat. Once hot, add half the patties and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden-brown on both sides, carefully turning halfway through., Remove from the pan and place on a lined baking tray. Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan and continue with the remaining patties in the same way. Finish them off in the oven for about 8 minutes, or until cooked through., Cut the remaining lemon into wedges and serve with the hot patties along with soured cream for dipping, if you like."

heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and half the butter. Pick in the oregano leaves and cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly., Add the spinach and cook for a further 15 to 20 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated, still stirring regularly. Remove from the heat, taste, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper and allow to cool., Meanwhile, make the sauce: wash, trim and finely slice the leek, then place in a large pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, the remaining butter and the sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for 15 minutes, or until sweet and tender, stirring regularly., Pour in the wine and let it bubble and cook away, then stir in the flour and, splash by splash, stir in the milk. Leave it to simmer for 5 minutes, then liquidize in a blender until silky smooth., Grate in the cheese, add a pinch of cayenne and blitz again to combine. Taste and season to perfection, then leave to cool completely., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7 and place a large baking sheet inside to heat up., On a large sheet of flour-dusted greaseproof paper, roll out the pastry so it’s 10cm bigger than your salmon all the way round., Pour away any excess liquid from the cooled spinach mixture, then spoon it on to the middle of the pastry and spread it across the surface, leaving a 3cm border at the edges. Place the salmon in the middle, then roll up the sides of the pastry to create the crust, going right up to the salmon and pinching it at the corners to secure it in place., Lightly score the top of the salmon in a criss-cross fashion, then pour the cool cheesy sauce over the fish. Brush the exposed pastry with beaten egg, then carefully lift the greaseproof and salmon en croûte on to the preheated tray., Bake at the bottom of the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. This is delicious served with a garden salad and lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over."

Pop a weight on top to help pack everything down evenly, then put the whole thing into the fridge for 36 hours. Please use your instincts here – if you have a particularly chunky side of salmon you may want to leave it for up to 48 hours to allow for proper penetration., Once cured, unwrap the fish, then, holding the fillet in place, pour the juices down the sink and rub away all the salty topping (it’s messy, so you might want to wear gloves)., Pat the fillet dry with kitchen paper, then tightly wrap in clingfilm (sometimes I like to cover the salmon with freshly picked dill before wrapping, for bonus flavour). Put back into the fridge until needed, where it will keep happily for up to 2 weeks., To serve, use a long sharp knife to slice the salmon thinly at an angle and, as the knife touches the skin each time, kink it off, lifting away the salmon., Arrange the slices on a board or platter as you go. Delicious with a simple salad and good wholemeal sourdough, as part of a seafood platter, served up at a party or even as part of a festive brekkie spread."
Jumbo fish fingers | Fish recipes | Jamie Oliver recipes,Golden crispy breadcrumbs,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/51137579.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['10', 'portions']",plus cooking,"“Something as humble and everyday as a fish finger can be made more nutritious if you make your own, and even better, you can go jumbo in size. I like to use salmon, but white fish works just as well. It's the perfect family favourite to have in the freezer. I’ve used a side of salmon here, but you can absolutely scale this down according to how many fillets you have.

The nature of the shape of the salmon side means that they won’t be uniform in size, but that’s all part of their charm.

In a shallow bowl, whisk the eggs with the paprika and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Tear the bread into a food processor, grate in the cheese, add 2 tablespoons of oil, season with sea salt and black pepper, and whiz until you have breadcrumbs (see below for some exciting addition ideas), then tip into a baking tray., Turn each fish portion in the flour until evenly coated, dip it in the egg mixture, letting any excess drip off, then turn it in the breadcrumbs until well coated all over. Transfer to a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, layering them up between sheets of paper until all of the fish is coated., Cook right away or freeze in the tray – once frozen, you can pop them into a tub or sandwich bags for easier storage., To cook, place however many jumbo fish fingers you need on a roasting tray and cook in a preheated oven at 200°C/400°F/gas 6 for 15 minutes from fresh, or 20 minutes from frozen, or until golden and cooked through., Something as humble and everyday as a fish finger can be made even more nutritious if you make your own, and even better, you can go jumbo in size!

Transfer to a pan lined with parchment paper, layering them up between sheets of paper until they’re all coated.

Ask your fishmonger to kill it for you, or if you’re happy doing it yourself, place the live lobster in the freezer for 30 minutes, so it’s docile., When ready to cook, carefully and swiftly place the lobster in a large pan of boiling water head first, pop the lid on and cook for 8 minutes., Remove, cool, and carefully halve the lobster, then remove the meat to a bowl – save the claws to decorate, if you like, or, even better, crack, pull out the meat and add it to the bowl., Put all the shells back into the empty pan you cooked the lobster in and bash with a rolling pin, then pour in the milk and simmer on a low heat for 15 to 20 minutes to impart unbelievable flavour., Meanwhile, peel the onion and carrot, trim the fennel, wash the leek, finely chop it all and place in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and half the butter. Cook for 15 minutes, or until soft and sticky, stirring regularly., Stir in the flour, followed by the mustard and Prosecco. Let the alcohol bubble and cook away, then strain and gradually stir in the milk and simmer until you have a nice, loose, silky consistency., Remove from the heat, grate in the Lancashire cheese, taste, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper and leave to cool., Peel the potatoes, cutting up any larger ones so they’re all a similar size, then cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 15 to 20 minutes, or until cooked through., Drain in a colander and leave to steam dry, then return to the pan and mash well with the remaining butter and the grated Red Leicester. Season to perfection with sea salt and cayenne, loosening with a splash of milk, if needed., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Remove any tough stalks from the greens, then finely chop and sprinkle into a baking dish (30cm x 35cm)., Slice all the fish into bite-sized pieces and add to the dish, halve and add the prawns (deveining, if needed), then dot the lobster meat in and around. Pour over the sauce, top with the mash, then drizzle lightly with oil and poke in your lobster claws (if using)., Bake for 1 hour, or until golden, bubbling and the fish is cooked through."

Pick in the basil leaves and blitz until finely chopped., Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil–you need just enough to give it an oozy consistency – then finely grate and stir through the Parmesan. Give the mixture a final blitz, then halve the lemon and add a squeeze of juice to taste, then season with a pinch of black pepper., Scrub the potatoes, then trim the beans and broccoli. Cook the potatoes in a large pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until tender, adding the beans and the broccoli for the final 5 minutes., Meanwhile, heat a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Rub the salmon fillets all over with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place in the hot pan, skin-side down, turn the heat down to medium and cook for 4 minutes, or until the skin is golden and crisp., Turn the fillets over, then cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes, or until just cooked through. Remove the pan from the heat, rest for 30 seconds, then add a good squeeze of lemon juice and give the pan a shake., Drain the vegetables well, then tip into a large bowl. Add the pesto, then toss to coat., Divide the salmon and vegetables between plates, drizzle over the pan juices, then cut the remaining lemon into wedges for squeezing over."

Refresh under cold running water., Transfer the rice and greens to your lunchbox., Halve and destone the avocado, then use a fork to mash the flesh in its skin. Add a little splash of soy sauce, the wasabi paste and the juice from 1 lime., Keep your spiked avocado in its skin and use it as a container.

Transfer to a plate, allow to cool, then remove the skins., Place the chipotle and ancho chillies in a small bowl. Pour over boiling water to just cover and leave for 15 minutes to soak. Drain in a colander, reserving the liquid., Place the chillies, garlic, oregano and a large pinch of sea salt in a food processor and blend to a paste. Add the lime juice and 4 tablespoons of the reserved liquid and blitz to combine. Transfer to a non-reactive bowl., Place the fish in the marinade, cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes., For the salad, halve the tomatoes and slice the cucumber and spring onions. Halve, destone and roughly chop the avocado. Combine in a bowl with 3 tablespoons of oil and the lime juice. Season well., Preheat a barbecue or cast-iron griddle pan to a medium heat. Remove the fish from the refrigerator and cook, turning once, for about 3 minutes each side, occasionally adding some more marinade with a brush during cooking., Divide the fish among plates and serve with the avocado salad and freshly squeezed lime wedges."

Cook the rice according to the packet instructions, then drain and rinse under cold water. Set aside while you work on your fish., Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Slash the mullet skin three to four times (don’t cut too far into the flesh). Pop a few sprigs of lemon thyme into each cavity and season well., Wrap the head of each fish in a slice of pancetta and drizzle with a little olive oil. Pop the fish on a large roasting tin and roast for 12 minutes, or until cooked through., Meanwhile, make your tapenade. Drain and soak the olives in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes. Drain well, then remove the stones., Peel the garlic, then bash in a pestle and mortar with the dried chilli flakes and fennel seeds until fine. Tip into a bowl., Roughly chop the almonds, olives and sundried tomato and add to the bowl, followed by the spice mix and extra virgin olive oil., Tip the rice into a large bowl. Halve and bash the pomegranate with a spoon so the seeds fall into the bowl., Pick, chop and add the mint and parsley leaves along with the lemon zest and a squeeze of juice. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Mix well., When the fish is cooked, remove it from the oven and leave to rest for 2 minutes., Arrange the rice on a platter, lay the fish on top and serve with the tapenade on the side."

roasting tin. Cover with cold water and place the fish kettle or tin over two hobs., Peel and roughly chop the onion and carrots, and trim the celery, then place in the water with the salmon. Add the bay leaves and the black and pink peppercorns, then cover with a lid or tin foil and bring to the boil., Once boiling, switch off the heat and allow the water and salmon to cool – it’ll take around 5 hours., To make the pickled red onions, peel and finely slice them, using a mandolin if you have one (use the guard!), then place in a small bowl. Add the red wine vinegar and a pinch of sea salt, scrunch together, then set aside to allow the onions to lightly pickle., To make the rhubarb sauce, trim the rhubarb and peel and core the apple, then chop into 2cm pieces., Place the fruit in a pan with the honey, bay and whole cloves, add a splash of vinegar and the orange juice, then bring to the boil and turn down to medium. Cover and leave to cook for about 30 minutes, or until the rhubarb has softened. Add a little extra honey to sweeten, if needed. Leave to cool., To make the mayonnaise, first make a tarragon oil. Pick the tarragon leaves into a blender, add 100ml of oil and blitz to a paste. Add the rest of the oil and blitz again, then strain through a piece of muslin into a jug., Place the egg yolks in a mixing bowl with the mustard and whisk well. Very slowly drip the tarragon oil into the egg yolk as you whisk; when you’ve added half of the oil, add 1 tablespoon of vinegar, then continue whisking in the oil (you might not need all of it). Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and black pepper., Carefully remove the salmon to a serving board and gently remove the skin. Break up the salmon flesh and arrange on a large platter, drizzling with a little oil, if you like., Pick the herb leaves over the onions and toss well., Serve the poached salmon with the pickled onions, rhubarb sauce and tarragon mayo on the side –  delicious with boiled new potatoes."

Gently fold them into the yoghurt dressing., Top each piece of dab with some of the dressed asparagus then pour over any leftover yoghurt dressing and sprinkle over the remaining Cheddar., Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until everything is slightly browned on top and the fish is beautifully cooked through., Scatter with the remaining dill, then serve up."

baking tray with foil, then brush with a little oil., Peel the garlic clove. Pick and roughly chop the coriander leaves and finely chop the stalks., Put the fish on the tray. Grind the garlic and coriander stalks to a paste with a pestle and mortar, then stir in the dried spices and 1 tablespoon of oil., Cover the fish with the herb paste, turn the grill down to medium, then grill for 8 minutes, turning halfway through – it’s done when the flesh is opaque and flakes easily. When it’s nearly cooked, heat up the naan, if using., Meanwhile, prepare the salad. Trim, separate out and roughly chop the lettuce leaves, trim and roughly chop the spring onions, then deseed and finely slice the chilli. Cut the lemon into wedges., Toss the coriander leaves, baby gem, spring onion and most of the chilli in a bowl with a squeeze of lemon juice, a splash of oil and some seasoning., Arrange the salad on a serving plate, place the fish on top, skin-side up, and spoon over the chutney.

Check on it the next day, spooning any cure that has slipped off back over the salmon, then re-wrap it and place back in the fridge for one more night., On the third day, take the salmon out of the fridge and carefully unwrap it so you can rinse off the cure., Use a spoon to gently push the blackberry cure off the fish, then gently rinse off the residual cure with about 100ml of cold water, pouring a splash at a time over your salmon. Put the salmon to one side and rinse the tray under the tap., For the herb cure, pick and finely chop the dill and tarragon, then mix with the sloe gin in a bowl., Put the salmon back onto the clean tray, skin-side down, and pack the herby cure onto the fish using your hands. Make sure you cover all the flesh – you don’t want any air getting to it., Wrap it again with a double layer of greaseproof paper, then a tight layer of clingfilm. Pop the salmon back in the fridge overnight., The next day your salmon will be perfectly cured and ready to eat. You don’t need to rinse off the second cure – simply slice the salmon as finely as you can on an angle, so you get thin slices of gravlax tinged with pink and topped with herbs., Delicious served with slices of buttered sourdough, crispy crackers, slices of cucumber, sour cream, and some lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Lay the salmon skin-side down in the dish, spoon over the soy and honey and sprinkle with togarashi seasoning., Place under the grill to cook for 15 to 18 minutes until dark, sticky and the salmon flakes easily when prodded. Remove from the grill, squeeze over the lime juice, and set aside., In a small dry frying pan, fry the sesame seeds over a medium heat until just toasted, then set aside., To make the dressing, finely grate the lime zest into a large bowl, then squeeze in the juice from 1. Add the orange zest and juice, peel and grate in the ginger, then crush in the garlic. Whisk with the soy and oil until combined., Shred and add the seaweed and spring onion and toss to coat.

Mash the leftover potatoes or push through a sieve, then season with sea salt and black pepper., Beat the egg yolk and chop the wild garlic or chives, then add to the potatoes with the flour. Mix well., Lightly knead, then place the soft dough on the floured surface and roll out to about ½cm thick., Divide the dough into 4 and shape into rounds., Allow to chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or until needed.
Meanwhile, finely grate the horseradish (if using fresh) and combine with the crème fraîche. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, pepper and a dash of extra virgin olive oil., Preheat a flat griddle or non-stick frying pan until very hot, then cook the potato cakes in a little olive oil for 4 to 5 minutes on each side until golden, crisp and hot all the way through., Serve with slices of smoked salmon – or poach the eggs to your liking (2 minutes for soft or 4 minutes for firm) – along with picked watercress leaves dressed with a squeeze of lemon and extra virgin olive oil and a side salad, if you like."

Remove the tough outer leaves from the lemongrass, trim and add to the mortar., Peel, slice and add the garlic and ginger, then slice and add the chilli (if using). Add the lime leaves, then bash them a bit to release the flavours., For each trout, take a large double sheet of newspaper and line with greaseproof paper., Slice 3 limes, then place a line of the slices in the middle of each newspaper. Lay the fish on top and stuff the cavity with half the herby mixture, season with sea salt and drizzle with oil. Top with more lime slices and drizzle with more oil and salt., Wrap up the newspaper and tie with string. Dunk both parcels in a bucket of water and leave to soak for no more than 5 minutes., Barbecue the fish parcels, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until the flesh is firm. The newspaper will be black, but don’t worry – the important thing is that the fish will be cooked to perfection., Remove the fish from the paper, drizzle with any juices, top with coriander leaves and serve with lime wedges."

Season and set aside., Trim, halve and slice the leeks lengthways, then add the butter, oil, bay leaves and thyme to a wide, shallow saucepan, place over a medium-low heat and bring to a simmer. Add the leeks and cook for 10 minutes, turning, until golden., Pour in the stock and wine, cover with a large circle of baking paper and cook for 15 minutes or until leeks are tender. Remove the pan from the heat and rest the leeks in the liquid., Put the capers in a small saucepan and add enough olive oil to cover them by 2cm. Place it over a high heat and fry until the capers begin to open and crisp up. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the capers to a plate lined with kitchen paper., Heat a griddle pan over medium–high heat.

Add the remaining butter and process for 1 minute. Add 100ml of cold water and pulse until large lumps form., Transfer to a lightly floured surface and form into a rough dough. Gently knead with the heel of your hand for about 30 seconds, or until just combined., Flatten to a disc, wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for at least 1 hour., Remove the dough from the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured surface to 5mm thick., Lay the pastry over a 10cm x 35cm tart tin and carefully press into the base and sides. Trim the excess with a sharp knife, then line the case with 4 layers of clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., To blind bake the pastry, fill with ceramic pastry weights, rice or beans and bake for 15 minutes. Lift out the weights using the clingfilm and bake for another 5 minutes, or until the base is dry. Set aside to cool in the tin., To make the filling, peel and finely slice the onion and garlic. Peel, deseed and chop the plum tomatoes., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until softened., Add the tomatoes and tomato purée, pick in the thyme leaves, and cook for 20 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and leave to cool., Place the pastry case on an oven tray and spread the tomato mixture evenly over the base., Crumble over the feta, scatter over the olives, top with the anchovies and drizzle with oil., Bake the tart in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the top has caramelised slightly. Serve warm or cold with a green salad."

and finely slice 2 cloves of garlic and ½ a fresh red chilli (deseed if you like), then peel and finely grate a 2cm piece of ginger. Pick the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh coriander (15g) and finely slice the stalks., Scrape the skin of ¼ of a cucumber with a fork to create grooves, halve it lengthways, then scoop out and discard the seeds. Finely slice into half moons, then place in a bowl and squeeze over the juice of 1 lime. Drizzle over 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and toss together., Put 300g of new potatoes into a pan, cutting any larger potatoes in half, then cook in boiling salted water for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender., Trim and roughly chop 160g of green beans, adding them to the pan for the last 4 minutes. Drain and leave to steam dry., Meanwhile, cut open 1 green tea bag (if using) and sprinkle the tea onto a plate. Add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then roll the salmon in the mixture until completely covered., Place a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, scatter in 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds and toast until golden, then remove to a bowl., Place the pan back on the heat, drizzle in 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil, then add 1 x 225g salmon fillet, skin-side down. Fry for around 6 minutes, or until the skin is golden and crisp. Flip over and cook for roughly 5 more minutes, or until just cooked through in the middle – this will vary slightly depending on the thickness of your salmon, so use your instincts. Remove the salmon to a board, skin-side up, and leave to cool a little., Pop the frying pan back on a medium heat. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil, add the garlic, chilli, ginger and coriander stalks, then fry for a couple of minutes, or until lightly golden., Add the cooked veg, and using a potato masher, lightly crush the potatoes. Toss everything together, season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, then fry for a couple of minutes. Remove from the heat., Trim and finely slice 2 spring onions, stir them through the potatoes with the coriander leaves, then spoon onto a serving platter., Flake over the cooked salmon and sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds. Serve with the pickled cucumber and cut the remaining lime wedges for squeezing over."

Place the remaining sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan with 100ml of water and bring it to the boil over a medium heat. Don’t stir it, just swirl it occasionally. Keep it boiling for about 10 minutes, or until you have a gorgeous golden caramel liquid., Now cook the fish. Place a clay pot or earthenware dish on a medium heat and add a splash of groundnut oil. Add the fish, reserving the marinade juices, and seal all the sides for 2 to 3 minutes altogether., Pour in the marinade, the caramel and the coconut water. Gently bring it to the boil, then let it simmer uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the sauce is reduced, golden and sticky. If it looks too dry halfway through, add a little more coconut water., Serve immediately – delicious with steamed jasmine rice and greens."

Bring a pan of salted water to the boil., Once the salmon is done, leave to cool a little before removing skin and breaking flesh into chunks., Boil the quail eggs for 2 minutes, or hen eggs for 5½ minutes. Cool in a bowl of cold water then peel carefully., Spoon a dollop of horseradish crème fraîche onto your plates, top with a few pieces of salmon and some watercress. Allocating 2 quail eggs or 1 hen egg per person, cut into halves or quarters and place around the salmon. Finish by picking over the dill and drizzling with extra virgin olive oil."

Combine with the yoghurt, and season to taste., Using a speed-peeler, peel the cucumber into ribbons and place in a bowl. Peel and finely slice the shallots and chilli, then add to the bowl. Sprinkle over the vinegar, sugar and a pinch of salt, and mix with your hands to combine the flavours., Place a tortilla on each plate and flake over the salmon fillets, including any crispy skin. Add a dollop of the herby yoghurt, the minty cucumber (squeezing out any liquid) and pick over the reserved coriander leaves. Roll up and enjoy."

Leave to cool while you tend to your mackerel., In a large bowl, combine the pomegranate molasses, honey and 40ml of satsuma or orange juice, then season. Place the mackerel into the mixture and leave to marinate for 20 minutes., Carry on with your salad. Peel the onion, pick off and reserve the fennel fronds, then very finely slice with a mandolin if you have one (use the guard!)., Peel and slice the satsumas into rounds, then combine with the red onion, fennel and beetroot. Set aside., For the vinaigrette, combine the oil, lemon juice, molasses and honey in a small bowl and whisk well. Set aside until ready to serve., Remove the mackerel fillets from the marinade and place on a baking tray lined with foil., Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to the boil over a high heat. Cook for 5 minutes, or until it’s reduced and thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Set aside for the glaze., Preheat your grill to full whack and grill the fillets for 4 minutes, or until the skin turns golden and charred and the flesh firms up. Remove from the oven and brush with the glaze, then season., Drizzle the vinaigrette over the salad and toss to combine. Roughly chop and add the dill and serve alongside the mackerel."

then chop the chillies, lemongrass and coriander, including the stalks., Place in a pestle and mortar or blender with the remaining paste ingredients and either pound or blitz till you’ve got a thick, aromatic paste., Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Peel the lime zest and add to the water with the rice, and wait for the grains to start dancing around. Boil for 5 minutes, then drain in a sieve., Pour 2.5cm of water into the pan, put it back on the heat, bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer. Cover the rice in the sieve with tin foil and place on top of the pan for 8 minutes, or until tender., Place another large pan over a medium heat. Add the sesame oil, then the spice paste, and fry for a minute or so to get the flavours going., Add the coconut milk, chicken stock and lime juice. Give it a stir, add the whole dried chillies, then bring to the boil and turn down to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes., Cut the monkfish into 1cm slices, then halve the scallops., Add the langoustines to the pan and cook for 3 minutes, then add your fish and scallops and cook for 3 more minutes. The fish won’t need long, so once it’s cooked through and the langoustines have turned bright red and their tails have curled up, take the stew off the heat., Add a few dashes of soy sauce to taste. Put some rice into each bowl, then ladle over that incredible stew, making sure everyone gets a langoustine and pieces of fish and scallops. Just watch out for those dried chillies if you aren’t a chilli freak like me!"

Turn up the heat and allow the liquid to boil for 10 minutes, until it reduces a little., Warm a large serving bowl or tureen., Add the langoustines and cover with a lid for 3 minutes, then add the razor clams. Replace the lid and cook for a further 2 minutes., Add the mussels and clams. Give it all a gentle stir, add another good splash of cider and replace the lid.

Stir well to combine, and pour the sauce over the shellfish in the bowl. Serve immediately – delicious with crusty bread."

a pestle and mortar with the cumin, fennel seeds and a good pinch of sea salt to make a paste., Stir in the chilli flakes, paprika and the juice from 1 lime, then loosen with a good drizzle of olive oil., With a sharp knife, score the skin of the herring at 1cm intervals, being careful not to cut into the flesh. Spoon the rub over the fish and gently push into the slits. Place the fillets on a baking tray, skin-side up, and set aside., For the guacamole, halve and destone the avocados and scoop the flesh into a mortar, reserving the skins. Don’t bother washing the pestle and mortar first – the flavours from the rub will only make the guacamole taste better., Squeeze in the lime juice, pick, roughly chop and add the coriander leaves, then smash it all together. Season, then spoon back into the avocado skins and chill until ready to serve., For the salsa, roughly chop the tomatoes, coriander leaves and chilli on a board, mixing them together as you go. Add a tiny pinch of salt and black pepper and a splash of extra virgin olive oil. Keep running your knife through it until all the flavours are mixed together., Heat your griddle pan over a high heat so it’s screaming hot., Mix the yoghurt and juice of 1 lime together. Line up your taco shells, fillings and greens so you’re ready for the fish., When the pan is hot, pop on the fillets for a couple of minutes, or until the skin is beautifully crisp and the flesh cooked through. Serve up with the gem lettuce and some mixed cress, if you like, and let everyone dig in!"

They go to work pickling and preserving their herring in November, because by this time the fish have finished spawning and the texture of their flesh is dense and delicious again.

I'm so glad I became reacquainted with the joys of herring during my visit because I discovered really creative, mind-blowing flavours for pickling: everything from dill to red onion, cloves and even a curried mayo! ”",255,16.4g,4.7g,11.1g,1.7g,15g,11.6g,0.5g,"4                                                                                                                                                                large (about 80g each)                                                                                                                                                                or 8 small pickled herrings                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources, 1 x 150                                                                                                                                                                ml tub of                                                                                                                                                                soured cream, 1                                                                                                                                                                 bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh chives (30g), 1                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                red onion                                                                                                                                                                , peeled and very finely chopped, fish roe                                                                                                                                                                , optional, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, dill flowers                                                                                                                                                                , optional","Lay 1 or 2 herrings in the middle of each plate and spoon a few dollops of soured cream over each one., Finely chop and top with a big handful of chives.

To make the spice cure, zest the orange, trim the chilli and peel the shallot. Blitz the orange zest, allspice, cinnamon, chilli, treacle and shallot in a food processor until you have a smooth paste., Transfer this to a bowl and stir in the rock salt and sugar. Pour in the 2 tablespoons of rum and mix well., Lay a large double layer of greaseproof paper over a baking tray and place the salmon on it, skin-side down. Slowly pour over the spice cure and use a spatula to spread it all over the salmon., Wrap the fish in both layers of the paper, then tightly in clingfilm. Place in the fridge with something heavy on top to weigh it down, then leave for 48 hours., When the time is up, take the salmon out of the fridge and carefully unwrap it. Rinse off the cure with the 50ml of rum (or you can use cold water), holding the salmon over a baking tray and pouring over a splash at a time. Use a spoon to gently push the cure off the fish. It should have shared its wonderful flavours with the salmon and turned it a dark brownish pink., For the herb cure, pick and finely chop all the herbs and mix together in a bowl., Clean the baking tray and cover with two layers of paper as before, then place the salmon on it, skin-side down. Using your hands, pack the herby cure onto the fish, covering all of the flesh – you don’t want air getting in., As before, wrap it with the two layers of greaseproof paper, then a tight layer of clingfilm. Pop it back in the fridge with weights on top and leave for another 24 hours., The next day, your salmon will be perfectly cured and ready to eat. You don’t need to rinse off that second cure – simply slice the salmon diagonally, as thinly as you like, then serve with pickled carrots, chillies, and buttered slices of bread."

Cover with cold water and bring to the boil over 
a medium heat. Lower the heat, cover and simmer for 40 minutes, until tender (skip this step if using tinned beans, as they’re already cooked.), Preheat the oven to 220ºC/gas 7., Drain the beans in a colander, tip into a bowl and cover. Place the red peppers on a baking tray and roast for 30 minutes, or until tender and the skins have blackened., Remove from the oven and place in a sealable bag. Shake for a bit, then leave for 5 minutes or until the bag is filled with steam. Tip the peppers onto a wooden board and remove the skins and seeds with your fingers or a knife. Roughly chop the peppers and place in a bowl; set aside. Lower the oven to 200ºC/gas 6., Peel and finely chop the garlic cloves, pick and finely chop the parsley and roughly chop the kale., Using a pestle and mortar, pound the breadcrumbs, garlic, parsley and half of the paprika for a few minutes. Transfer to a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of oil and season generously., Arrange the jamón slices on a large wooden board so that they overlap, then place your cod in the middle., Spoon the breadcrumb mixture along the length of the cod on each side, then fold the meat slices over the top, creating a log-shaped parcel. Tie up tightly with string, tucking a bay leaf under each knot., Transfer to a lightly oiled baking tin and drizzle with a little olive oil. Roast for 30 minutes, or until the cod is cooked and the jamón is crisping up., Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the borlotti beans, peppers and kale. Season and add the rest of the paprika. Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 12 to 15 minutes, then transfer to a platter., Place the cod parcel on top and serve immediately, cutting the cod into thick slices with a sharp knife."

Peel and finely slice the onion, deseed and finely chop the chilli, and peel and finely chop the garlic., Heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and sauté the onion, chilli, garlic and oregano until softened – about 5 minutes., Season and add the tinned tomatoes, tomato paste and 200ml of water. Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 40 minutes, or until thickened. Transfer the sauce to a bowl until ready to use., For the pastry, combine the flour and a pinch of sea salt in a food processor. Dice and add the butter, then blitz until it resembles breadcrumbs. Beat and add the eggs with about 60ml of cold water to form a dough. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., Roll out the dough 5mm thick and cut out the pastry in circles large enough to line eight 12cm tart tins (or 14 to 16cm x 10cm tins). Lay the pastry in the tins, pushing it down gently, then trim away any excess., Line each tin with baking paper, then fill with baking beans or uncooked rice and bake for 15 to 20 minutes., Remove the paper and beans or rice, then return the tins to the oven and cook for a further 6 to 8 minutes, or until the pastry is golden., Meanwhile, make the kedgeree. Peel and finely grate the ginger, peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then coarsely grate the tomatoes., Place the haddock and bay leaves in a large pan and cover with the milk. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, lower the temperature and simmer for 10 minutes, until cooked. Allow the fish to cool slightly, then transfer it to a bowl and flake into chunks., Cook the rice in salted water for about 15 minutes, then drain and add to the bowl with the haddock., Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, curry and mustard powders and sauté for 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the grated tomatoes, season well and cook for 10 to 12 minutes., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/gas 6., Add the fish, rice, lemon zest and juice to the onion mixture, stir well and cook for a few more minutes. Transfer back to the bowl and allow to cool for 5 minutes., Divide the kedgeree between your tart tins, making a small well in the middle of each one. Crack an egg into every well, place the tins on a baking tray and pop in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking., Meanwhile, make the chilli glaze by deseeding and finely chopping the chillies, and combining it with the oil in a small saucepan and cooking over a medium heat for 10 minutes., Divide the kedgeree tarts between plates. Brush the top of each tart with chilli glaze, pick over the coriander leaves and serve with the tomato and chilli sauce on the side."

Drain in a colander and cut into 2cm slices., Trim and finely slice the spring onions, pick and finely chop the herbs and roughly shred the trout., Heat the oil and butter in a frying pan over a medium heat and sauté the spring onions for 2 to 3 minutes, until softened. Season generously with sea salt and black pepper., Add the potatoes to the pan and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally, until starting to turn golden and slightly crisp., Make the horseradish dressing: place all the ingredients in a bowl and stir to combine., Add the smoked trout to the pan, stir into the potato mixture, and continue to cook for 5 minutes., Scatter the chopped herbs over the hash before serving with the creamy horseradish dressing. Cut the lemon into wedges for squeezing over."

and finely slice with the chilli, then peel and matchstick the ginger., Put a 25cm shallow casserole pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, the spring onions, chilli, ginger, curry leaves and all the spices. Stir and fry for 5 minutes, or until lightly golden., Meanwhile, remove the prawn heads and stir them into the pan as you go for serious added flavour, then add the rice and 1.2 litres of boiling water., Simmer for 10 minutes while you peel the rest of the prawns (I leave the tails on), then use a small sharp knife to lightly score down the backs and devein them, which will mean they butterfly as they cook. Keep in the fridge until needed., Halve and add the tomatoes to the pan, then cover with the coconut milk. Simmer for 20 minutes, then cut the fish in half across the middle and place in the pan for a further 10 minutes, or until the fish and rice are cooked through, adding the prawns for the last 5 minutes., Pick out the prawn heads, squeeze out all the lovely juices, then discard, and loosen the stew with a little boiling water, if needed. 
Have a taste, and season to perfection with sea salt, black pepper and lemon juice., One-by-one, puff up your dry poppadoms in the microwave for around 30 seconds each and serve with the stew."

Roll them in the polenta, place on a lined tray and pop in the fridge for at least 30 minutes., Place a large, ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat, add a little oil and fry the fish cakes until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes each side (you might need to do this in batches). Return to the oven for 10 minutes., In a bowl, mix the zest and juice of ½ a lime with the chilli sauce and yoghurt. Season and scatter over some coriander. Serve with the fish cakes, a crisp salad and the remaining lime cut into wedges."

Drain and mash together, reserving a splash of the poaching milk., Remove the amount needed for your baby, adding some of the reserved milk to loosen to the desired consistency., For adults and toddlers, crack 1 egg into the remaining mash, and finely grate in the lemon zest. Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, and stir well to combine, then leave in the fridge to cool completely., Meanwhile, whisk the remaining egg and a pinch of sea salt in a shallow bowl. Place the oats or Ryvita crackers into a blender and whiz until fine, then tip into another shallow bowl., Scoop out 1 tablespoon of the fishcake mixture and shape into a small patty. Dip the patty into the egg, letting any excess egg drip off, then cover in the breadcrumbs., Place onto a lined baking tray, and repeat with the remaining ingredients – you should end up with around 12 patties., Drizzle with a little oil then bake in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden, turning halfway, then leave to cool slightly. Delicious served with seasonal greens, or a fresh green salad."

Put the flour in a shallow bowl with the paprika and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then grate in the lemon zest. Beat the eggs in another shallow bowl. Blitz the bread in a food processor to fine breadcrumbs, then tip onto a plate., Once defrosted, slice the fillets lengthways into fingers, roughly 2cm wide, then add to the flour and toss to coat (you’ll need to do this in batches). Dip the flour-dusted fish pieces into the egg, shake off the excess, then roll in the breadcrumbs until well coated and place on a tray., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Add the fish fingers (you’ll need to do this in batches) and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden, crispy and cooked through. Remove to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain while you fry the next batch, adding a splash more oil, if needed., Meanwhile, blitz the peas in a food processor until they’re smashed up to a nice, chunky purée, or mash well with a fork. Tip into a bowl, then finely chop and pick in the mint leaves, squeeze in the lemon juice and season to how you like it. Mix well and serve alongside the crispy fish fingers and a nice green salad. If you want a dollop of ketchup, too, I won’t judge!"

Combine the prawns, tarragon and olive oil in a small bowl and season generously. For the egg wash, whisk the egg and milk in a small bowl and set aside., Lightly flour a work surface and roll out half of the pastry to a rectangular shape about 5mm thick and 10cm longer than the fish fillets (for the head and tail). Transfer to a lightly oiled baking tin., Place one of the fillets, skin-side down, on the pastry, leaving a little more space at one end for the tail shape. Spoon the prawn and tarragon mixture over the fish and place the other fillet on top. Brush the edges of the pastry with the egg wash., Roll out the remaining pastry to the same size and use this to cover the fish, pressing the edges carefully to seal them. Use a small, sharp knife to trim the excess and create your fish shape. Then, with a teaspoon, score half-moon shapes into the pastry in the style of fish scales (but don’t pierce the pastry)., Roll the off-cut pastry to 1cm thick, cut out a few thin strips to shape into fins, and tear off a small piece and roll into a ball for the fish’s eye. Build your fish shape, brush with the remaining egg wash, then bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 220ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and cook for another 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the fish is cooked., Meanwhile, make the salsa verde. Roughly chop the herb leaves in the centre of a large chopping board. Add the garlic, cornichons, capers and anchovies and continue chopping until fine, mixing it together as you go. Transfer to a bowl, stir in the olive oil and vinegar, and season well., To serve, transfer the fish to a platter and serve in slices with the salsa verde and salad."

Leave to soak for at least 12 hours, draining and covering with fresh water every few hours., When you’re ready to cook, finely slice the parsley stalks (reserving the leaves). Peel the shallots and finely slice into rounds. Using a speed-peeler, peel away strips of lemon zest., Place a large pan on a high heat, half fill with water and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Drain and add the salt cod, then the parsley stalks, shallots and lemon peel. Poach for around 20 minutes, or until the cod starts to soften and flake apart., Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the onions, then place in a large, wide pan on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season with black pepper and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden and starting to caramelize, stirring regularly., Destone the olives and tear the flesh into a bowl. Roughly chop the parsley leaves, and add half to the bowl with the chilli flakes, vinegar and 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Mix well and set aside., Use a slotted spoon to remove the salt cod to a plate. Pick out any bones, then break the flesh into the onion pan, also adding a good splash of poaching liquid. Cook for a further 10 minutes on a low heat, or until the fish is soft and flaking apart, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat off., Meanwhile, peel the potatoes, then finely slice into matchsticks using a mandolin (use the guard!) or a sharp knife. Just under half fill a sturdy pan with the vegetable oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat., Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go., Working in batches, use a slotted spoon to carefully lower the potato matchsticks into the hot oil to cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until very lightly golden, but not cooked through. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain and repeat., Return the cod mixture to a medium heat, then stir in most of the remaining chopped parsley. Beat the eggs, then gently stir them into the pan. Fold in three-quarters of the potato matchsticks and take the pan off the heat – the eggs will continue to cook in the pan, so make sure you don’t overcook them at this stage., Return the remaining potato matchsticks to the hot oil to fry for a further 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain, and season with sea salt., Transfer the bacalhau to a serving dish and top with the crispy potato fries. Using a slotted spoon, spoon over the marinated olives, then sprinkle the remaining chopped parsley on top. Great served with a green salad and a cold glass of dry white wine."

Transfer to a bowl, cover with cling film and leave to cool for around 10 minutes., Meanwhile, using a long sharp knife, slice off and discard the veiny stub of meat from the tuna, then thinly slice against the grain. Place on a plate and squeeze over the juice from half the lemon – the acidity will start to cook the fish., Pick and finely chop the basil, finely chop the dill fronds, then peel and finely chop the garlic. Drain and finely chop the capers, then add the chopped ingredients to a bowl with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Scrape off and discard the blackened skin from the cooled chilli. Halve, deseed and finely chop most of it, then add the chopped chilli to the bowl, reserving the rest to one side.

Place the sesame seeds onto a tray, then add the tuna chunks, turning them over in the seeds so they’re nicely coated., Heat a good drizzle of olive and sesame oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. Peel and thinly slice the garlic, then add most of it to the pan. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden and crisp, then use a slotted spoon to transfer to a plate (don’t drain away the oil!)., Return the pan to the heat and allow to heat up again, then add the sesame-coated tuna to the garlicky oil. Sear on one side for 10 to 20 seconds. Using tongs, turn the tuna over and keep cooking until you’ve seared only four sides of each chunk. Transfer to a plate., Peel and finely grate the ginger, then add to a bowl with the soy, 1 teaspoon sesame oil and the remaining sliced garlic. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, then mix well to combine. Have a taste and add a squeeze more lemon juice, if needed., Cut the seared tuna into slices, roughly 1cm thick, then arrange on your plates. Drizzle over the Asian dressing, scatter the garlic chips on top and tear over the coriander leaves. Trim and finely slice the spring onion and chilli at an angle, scatter on top, then finish with a drizzle of olive oil."

Place the oil and butter in a pan to melt. Meanwhile, finely chop the garlic and chilli (keep the seeds in if you like the heat), then add to the pan with the black pepper. Give it a good stir, let all the ingredients party, then set aside., Place the shells with the scallops inside them on a platter, then add a dash of white wine to each one. Using tongs, place each shell directly on the grey coals, carefully positioning them so they can’t tip over. Cover with the lid like an outdoor oven and cook for 4 to 6 minutes, or until cooked through, turning the scallops halfway with tongs. Carefully remove the shells to a serving platter and drizzle about 1 tablespoon of the melted chilli garlic butter over each golden scallop. Roughly chop and scatter over the parsley leaves then serve right away., Tip:  ￼Ask your fishmonger to prep and clean the scallops for you. You’ll be cooking them in their shells, so make sure you ask for these too."

pound the allspice berries, peppercorns and bay leaves in a pestle and mortar until fine. Mix in the cloves, sugar and honey., Pick and chop the thyme leaves and chop the coriander leaves. Peel and finely chop the ginger and garlic, and finely chop the chillies., Add the chopped herbs, chillies, garlic and ginger to the marinade and bash it all together, then tip into a jug., Finely slice the spring onions and add the chopped green tops to the jug. Grate in the lime zest and add a drizzle of oil, a pinch of salt and the rum, if using. Mix well., Pour the marinade over the fish and massage it in. (It’s a good idea to wear rubber gloves for this!) Leave in the fridge to marinate for at least 1 hour., Meanwhile, prepare the salsa. Heat a griddle pan until searing hot, and cook the corn cobs for 5 to 10 minutes, turning every minute or two until the corn is evenly charred. Set them aside until they’re cool enough to handle., Peel and chop the mango, finely slice the spring onions and add both to a serving bowl with the reserved white spring onion slices. Chop the coriander and tomatoes, and add to the bowl., Carefully remove the corn kernels from the husk with a sharp knife and add to the serving bowl with the mango. Season to taste, grate in the lime zest and squeeze in the juice. Drizzle in a little olive oil, then toss to combine., Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Place the fish in the pre-heated oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until slightly charred and cooked. Serve each fish whole with the salsa on the side, and lime wedges for squeezing over."

Bring to the boil, then cook over a medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender., Drain and steam dry, then mash the potatoes until really smooth (use a potato ricer if you have one). Season well and mash in the butter., For the guacamole-style dressing, halve and destone the avocados, then scrape the flesh into a medium bowl. Season with sea salt and black pepper and squeeze over the lime juice., Peel and grate in the onion along with the tomato, then mash together to a chunky guacamole. Chop the coriander and add it to the guacamole with plenty of extra virgin olive oil, then leave to one side., Peel and finely chop the onion, then place into a small bowl with the lime zest and juice. Toss together and leave to one side for 5 to 10 minutes., Finely chop the prawns and mix together with the crabmeat and aji amarillo paste, seasoning well. Mix in the onions, leaving behind the excess juice., Line up 3 bowls – one with flour, one with beaten eggs and one with breadcrumbs., Place a scoop of mashed potato in your hand and roll into a ball (roughly 4cm in diameter). Press a hole in the middle with your thumb, about 2cm deep, and spoon in some prawn and crab mixture., Close the hole as gently as you can to conceal the filling, then repeat until you’ve used up all the mash and filling – you should end up with around 15 croquettes., Roll each croquette in the flour, dip it into the egg (letting the excess drip off), then coat in breadcrumbs., Pour the vegetable oil into a large pan and gently heat to 180°C (a cube of bread dropped into the oil will turn brown within 1 minute)., Gently lower the croquettes into the oil with a slotted spoon and fry for around 4 minutes, or until golden and crisp – you’ll need to do this in batches., Drain the cooked croquettes on kitchen paper, then serve hot on a plate smeared with the guacamole."

half into wedges for serving later, then squeeze the juice of the other half on to a large plate and add 1 tablespoon of tikka paste., Mix together, then massage all over the frozen fish and leave aside in a single layer to marinate and defrost., Peel and slice the onion, garlic and ginger with the chilli and coriander stalks, then place it all in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with a lug of oil and the remaining tikka paste., Peel the potatoes, cut them into 2cm chunks, then stir them into the pan and cook everything for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally. This will build up great flavour., Quarter the tomatoes, add to the pan with the cauliflower, lentils and 600ml of boiling water, and bring back to the boil. Simmer for 45 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through and the sauce is lovely and thick, adding splashes of water, if needed, then season to perfection., Around 15 minutes before the curry is ready, put 1 mug (320g) of rice and 2 mugs of boiling water into a pan with a pinch of sea salt and the cloves. Cook on a medium heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed., Dry-fry the fish in a large non-stick pan for 3 to 5 minutes per side (depending on the thickness), or until charred, gnarly and cooked through – don’t be tempted to move it around, just let it colour and crisp up nicely., Stir half the yoghurt through the curry and dollop the remaining yoghurt on top. Fluff up the rice, flake the fish on top, then sprinkle with coriander leaves and serve alongside the curry, with lemon wedges for squeezing over."

lemon and the fennel into rounds and stuff into the salmon cavity with the parsley, marjoram and chives., Combine the rock salt, eggs and 250ml of water in a large bowl, then evenly spread one-third of the mixture over a large baking tray (35cm x 45cm)., Make a slight hollow in the middle to hold the salmon snugly, lay the salmon diagonally in the tray, then spoon over the remaining salt mixture, heaping it around and on to the salmon to create an even 2cm-thick layer all over the fish. Bake for 35 minutes., To test if the salmon is ready, push a skewer through the salt into the thickest part of the fish – if it comes out warm after 5 seconds, it’s done. Remove from the oven and set aside in the crust for just 1 hour., Meanwhile, make the basil yoghurt. Pick the basil leaves into a blender and add the mustard, the juice of 1 lemon and half the yoghurt. Blitz until smooth, then fold back through the rest of the yoghurt with 4 tablespoons of oil, and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., To make the salsa, deseed the chillies and very finely chop with the mint leaves and a drizzle of honey. Scrape into a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of oil and 2 teaspoons of vinegar, and season to perfection., Lightly crack the salt casing and pull it away from the salmon, brushing any excess from the top. Gently loosen and carefully transfer the fish to a large platter., Pull the skin away, then use a regular eating knife to scrape away any darker fish, leaving you with beautifully cooked pink salmon, which you can rustically remove in flakes and lobes., Serve with the basil yoghurt, salsa and lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Pick the dill leaves and reserve in a bowl of cold water in the fridge, then finely chop the stalks and stir into the mixture so well combined. Pop the salmon fillets into the bowl, turning them over in the marinade until well coated, then cover with cling film and place in the fridge for 5 hours., Meanwhile, make the horseradish sauce. Add the soured cream, grated horseradish and the juice from ½ a lemon to a small bowl. Mix well, season with a pinch of salt and add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, then place in the fridge until needed., Add the beetroot (including the juices) to a bowl with a splash of balsamic vinegar. Season well with salt, then mash with a fork to a rough paste. Have a taste and add a splash more vinegar if you think it needs it, then set aside until needed., After around 5 hours, remove the salmon from the bowl, then wipe off and discard any excess salt. Drain and finely chop the reserved dill leaves and rub all over the salmon. If you’re not serving straight away, sandwich the salmon together, with the skin-side outside and wrap in cling film, then return to the fridge, until needed., To serve, remove the cling film and peel away the salmon skin, then transfer to a board and finely slice. Snip over the cress, then serve alongside the horseradish sauce, balsamic beets, rye bread and lemon wedges for squeezing over. I sometimes like to serve it with a shot of vodka on the side too. Enjoy!"

Pick the coriander leaves, finely chopping the stalks, and deseed and slice the peppers., Put your largest roasting tray on the hob over a medium heat, and drizzle in 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the spices and curry leaves and fry for 2 minutes, then add the chopped veg, garlic and coriander stalks. Cook for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Place the salmon into the tray, skin-side down. Season with sea salt and black pepper, and drizzle lightly with oil. After 1 minute, carefully turn the salmon skin-side up, then place the tray in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the salmon is almost cooked through., Quarter the tomatoes, and run the tip of a knife down the backs of the prawns and pull out the vein, meaning they'll butterfly as they cook., Remove the tray from the oven and preheat the grill to full whack. Carefully peel the skin off the salmon and place onto a piece of tin foil., Stir the tomatoes, prawns and coconut milk into the tray, then finely grate over the zest from 1 lemon and squeeze over the juice. Gently simmer on the hob over a medium-low heat until the prawns are just cooked through., Place the salmon skin under the grill for 5 minutes, or until lovely and crisp, then leave to cool., Break the salmon into big chunks. Season the sauce to taste with salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, then snap up and scatter over the crispy salmon skin., Sprinkle over the coriander leaves and serve with lots of lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Add the rice to one pan and cook for 2 minutes less than the cooking instructions., Add the eggs and bay leaves to the other pan and squeeze in the juice of half a lemon. Add the squeezed lemon half to the pan and leave to simmer for 7–8 minutes, adding the haddock halfway through., Meanwhile, get a large pan on a medium heat and add a drizzle of oil and the butter. Add the onion and fry for a few minutes, then add the coriander stalks and chilli and leave them to sweat. The slower you cook them, the sweeter they’ll be., When the rice is cooked, drain it, and put aside. After 3–4 minutes your haddock should be flaking apart; carefully pour most of the water away., Transfer the eggs to a colander and rinse them under the cold tap until they’re cool enough to peel. Discard the bay leaves and lemon half., Add the curry paste to the pan of onions and stir it through, fry for 5 more minutes then take the pan off the heat. Tip in your rice and stir it through – don’t totally mix, it’s nice to have a bit of a marbled effect., Roughly chop your peeled eggs into the pan, then flake over the haddock. Roughly chop most of the coriander leaves and add most of them to the pan with the juice from the remaining lemon. Gently fold it all together., Pop the pan on a low heat for 5 minutes to get nice and hot, then have a taste and adjust the seasoning. You shouldn’t need too much as the smoked fish gives it lots of flavour., Get a fork and fold it over a few times to keep it nice and light. When you hear a great sizzling, take it off the heat, scatter over the reserved coriander, pop in some lemon wedges and serve with yoghurt and sliced chilli, if desired., A pint of Guinness with a swig of port in it is fantastic with this – it might sound weird but it tastes great."

Add 2 teaspoons of harissa, followed by the zest and juice from ½ a lemon, then mix well, taste and add a little more lemon juice, if needed. Transfer to a bowl, drizzle over the rosewater and ripple through the remaining harissa. Set aside., Scrunch the oregano flowers into a liquidiser and discard the stalks, then add the fennel and a teaspoon each of salt and white pepper. Blitz to a fine powder, then place into a large bowl with the flour and stir to combine., Wash and pat dry the squid, then slice and open out the tubes like a book. Cut a criss-cross pattern onto the surface, then add to the flour along with the tentacles and toss well to coat., Place a large, deep saucepan over a medium-high heat. Fill three-quarters full with vegetable oil and allow to heat up. To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a piece of bread into the pan – if the bread floats to the surface, sizzles and turns golden, it's about right. Shake off any excess flour from the squid, then use a slotted spoon to carefully lower into the hot oil (you’ll need to do this in batches). Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden, crisp and cooked through. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain, then repeat with the remaining squid., Rinse the parsley sprigs under cold running water, shake off any excess water, then pick the leaves into the flour. Toss to coat, then lower into the hot oil for a few seconds, or until crisp. Transfer to kitchen paper, then slice 1 lemon horizontally into thin discs, dip into the flour and place in the hot oil for around 1 minute, or until crisp., Scatter the crispy parsley and lemon slices over the squid, then serve with extra lemon wedges for squeezing over and harissa mayo for dunking."

Pull the stringy bit and peel it down the length of the beans on both sides of each one, then slice at an angle into 5cm pieces., Trim the stalk-ends from the green and French beans, if using, but leave the wispy tips on, then slice the beans at an angle into 3cm pieces., Once boiling, carefully lower the potatoes into the water with a slotted spoon, bring back to the boil, then cook for around 10 to 12 minutes (depending on the size of your potatoes), or until they’re nearly done., Meanwhile, if your peas are still in their pods, pod them now., When the time’s up on the potatoes, carefully add all the beans to the pan and cook for a further 4 minutes., Drain the potatoes and beans over the sink into a colander and steam dry for a couple of minutes, then tip into a 25cm x 35cm roasting tray., Scatter over the peas, dot over the butter and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil., Use a microplane to finely grate the zest of both lemons onto a chopping board, then scatter into the tray., Cut the lemons in half. Squeeze the juice over the salmon and vegetables, using your fingers to catch any pips., Season lightly with salt and black pepper, then toss together while still warm so that the flavours are absorbed., Pick the basil leaves, discarding the stalks, then roughly chop them with the fennel tops or dill. Scatter half the herbs into the tray., Carefully score the salmon fillets lightly on the skin side. Rub each fillet with a little salt, pepper and olive oil, stuff the scores with the remaining herbs and place on top of the potatoes and beans, then wash your hands., Bake in the hot oven for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the exact size and thickness of your fillets, or until the salmon is cooked through and the vegetables are soft., Divide between your plates using a fish slice, then drizzle with the cooking juices from the bottom of the tray and serve."

The way I heard it, this brilliant rub was invented by an African-American chef working at Commander’s Palace, a posh New Orleans restaurant. The famous head chef there, Paul Prudhomme, took this recipe, added his own little tweaks and introduced blackened fish to the rest of the world. Basically it’s a bold rub that fragrantly flavours fish and meat and goes dark when it cooks, thanks to the paprika and garlic., Traditionally this dish has been made with the locally caught redfish, but it’s also great with any whole or filleted white fish. It goes with so many things, including chicken, pork, lamb and steak. When I was in Louisiana I cooked it on a barbecue, but I’ve shown you below how to do it indoors in a pan. Don’t be scared by how black the spices go: they’ll look burnt but the taste will be amazing., To make the rub, bash up your fresh herbs and garlic in a pestle and mortar until you've got a nice coarse paste. Mix in the spices, 1 teaspoon of sea salt, 1 level tablespoon of black pepper and the olive oil, then squeeze in the juice of half the lemon, making sure not to let any pips get in there, and stir well., Lightly score the skin of your fish in lines about 2cm apart. Using your fingers, smear the rub all over both sides of the fish and into the cuts you've made. Put a non-stick pan or griddle pan over a medium-high heat and let it get nice and hot. Place your fish in the pan, skin side down, and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes. It will get quite smoky, so you might want to open a window! Turn the heat down to low, then, very carefully, flip your fish over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side., Cut your remaining lemon half and your second lemon into wedges for squeezing over. Serve them with your fish, a nice salad and boiled or steamed new potatoes dressed in good olive oil or butter. Don’t forget a nice cold glass of wine!"

Peel and finely chop the ginger, then pick the coriander leaves and finely slice the stalks., Mix the spring onions, chilli, ginger, coriander stalks and most of the leaves together on a board, then stuff and push into the cavity and scores in the fish., Squeeze over the lime juice, adding the squeezed lime halves to the tray. Hit it up with a splash of soy sauce, then cover with the lid., Fill the steamer pocket on the front of the oven with around 1 litre of water, then slot the steamer tray into the bottom of the oven so that the metal nozzle on the tray engages with the back of the oven. Set to steam for around 25 minutes, or until cooked to perfection., Serve on a bed of fluffy rice, drizzled with the juices from the bottom of the steamer tray, a drizzle of sesame oil and the remaining coriander leaves sprinkled over."

Drain and mash well with a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, the zest from the lemon and the butter. Set aside., Peel and chop the carrots and onions, then fry them in a large ovenproof pan (roughly 30cm in diameter) with 1 tablespoon of oil over a medium heat for 15 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, heat the milk in a pan on a medium heat. Once simmering, add all the frozen fish fillets and cook for around 10 minutes, or until cooked through, then use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a plate, taking the pan off the heat., Stir the flour into the carrots and onions, then gradually add the warm milk, a ladleful at a time, stirring continuously until you have a smooth sauce. Stir in the spinach until thawed and incorporated, then season to perfection., Flake in the cooked fish fillets (carefully remove and discard any skin or bones), add the prawns and mustard, along with the juice of half the lemon, grate in the Cheddar, and stir gently to combine., Top with the pea-spiked mash and smooth out, scuffing it up slightly with a fork to give it texture that will crisp up. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until beautifully golden. Serve with a good old helping of baked beans (if you like). Delicious!"

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the chillies, garlic, a good pinch of salt and a good splash of vinegar, then cook over a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it coats the back of a spoon. For a smooth syrupy texture, whiz the sauce in a food processor if you like, or leave it finely chopped, then put to one side., Place a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep saucepan over a medium–high heat (roughly 180ºC). Fill three-quarters full with vegetable oil and leave to heat up., Meanwhile, wash and pat dry the squid. Slice the tubes horizontally into rings or slice and open them out, then halve lengthways and cut a crisscross pattern onto the surface. Place the squid onto a large plate, along with the prawns, making sure any black bits have been removed. Finely grate over the zest of the limes and squeeze over most of the juice, then toss to coat., Place the flour and a good pinch of salt and pepper into a large bowl, then add the squid and prawns and toss to coat (you’ll need to do this in batches)., To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a piece of bread into the pan – if the bread floats to the surface, sizzles and turns golden, it’s about right. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower the prawns and squid into the hot oil and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden and crisp on the outside and cooked through (you’ll need to do this in batches). Transfer the cooked prawns and squid to a double-layer of kitchen paper, then repeat with the remaining seafood., When the last batch of seafood is almost done, squeeze a little lime juice over the parsley sprigs, then dip into the flour and lower into the oil for a few seconds – be careful as it’ll spit., Serve the crispy squid and prawns straight away, with crispy lime-spiked parsley, lemon wedges for squeezing over and the sweet chilli sauce on the side for dipping. Keep any leftover chilli sauce in sterilised bottles and store for up to 2 months in a cool dry place."

Lay them over the base of the tray and season well with sea salt and black pepper. Cut the fennel into six wedges, scatter over the potatoes and give it all a generous drizzle of olive oil., Pick half the herb leaves onto a chopping board, .finely grate over the lemon zest, then roughly chop everything together. Scrape this mixture into a bowl., Using a sharp knife, make 6 slashes on each side of the fish, about 2cm deep and at an angle., Sprinkle salt and pepper into each incision,  stuff each with a pinch of the lemon-herb mix, then smooth flat. Drizzle the fish lightly with olive oil, then lay on top of the potatoes and fennel., Slice up one of the lemons, then stuff into the cavity with the remaining herbs., Bake the fish in the screaming hot oven for 15 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and cook for a further 30 minutes., To check if the fish is cooked, take a clean skewer and push it into the deepest part of the fish, just behind the head. Count to 10, then carefully take the skewer out and hold it against your top lip –if it’s nice and warm, the fish is cooked., Squeeze the juice from the remaining lemon over the top, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil.. Delicious served with a bowl of steamed seasonal greens."

It’s simple to serve and just as good cold as it is hot. If you’re not sure how to prepare the fish, get your fishmonger to do it for you. I’ve cooked it on a wooden plank in my outdoor wood-fired oven, but you can cook it in a large roasting tray in the oven., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Place the salmon fillets skin-side down in a large clean roasting tray – cut each in half if they don’t fit. Lay the rosemary on top and drizzle with olive oil. Gently rub the oil and rosemary all over the fish, and season. Bake for 20 minutes or until just cooked. (Alternatively, place on a clean smooth wooden plank and cook in an outdoor wood-fired oven for 20 minutes.), Meanwhile, mix the yoghurt and dill with the grated zest of the lemon, a few drops of juice and season. Cut portions of salmon off the skin and serve with the Italian farro salad."

Roasted fennel and potatoes are a magic combination, as are the fresh herbs and salmon. Scoring and stuffing the salmon is a great little trick you can use on any type of fish., Preheat your oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Halve the potatoes lengthways and trim the fennel bulb, reserving the leafy fronds for garnishing later. Cut the fennel bulb into eight wedges, add these to the salted water with the halved potatoes and parboil for around 6 minutes., Drain the vegetables in a colander and leave to steam-dry for a minute. Transfer to a large roasting tray and season well with salt and pepper. Sprinkle over half the chopped parsley and all of the garlic, dot over the butter and drizzle well with olive oil. Toss everything together in the roasting tray, then shake it out so it is in one even layer. Cook in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until golden., While the vegetables are roasting away in the oven, you can start preparing the salmon fillets. Pinch the fillets so they plump up and use the length of a knife to score the skin side of them. You want to score about 1cm down into them. Not only will this help all the lovely flavours get right into the fish, it will also help it cook more quickly. Season both sides of the fish well and stuff the remaining chopped parsley and the mint leaves into the scores. Mint goes brilliantly with oily fish, such as salmon., Once the potatoes are nice and golden, take them out of the oven and sprinkle the grated Parmesan over them. Give everything a bit of a jiggle, then lay the salmon, skin-side up, on top. Sprinkle the lemon zest over the top, drizzle with olive oil then cook for 15 minutes., Just before the salmon comes out of the oven, chop the reserved fennel fronds. Sprinkle them over the finished dish, then serve it in the middle of the table with some wedges of lemon and let everyone tuck in."

Fold three of the sides up like an envelope, sealing the edges by brushing them with a little beaten egg before folding. Leave one side open., Roughly chop or slice the potatoes, then cook in a pan of boiling salted water for 6 minutes. Drain and leave to cool slightly., Trim and chop the fennel into wedges, reserving the fronds, then finely slice the lemon. Halve the cherry tomatoes, then squash the olives and remove the stones., Place the fennel, lemon, tomatoes and olives into a large bowl with the cooled potatoes and fish. Drizzle lightly with oil, and season with sea salt and black pepper, then toss gently to coat., Carefully transfer everything to the foil bag, sprinkle in the fennel fronds, then loosely fold up the open side and pop the bag in the fridge until needed., When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Unravel the loose side of the bag, pour in the wine, then reseal and place on a baking tray., Cook for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the fish and potatoes are cooked through., To serve, place the bag on a serving plate and gently pierce to release the steam – the tomatoes and wine will have made a delicious sauce.

Zest and juice 2 of the lemons. In a food processor, whiz together the onion, garlic, all the parsley stalks and half the parsley leaves. When everything’s finely chopped, scoop into a bowl and add the couscous, 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and half of the lemon juice. Stir in the hot stock and season well. Stir again and leave to the side for a couple of minutes., The fish should pretty much all be prepared by your fishmonger. Make sure the sea bass fillets are halved and the skin of both the sea bass and the red mullet is slashed with a sharp knife. Chop a few of the parsley and mint leaves and stuff them into the slashes – this looks pretty, flavours the fish and helps to crisp up the skin. Place all the fish and shellfish into a bowl, drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil, season and mix together., Spoon the couscous into a roasting tray or ovenproof dish. Spread it out, then arrange the fish and shellfish over the top, in a single layer. Make sure the fillets are placed skin-side up. Drizzle over the remaining lemon juice, a little more olive oil and sprinkle with half of the lemon zest., Cut the remaining 2 lemons in half and put on top of the couscous. Place in the oven and roast for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the skin of the fillets is crispy around the edges., While your fish is cooking, make the salsa. Finely chop the remaining parsley and mint leaves and put into a bowl. Add the cinnamon and remaining lemon zest. Finely chop the plum tomatoes and roasted peppers and add to the herb mixture. Season, stir and set aside., Once the fish is cooked, you are ready to serve. Make sure everyone gets a portion of couscous and a bit of all the different fish, and spoon over some salsa and garnish with the roasted lemon."

The fish is simply cooked in one pan and the sauce practically makes itself., I usually serve it with mash, but some chunky potato wedges or buttered new potatoes and a fresh green salad would be great, too., Put the chopped potatoes in a pan, cover with cold water and add a good pinch of salt. Bring to the boil and cook for 15 minutes, or until cooked through and nice and soft for mashing., While the potatoes are cooking, halve or slice the sole fillets into 3 long strips. Get 2 plates, crack the egg onto one and beat it with a fork. Put the plain flour and a good pinch of salt and pepper on the other plate. Gently dip each of the little fingers of sole into the beaten egg, then the flour, making sure they are completely coated in each. Dust off any excess flour and put the pieces to one side. Keep going until all the sole is well coated., Warm up the milk in a small saucepan and, while you do that, drain the potatoes. Mash them and add the warmed milk, a teaspoon of the butter and a nice big pinch of salt and pepper. Cover the mash with a lid or some tin foil to keep it warm., Melt 15g of the butter in a small frying pan on a low heat, then add the spinach, a pinch of salt and pepper, and a good grating of nutmeg. Let the spinach wilt down for a few minutes while you cook the sole., Heat a large frying pan on a medium heat and add a little olive oil. Fry the sole pieces for a couple of minutes, until golden brown. Meanwhile, finely chop the parsley leaves. Turn the sole pieces over and add the remaining butter, the chopped parsley and the capers. As the sole pieces fry, the butter, capers and parsley will turn into a lovely sauce in the pan., Serve the sole fillets on a pile of mash with the wilted spinach, some wedges of lemon to squeeze over and a spoonful of that lovely buttery caper and parsley sauce. Delicious!"

wedges","This recipe may sound like a lot of work, but curing your own salmon is much easier than you think. You do need to plan ahead, as the flavours need about two days to sink into the salmon properly, but it’s worth the wait., You’ll only spend about 20 minutes doing the actual curing, and you’ll end up with a delicate pink gravadlax which tastes impressive. Although curing is easy, it is important to follow the measurements, so try to get a side of salmon as close as possible to the weight I’ve suggested here. 

For the first cure, blitz the beetroots, orange and lemon zest, and bashed juniper berries in a food processor until you get a fairly smooth paste. Transfer this to a bowl and stir in the rock salt and sugar. Pour in the gin and give it a good mix., Lay the side of salmon skin-side down on a large baking tray and slowly pour over the beetroot cure. Use a spatula to spread it all over the salmon flesh. Once it is all well covered, wrap the salmon in a double layer of greaseproof paper then wrap it tightly with cling film and place it in the fridge for 24 hours., The next day, take the salmon out of the fridge and carefully unwrap it so you can rinse off the cure. Either use 100ml of cold water or gin. Hold the salmon over a baking tray and pour a splash at a time over your salmon. Use a spoon to gently push the beetroot cure off the fish. By now it should have shared its wonderful flavours with the fish and turned it a really vibrant colour. Put the rinsed salmon to one side and run the tray under the tap., For the second cure, mix together the chopped herbs, grated horseradish and gin. Put the salmon back into the clean tray, skin-side down, and pack the herby cure onto the salmon using your hands. Make sure you cover all the flesh – you don’t want any air getting to it. Wrap it again with a double layer of greaseproof paper, then a tight layer of cling film. Pop the salmon back in the fridge for another 24 hours., The next day your salmon will be perfectly cured and ready to eat. You don’t need to rinse off that second cure – simply slice the salmon as finely as you can on an angle so you get gorgeous thin slices of gravadlax tinged with pink and topped with herbs. Pile these onto a plate and serve with a couple of slices of buttered brown bread, and some watercress and wedges of lemon."

Fry everything together for a minute then add the sliced chorizo. Cook for another few minutes until the sausage starts to brown, then pour in the white wine, tinned tomatoes, rice and chickpeas. Season well and simmer for 10 minutes, until the rice is just about cooked., Meanwhile, put a frying pan on a medium heat to make the pangrattato. Add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and let it heat up for a minute or so, then add the breadcrumbs, flat-leaf parsley and lemon zest. Fry for a couple of minutes until it’s all golden brown and crispy then put to one side., After the soup has simmered for 10 minutes, it should have thickened a little, so stir in about 200ml of hot water and bring everything to the boil. Cut each of the fish fillets into three pieces, then, carefully, so you don’t get splashed by any of the hot liquid, place them and the prawns into the mixture. Cook for a further 5 minutes until the fish is cooked through and the prawns are pink., When the fish is perfectly cooked, stir through the basil leaves. Ladle the soup into warm bowls and top each with a nice big spoonful of pangrattato. Serve with a few wedges of lemon to squeeze over the finished dish and enjoy all those gorgeous flavours!"

Meanwhile, cut the ciabatta in half lengthways, then cut into four equal-sized pieces, about 10–12cm/4–5 inches square., Place the sliced avocado in a bowl and squeeze over some lemon juice to stop it from discolouring. Using a speed peeler or potato peeler, slice the cucumber into long, thin strips on top of the avocado. Add the herbs and cress., Lightly toast the seeds in a dry pan on a medium to low heat, and place to one side to cool. Squeeze a tablespoon of juice out of the blood orange into a bowl, and add 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Season it well and give it a mix., Griddle your ciabatta squares in the griddle pan, charring both sides. Once they are nicely toasted, drizzle with a little of the dressing and put to one side. Place a square of ciabatta on each of four plates, then top each with a quarter of the smoked salmon., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the dressing over the salad and very gently mix with your fingertips. If you feel it needs more dressing, add a little extra, but try not to go overboard – you want it to be very light. Top the smoked salmon with the salad. Finish your delicious starter with a sprinkling of toasted seeds, using half a tablespoon per plate, and garnish with a wedge of blood orange."

Place the salmon onto a baking tray and sprinkle with salt and pepper then drizzle with a little olive oil and place in the hot oven for 8 to 10 minutes., While the salmon is in the oven, make the Marie Rose dressing. Mix the yoghurt and ketchup in a small bowl then add the zest and juice of one of the lemons. Season well with salt and pepper and add a dash of Tabasco for a bit of a kick. You want a loose, dressing-like consistency so you’re able to drizzle it over your salad. Taste and check it's to your liking. You can add more lemon and Tabasco if it needs a bit more flavour., After 8 to 10 minutes in the oven, the salmon should be just cooked, but still slightly pink and blushing in the middle. Take it out of the oven and put to one side to cool slightly. Meanwhile, get a large serving plate or platter. Roughly shred the little gems and mix together with the watercress, dress with a little extra virgin olive oil and scatter over the platter., Break the blushing salmon into nice big chunks and place them in and around the salad. Scatter over the cooked prawns, then spoon the Marie Rose dressing over everything. You can finish off the dish off by snipping over the salad cress. If you want to go for the old-school look, sprinkle a little paprika over the top. Serve with the remaining lemon (cut into wedges) and a glass of lovely cold white wine. Perfect!"

butternut squash into the soup is a little trick I saw in Sicily. It gives it good colour and sweetness., Finely chop the onion, celery, fennel, garlic and chilli. Heat the oil in a large pan, add the onion, celery, fennel, garlic and chilli and sweat gently until soft. Add the wine, tomatoes or passata, squash and stock and bring to the boil. Cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes. Season and gently break up the tomatoes., Roughly chop the salmon and halibut and add to the pan. Add the prawns or langoustine tails, cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until just cooked., Taste the soup and season it again with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, if necessary., Serve drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with the chopped parsley."

Put the fish in a food processor, breaking it up slightly as you go. Add the cream cheese, the zest and most of the juice of 1 lemon and a few leaves of parsley. Whiz for 20 seconds or so, or until you get a nice creamy pâté. Season to taste., Toss the snipped cress, remaining parsley leaves and celery leaves together in a large bowl, and add the celery sticks. Dress with a good squeeze of lemon juice, a splash of extra virgin olive oil and some salt and pepper., Heat a griddle pan. When hot, add the bread, in batches, and press down with something heavy like a frying pan so the bread is squashed against the griddle ridges. Toast for about 1 minute, turning halfway., Cut the remaining lemon into wedges and serve alongside the pâté with the griddled toast, the herb salad and a nice glass of chilled white."

Get your fishmonger to pinbone the fish if you don’t know how to. The roast trout looks fancy but there’s nothing difficult about it. In fact, if you can tie up a parcel you can make it., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Season the trout with salt and pepper and dust in the ground almonds. Lay 4 of the fillets on a board, skin-side down., Chop the apricots and half of the sage together. Mix and lay in a line along the tops of the 4 fillets. Top with the remaining fillets, skin-side up, matching heads and tails with the 4 below. Overlap the remaining sage along the length of each trout sandwich., Cut 4 x 20cm lengths of string and lay them parallel to each other on a work surface, leaving about 3–4cm between each one. Lay 1 of your trout sandwiches across the lengths of string and tie them all up. You should end up with a neat parcel tied in 4 places. Repeat with the other 3., Heat a large saucepan. Add a large splash of oil and gently fry the garlic until softened. Add the spinach and wilt down, seasoning with salt and pepper and the grated nutmeg. Spread the spinach out in a roasting tray and mix with the pulses. Put the trout parcels on top. Lay the prosciutto slices over the bean mixture, drizzle with oil and bake for 15–20 minutes until the prosciutto is crispy and the fish cooked through."

Leave it to marinate for an hour or so, either in a plastic bag or on a tray covered with clingfilm., Preheat your grill to its highest setting. When you’re ready to cook the salmon, remove it from the marinade, brush with the honey and grill for 10 minutes., Deseed the chillies and finely slice with the spring onions., Fork up the cooked salmon a little so everyone can see the lovely, dark, sticky outside and the juicy, pink fish underneath., Sprinkle the chillies and spring onions over the salmon with the reserved coriander leaves. Squeeze over the lime."

Make sure you get really fresh tuna – it needs to be red and almost waxy-looking., You can try using different fish, such as salmon, bream or scallops, just make sure they’re all really nice and fresh and smell of nothing but the sea., Get your tuna, and with a long sharp knife slice it as thinly as you can. Once you’ve sliced it, you can smooth it over with the side of your knife to make it even thinner. Divide this in one layer between your plates, or it’s even nicer to serve it on one big plate., Next, use this brilliant Japanese trick: cut a V-shaped vertical slit in the mooli and stuff the chilli in. This means that when you grate it you get a pink-coloured, chilli-flavoured radish pulp, which is fantastic. If you haven’t got mooli you can get the same effect by finely chopping the chilli and grating normal radishes., So, either grate or chop your mooli or radish and then blob it and its juice over the tuna slices and sprinkle over the shiso or coriander., When you serve it squeeze half a lime and a couple of teaspoons of soy sauce over each portion, to taste, then drizzle with a little olive oil., * Shiso is a Japanese herb with a strong flavour reminiscent of aniseed."

First of all give your fish a wash, then with a sharp knife score across each fish down to the bone at 2.5cm/1 inch intervals on both sides. This allows flavour to penetrate the fish and lets the fish’s juices come out., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Get yourself a bowl and add the tomatoes, garlic, oregano or basil, spring onions, balsamic vinegar, a pinch of salt and pepper and the zest and juice of 1 lemon to it. Loosen with a couple of good tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and mix well, then spread over the bottom of a large roasting tray. Use one that will fit all 4 fish quite snugly (or you can use two smaller trays). Place the fish on top – top to tail., Now add the olives, parsley, juice and zest of the second lemon to the bowl that the tomatoes were in. Loosen with a little olive oil and then divide this mixture between the fish, placing an equal amount on the centre of each. Cook in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the fish. To check whether they’re done, take the tip of a knife and push it into the thickest part of the fish. When done, the flesh will easily pull away from the bone., Once cooked, remove the fish from the oven and allow them to rest for 3 or 4 minutes while you get your guests round the table, serve them some wine and dress your salad. Then you can come back to the fish. Divide them up at the table on to 4 plates, making sure that everyone gets some tomatoes and juice spooned over the top of the fish. Lovely!"

recipe for these as they are something a little different. I’ve seen them made in Sicily in the same way, using a mixture of swordfish and tuna – not jarred or tinned tuna though. These have to be made with fresh fish and they are subtly seasoned with Sicilian herbs and spices – this recipe is just as good as the meat versions!, First make your sauce. Place a large pan on the heat, add a good lug of olive oil, your onion and garlic and fry slowly for 10 or so minutes until soft. Add your oregano, the tomatoes, salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Simmer for 15 minutes or so, then liquidize until smooth. Taste – it might need a tiny swig of red wine vinegar or some extra seasoning., While the tomatoes are simmering, chop the tuna up into 2.5cm/1 inch dice. Pour a good couple of tablespoons of olive oil into a large frying pan and place on the heat. Add the tuna to the pan with the pine nuts and cinnamon. Season lightly with salt and pepper and fry for a minute or so to cook the tuna on all sides and toast the pine nuts. Remove from the heat and put the mixture into a bowl. Allow to cool down for 5 minutes, then add the oregano, parsley, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, eggs, and zest and juice of the lemon to the bowl. Using your hands, really scrunch and mix the flavours into the tuna, then divide the mixture and squeeze it into meatballs slightly smaller than a golf ball. If you dip one of your hands in water while shaping you’ll get a nice smooth surface on the meatball. If the mixture’s very sticky, add a few more breadcrumbs. Keep the meatballs around the same size and place them on an oiled tray, then put them in the fridge for an hour to let them rest., Put the pan you fried the tuna in back on the heat with a little olive oil. Add your meatballs to the pan and jiggle them about until they’re golden brown all over. You might want to do them in batches – when they’re done, add them to the tomato sauce, divide between your plates, sprinkle with chopped parsley and drizzle with good olive oil. Great served with spaghetti or linguine."

Brush the burgers all over with a little oil and season lightly with sea salt and black pepper., Grill the burgers for 2 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking – the cooking time will depend on how thick you make them. It's OK to eat them when they're still a little pink inside, but if you want to cook them through, go ahead., Trim and separate the lettuce leaves, and slice the tomatoes into rounds., Halve the ciabatta rolls or burger buns, then toast the lightly on the barbecue or griddle., To assemble, place a hot tuna pattie into the toasted roll or bun, then layer up with some lettuce leaves, rocket and sliced tomato. Cut the zested lemon into wedges for squeezing over, then serve with ketchup or salsa verde."

They are so easy to make and damn tasty. Marinated in a blend of spices, they can be grilled, chargrilled or cooked on the barbie.

Stuff the cuts with the herb butter and fill the cavity of each fish with 2 slices of lemon and the cooked fennel., Gently transfer the fish to the inside of the foil bag or onto the foil. Add in the whole potatoes, capers, tomato sauce and white wine. Seal the foil bag at the end or, if you're using foil, fold it up like a parcel., Place the foil bags onto a baking tray and pop into the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through. Remove from the oven and allow to sit for 2-3 minutes, then place onto a serving plate, carefully open and enjoy with a crisp green salad or steamed vegetables."

In a food processor or liquidizer, whiz up the coriander stalks, half of the coriander leaves, the ginger, garlic, halved chillies, sesame oil, soy sauce, lime juice and zest and the coconut milk. This will give you a lovely fragrant Thai-style paste., Cook your rice in salted, boiling water until it’s just undercooked, then drain it in a colander. Scoop it into a high-sided roasting tray. Pour your Thai paste over the rice and mix it in well, then shake it out flat. Lay the sea bass fillets on top, scatter over the sugar snap peas or mangetouts, then cover the dish tightly with tinfoil and put it in the preheated oven for around 15 minutes.

on the middle shelf., Tear off a metre of kitchen foil. Fold it in half so it’s double thickness, then fold it in half again. You should end up with what looks like a big, foil birthday card. Make two of these then lay them opened and flat on your table. Each foil wrap will hold one piece of fish – you can do a big one for four or a slightly smaller version for two., In a pestle and mortar, bash your lime leaves until they break down and all the flavour comes out. Then add the lemon grass and do the same again. Do this for a couple of minutes... it’s worth every second. Then add the garlic, chilli, grated ginger and all of the coriander stalks. Once this is all smashed to a pulp, add the soy sauce, the lime zest and juice and the olive old. Mix well, then taste and correct the seasoning with extra soy sauce as you see fit., Lightly score the sea bass on the skin side with a sharp knife and then rub them with the lime-ginger-lemon grass mix. Allow to marinate for an hour, if you have time, or you can cook it all straight away., Lightly brush the foil edges with a little beaten egg white – this helps to seal the parcel when you fold it up and keeps all the flavoured steam inside to cook the fish., Put the portions of sea bass, skin-side up on one side of each envelope. Divide the marinade and all the juice between the two packages and tuck some coriander into the slits of each piece of fish. Fold over the foil, then fold up two sides of the envelopes securely. Just before you seal the final side of the foil bags, divide the sake between the two envelopes, taking care so that it doesn’t dribble out. Pucker and bend the folded sides up so that the juices can’t cook out. Don’t fold the foil right up to the edge of the fish – leave about 2 inches (5 cm) of space all round the fillets to let the steam circulate., I know all this sounds like a bit of a palaver, but it’s actually dead simple., Place straight on to the hot tray and cook for about 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Once cooked, allow to sit for 2–3 minutes. Serve the bags at the table – just cut them open and carefully lift out the fish. You can spoon the juices over it (but don’t eat the bits from the marinade as they’re really only there for flavour)., I like to serve this with a bowl of coriander-flavoured rice or noodles, cooked simply. You’re going to love it."

powder and turmeric. Cook for a few minutes and you'll get the most amazing smells filling the room from all these spices. Then add the chillies, the ginger, the garlic and the onions. Continue cooking slowly until the garlic and onions are soft. Then add the rice and the water. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Add your fish and the coconut milk with a little more water and a pinch of salt. Put the lid on the pan and simmer for a further 10 minutes, then stir well to break up the pieces of fish. Taste and correct the seasoning with salt and pepper, then just before you serve it squeeze in the lime juice and stir in half the coriander.

Peel and dice the potatoes., Place the haddock in a deep baking tray with the milk and bay leaves, then cover the tray with foil and cook for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in salted boiling water for about 15 minutes, until soft. Drain them in a colander to get rid of any excess water, then return to the pan on a low heat and mash., Flake the cooked fish into a large bowl, picking out any bones and removing the skin., Finely chop the parsley, mint and chilli, then bash the fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar., Add the mashed potato to the fish, along with the parsley, mint, chilli, fennel seeds, eggs and the zest of the lemons and limes. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix well, taste and add more salt if necessary., Flour your work surface, then take 1 tablespoon of the mix in your hands with a little flour and pat it into a flattened circle, rolling it in the flour. Rough and ready is good, so don’t worry about having them all exactly the same!, Pour enough oil into a large heavy-bottomed saucepan to fill the pan about a third of the way up. Heat over a medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted into the oil reaches 185°C/360°F. (If you don’t have a thermometer, heat the oil until a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.), Deep-fry the fishcakes for about 5 minutes until brown and crispy. Drain on kitchen paper, sprinkle with sea salt and serve on a large plate with lots of lemon halves."

You can make them up the day before, keep them in the fridge wrapped in cling film, then slice them up at the last minute. They look great if you serve them up-ended, like sushi-rolls, on a rectangular or square plate with the dip in a little bowl. You could use mustard mayo or even horseradish sauce instead of the vinaigrette dip if you like., Crack the eggs in a mixing bowl, then add the flour to the bowl so it sits in a pile to one side of the eggs. Gently start mixing the eggs with a whisk, then gradually whisk the flour in, little by little, until it’s all incorporated. If it gets a bit thick, add some of the milk to loosen it up. Once all the flour is mixed in, add the rest of the milk, 2 tablespoons of oil and a good pinch of salt. Leave for at least an hour before using., Heat a large non-stick frying pan and melt a knob of butter in it. Pour in a ladleful of batter, swirl the pan around, then pour any loose batter back into the bowl it came from. You should be left with a thin pancake stuck to the pan. Let it cook for a minute or so, flip it over for 30 seconds and then slide it out on to a plate. Repeat until all your batter is used. (It should make about five, so you could use the remainder for breakfast). Let the pancakes cool., Make a rectangle of double thickness cling film about 40cm x 15cm and lay two pancakes on it side by side, slightly overlapping. Spread them with a thin layer of crème fraîche, lay most of the chives on top, season well with pepper and place a layer of smoked salmon over the top. Use the cling film on one of the long sides of the rectangle to roll the pancakes up tightly like a Swiss roll. Re-wrap in cling film and leave for at least half an hour in the fridge to firm up before slicing into inch lengths and serving with a dip made from the rest of the oil, the lemon juice and salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the remaining chives before serving."

Do this by taking 4 x A5-sized pieces of foil or greaseproof paper, fold each one in half then fold up the 2 ends tightly, giving you an ‘envelope’. Preheat the oven to 250ºC/475ºF/gas 9. Boil your spuds until cooked, then drain and put to one side to cool. Slice them up roughly. Peel back the artichoke leaves, remove the chokes with a teaspoon, then rub the artichokes with lemon juice to stop them discolouring and slice very finely. Put the artichokes and potatoes in a bowl with the melted butter, thyme, parsley and capers and season well. Toss together and divide between the bags. There'll be a little butter left over in the bottom of the bowl, so you can add a little olive oil to it and use this to rub on to the skate pieces., Season the fish then place on top of the potatoes and artichokes. Add a glass of wine to each bag with a sprig of rosemary, tightly sealing the final side and pulling up the corners so that the liquid is contained. Bake on a roasting tray in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. By this time the bags will be beautifully puffed up. Serve at the table so that your guests can open their bags themselves, leaving a plate of really flavoursome vegetables, fish and juice. Serve with a dollop of crème fraîche, seasoned with a little salt and pepper, and a nice green salad."

Put your muffins in the toaster, ready for action. Melt half the butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat until bubbling, then tip the eggs in. Stir continuously with a wooden spoon, getting right into the edges. Cook until the runny egg starts to thicken., Turn the heat off when the eggs are still slightly undercooked – they will keep on cooking in the warm pan while you're toasting and buttering your muffins. Stir the rest of the butter into the eggs. Place the buttered muffin halves on individual plates and cover each one with a spoonful of scrambled egg. Drape a slice of salmon over each muffin half, dollop some soured cream on top and sprinkle with chopped chives and a twist of black pepper., Serve with your lemon wedges and a nice cup of tea – or a glass of something fizzy., Tip: To make things easier, toast your muffins first and keep them warm in the oven."

Wars and battles were won on salt cod because, of course, in the old days ships were sailing for weeks or months and the sailors would have a very unhealthy diet. Having salt cod on board as a source of protein kept them going, and it meant they could jump off the boat with enough energy for a bit of fighting when it was required! All kinds of cultures began to salt fish – I suppose Iberian and Nordic countries are particularly well known for still doing it today. And certainly the Italians are more than partial to their fair share of it. Hundreds of years ago the only way to get fish into the centre of Italy would have been to use preserved fish like salt cod. It might sound obvious, but this is why Tuscan cooking is predominantly meat- and bean-based. In the old days the only common fish recipes would have used either preserved or fresh lake fish., Unless you live in a country where it’s prevalent, like Portugal or Spain, salt cod can only be bought in good delis. Try to hunt out the real baccalà, but if you can’t find any then simply buy some fresh fish which can be salted overnight. As salt cod is preserved using copious amounts of salt, avoid seasoning this soup at all or do it right at the very end., If using fresh cod, haddock or monkfish, pack it in a few handfuls of sea salt overnight and rinse it before using. If using proper salt cod, soak the fillets in cold water for 24 hours, changing the water a few times during this period. This way, the fish will rehydrate and the saltiness will be removed before cooking. If the fish is more than 2cm thick it might need up to 36 hours’ soaking., Chop the onion, carrots, celery, garlic and parsley stalks. Heat a splash of olive oil in a saucepan, and add the chopped vegetables, parsley stalks and dried chilli. Sweat very slowly with the lid ajar for 15 to 20 minutes until soft, but not brown. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, then add the stock and bring back to the boil., Break up any larger pieces of tomato with a wooden spoon and drop the salt cod fillets into the hot soup. Simmer gently for 15 minutes, just until the fish has poached and flakes apart when prodded with a fork. Pick out any bits of skin. Gently fold the flakes of fish through the soup, taste and season with pepper, salt (if needed) and a little lemon juice. Chop the parsley and celery leaves and scatter over the soup. Drizzle with plenty of extra virgin olive oil."

We would catch them, then go straight back to his pub and grill them with a little bit of butter. I liked to eat them with fried potatoes with onions — so good — and a nice squeeze of lemon juice. I came up with this recipe using preserved artichoke hearts from my local deli. In the picture I’ve used one large 8lb trout, but it works just as well if you use individual trout fillets. Salmon trout or salmon are both good too. Ask your fishmonger to scale, gut and fillet the fish for you., Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7 and rub a roasting tray with a little olive oil. Lay 4 of the trout fillets, skin side down, on the tray, with a few bits of string under each fillet. Lightly toast the almonds in the oven for a couple of minutes – watch them carefully as they don’t take long – then bash them up using a pestle and mortar (or a metal bowl and a rolling pin). Try to get some powdery and some chunks. Put the almonds into a bowl and rip in the mint., Take the crusts off the ciabatta and whiz it up in a food processor or chop up. Add the lemon zest, chopped garlic, artichoke hearts, and 5 tablespoons of olive oil to the bowl with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Mix it up well and sprinkle a good handful of the mix over each trout fillet. Place the other 4 fillets on top of the breadcrumb mix, skin side up, laying a bacon rasher along the top of each one, and secure with the string. Sprinkle the thyme over the top and any excess filling around the tray., Place in the middle of the preheated oven and cook for about 15 minutes, until the trout is golden and crisp. Season the yoghurt generously with salt and pepper and add a little lemon juice., When the fish is ready, cut the string and serve the fillets with a nice drizzle of yoghurt and a green salad. Give everyone a lemon half on their plate so they can squeeze the juice over their fish."

Enjoy it as a starter or as part of a bigger spread. You should be able to get red mullet from the fish counter at any good supermarket, if not; your local fishmonger will definitely sort you out., With a sharp knife, slice the fish as finely as you can and put it into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper. Finely grate the zest of the limes into a separate bowl and put aside then squeeze all of the lime juice over the fish. The acid of the lime will start to cook the fish so you’ll see it start to change colour., Remove the seeds from the pomegranate halves by holding them one at a time, cut-side down, in the palm of your hand over a bowl, and bashing the back with a wooden spoon. The seeds will tumble out between your fingers into the bowl below.

Lay the fish out in a single layer on a serving platter, then sprinkle over the lime zest from a height and scatter over the pomegranate seeds. Finely grate the ginger over the top then finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a scattering of baby basil leaves."

Put a large frying pan on a medium heat. Season the trout on both sides with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add a good lug of olive oil to the pan and scatter in the thyme tips, followed by the trout, skin-side down (you may have to do this in 2 batches). Press down on the fish with a fish slice to help the skin crisp up. Cook for 4 minutes, jiggling the pan every now and then, and turning for the last 20 seconds or so to finish it off – you want to cook it about 90% of the way through on the skin side., Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix the yoghurt with the juice of ½ a lemon, the horseradish and a small pinch of salt. Have a taste to check it’s hot enough – it needs a good kick. Dress the beets with a good splash of balsamic and a small pinch of salt., Drain the potatoes then toss them with a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of oil. Squash half onto each plate. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the hot pan of fish, then transfer 2 fillets to each plate. Top each portion with a good dollop of horseradish yoghurt, a spoonful of dressed beets and a little watercress, then drizzle lightly with extra virgin olive oil and serve."

Add the yoghurt, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and half the chopped chilli.

Pick the coriander leaves and put to one side. Slice each salmon fillet across lengthways into three 1.5cm wide slices. Spoon the heaped tablespoon of tandoori paste into a small dish, then use a pastry brush or the back of a spoon to smear the tandoori paste all over each piece (don’t dip your pastry brush into the jar!). Heat a large frying pan over a high heat., Once hot, add a lug of olive oil, put the salmon into the pan and cook for about 1½ minutes on each side, until cooked through. Place a warmed naan bread on each plate. Top each one with a good dollop of cucumber yoghurt and 3 pieces of salmon. Scatter over a little of the reserved cucumber, chilli and coriander leaves and finish with a squeeze of lemon juice."

yoghurt","Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Toss the sweet potato wedges in a roasting tray with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, the paprika and a lug of olive oil. Cook in the hot oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through., Meanwhile, put the pouting fillets on a board and sprinkle over a pinch of salt and pepper and the flour, making sure they’re well coated on both sides. Dunk the floured fillets in the beaten egg then transfer them to the breadcrumbs and push and turn them until well coated on all sides., Put a large frying pan on a medium heat. Add a good lug of olive oil along with the garlic and rosemary to flavour the oil. When the garlic starts to sizzle, it’s time to add the fish. Shake the fillets so any excess breadcrumbs fall off then add to the pan, skin-side down. If you’re cooking fish fingers, they’ll need 5 to 6 minutes; a whole fillet will take 7 to 8 minutes. Don’t be tempted to touch the fish, use your instincts and let it cook until golden on the underside before flipping it over and reducing to a low heat while it finishes cooking., Meanwhile, chop off the tough ends of the basil stalks then pound the rest of it with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar until you’ve got a paste. Add the mayonnaise, yoghurt and lemon juice and muddle it all together., Serve the pouting with a portion of sweet potato chips, a good dollop of basil mayo and a wedge of lemon for squeezing over. Delicious with a crisp green salad or hot buttered peas."

Normally, when making a dressing, I stick to one type of acid, but in this case using vinegar and lemon juice together gives the dish a lovely zinginess. Pour in three times as much olive oil as vinegar, and add the capers. Season the dressing with salt and pepper. Mix everything well, then add the warm potatoes and toss around until they are all well coated., Finely grate the horseradish into a bowl – be confident with the amount you use as you need the heat to go with the salmon and potatoes – and mix it into the crème fraîche with the remaining lemon juice and some salt and pepper. Sprinkle most of the dill or fennel over the cooked potatoes and toss again., Lay your smoked salmon out on a big plate or platter. Don’t be too neat – I want you to make it look rustic! Just pinch it up here and there so that it looks wavy and pile the dressed potatoes on top. Dollop over the horseradish crème fraîche, drizzle with some olive oil and sprinkle over the rest of the dill or fennel. Served with a glass of wine and some nice bread, this makes a delicious lunch."

Drain well and, when cool enough to handle, grate on the coarse side of a cheese grater into a mixing bowl. Add the spring onions, seasoning, flour and half the butter and mix well. Divide into 4 equal balls and pat into flat rounds. Leave covered in the fridge overnight if you can., Heat a non-stick frying pan over a moderate heat and add the rest of the butter. Gently fry the potato cakes, 2 at a time, for 2 to 3 minutes each side until light brown and heated through. Keep warm., Meanwhile, soft boil the eggs for 4 minutes – this recipe works best with runny yolks. Arrange a couple of potato cakes on each plate and top with smoked salmon. Shell the eggs and place on top. Spoon soured cream over the eggs and sprinkle over the chives. Season well."

Pound the rosemary in a pestle and mortar until you have a paste. Add the anchovy fillets and pound again until the paste is dark green. Now add the lemon juice, a couple of lugs of olive oil and some pepper, and mix together until you have a sauce with a good drizzling consistency., Get a large, ovenproof, non-stick frying pan hot. Pat the salmon fillets with a little olive oil, season them with salt and pepper and cook them in the pan, skin-side down, for 2 minutes. Flip them over, then place the pan in the preheated oven for another 3 to 4 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets and the way they’ve been sliced., Just after the salmon goes into the oven, put your broccoli into some boiling, salted water for 3 to 4 minutes until perfectly cooked., To check if the fish is cooked all the way through, you can pull the fillets apart a little bit and look inside. Salmon goes from being an orangey colour to an opaque pink, so that’s what you’re looking for. Please do not overcook them, because, as simple as this dish sounds, it’s your mission to ‘just’ cook the fish so you’re rewarded with a soft inside and a slightly crispy outside – heaven!, When the broccoli’s perfectly done, drain it, toss it in a little of the anchovy-rosemary sauce and divide it between your plates. Place a salmon fillet on top of each and drizzle with some more sauce."

 lemon","To make your salsa verde, finely chop the garlic and put in a bowl. Add the capers, gherkins, anchovies, parsley, basil and mint. Mix in the mustard and 1 or 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar, then 3 good lugs of olive oil, adding more if needed to make a loose mixture. Balance the flavours with pepper and, if necessary, salt and a little more red wine vinegar., Put your new potatoes into a large pan of salted, boiling water and cook for 12 minutes with the lid on. Put the sole fillets into a clean plastic bag and season nicely with salt and pepper and a small handful of flour. Toss around until all the fillets are well coated. Just before you start cooking the fish, put your broccoli into a colander, place on top of the potato pan, cover with the lid and steam for 4 minutes or so until cooked., While the broccoli is steaming, heat a lug of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan and quickly but carefully put your fillets in so they all cook at the same time. Cook for a couple of minutes until beautifully golden, then, starting with the fillet that went in first, turn them all over. Once you’ve done that, add the butter to colour and flavour the fillets. Cook for no more than another 2 minutes. When the fillets are golden on both sides, remove the pan from the heat. Wait for 20 seconds before squeezing in the juice of ½ the lemon and shaking the pan about, otherwise the lemon juice will burn black and ruin the whole thing., Divide the fish fillets between your plates with some of the juices from the pan. Drain the potatoes and divide them and the broccoli between the plates. Spoon the salsa verde over the fish and veg, put a lemon wedge beside each and tuck in – heaven!"

Score the skin of your fish fillets all over, about 1cm deep, and season., Put the fish fillets into the pan, skin side down, with the squid tentacles. Add the scallops. Run your knife down one side of each squid to open them out, then quickly and lightly score the inside in a criss-cross fashion. Lay them in the pan, scored side down., Add the asparagus and gently shake the pan. Cook for a few minutes, then turn everything over and cook on the other side. Sprinkle over the thyme tips., You’re the one in control of the pan, so if something looks cooked, take it out and keep it warm. Don’t watch things burn! When the fish has crispy skin, the scallops are golden brown with caramelized edges and the squid has curled up and is nicely chargrilled, remove the pan from the heat., Put the squid on a chopping board and roughly slice it into pieces at an angle, then return to the pan. Lay the fish fillets on each plate. Toss the asparagus, scallops and squid with half the chilli, a good drizzle of good-quality extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice. Lightly season and mix together., Divide on top of the plated fish. Sprinkle with the rest of the chopped chilli and the fennel tops, and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil."

Add a splash of olive oil to a large pan on a high heat. Add the bacon and pine nuts and cook for a couple of minutes, or until lightly golden., Meanwhile, scatter a pinch of salt and pepper over the fish. Sprinkle over a little of the chopped parsley and finely grate over the zest of ½ a lemon. Rub that flavouring into the fish, making sure you get it into all the cuts. Repeat on the other side., Tip the bacon and pine nuts onto a plate, add another splash of oil to the pan if you need to, followed by the dab, skin-side down. You may need to cook them in 2 batches or use 2 pans. After a couple of minutes, check to see if the fish are turning golden, and once they are, flip them over. Add the tomatoes to the pan with the olives and remaining parsley. Give the pan a good shake, then add the bacon and pine nuts., Quickly dress your salad leaves with a lug of balsamic, the juice of ½ a lemon, a pinch of salt and pepper and a couple of lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Use your clean fingers to toss it all together., Cook the fish for about 6 or 7 minutes in total. To tell if it’s cooked, put your fork into the plumpest part of the flesh and if you can easily pull it away from the bone, it’s ready. Squeeze over the juice from your remaining lemon half, give the pan one last quick shake then take off the heat and serve with the salad on the side. You could have it with new potatoes too, if you like."

I used Dover sole, but any sustainable or MSC-approved flatfish like plaice, dab or lemon sole would also be fantastic. Dover sole can be a bit on the pricey side, but they are so tasty that they are a wonderful treat every now and then. You want them skinned, with the heads left on, so ask your fishmonger to do this for you. I've used fresh cockles and peeled brown shrimps, which are deliciously sweet, but way underrated. This dish is best made for two so you can cook everything together quickly in one large pan. There's something about the way these ingredients work together that makes it such a luxurious dinner. Hope you love it.., Sort through the cockles or clams and tap them. If any stay open, throw them away. Give them a wash and slush about in a bowl of cold water. Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and slice the bacon into matchsticks, then add to the pan along with a drizzle of olive oil and fry until lightly golden. Strip the leaves from the sprigs of rosemary and add to the pan. Fry for a few more minutes, then remove everything to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add a small knob of butter to the bacon fat, give it a little shake and carefully lay both fish in the hot pan, head to tail. You're going to cook them at a medium high heat, so it won't take long, but the cooking shouldn't run away from you. Cook the fish for about 4 minutes, then carefully and confidently turn each one over with a large fish slice. Quickly return the rosemary and bacon to the pan and add the shrimps and the cockles or clams. Using a tea towel to protect your hands, cover the pan immediately with a lid or tinfoil, making it as airtight as you can. Cook for another 4 minutes, or until the cockles have all opened., Finely slice the chives, then remove the foil when the time is up. Squeeze in the juice of a lemon, scatter over the chives, add a good pinch of salt and pepper, then chivvy the pan around with a sense of urgency and remove the fish to a warm platter or two plates, pouring over all the juices and seafood from the pan. Nice served with wedges of lemon on the side and a simple pea and spinach salad, some buttered asparagus or new potatoes."

Place a heavy saucepan on top so that it presses the spears right down on to the bars. Cook them for 2 minutes, turning them halfway through, until they have lovely charred marks. Pop the asparagus on a board and chop them in half at an angle., Put the asparagus in a bowl with your tomatoes, half the basil leaves, the olives, a splash of oil and a squeeze of lemon juice. Season, then toss it all together and put it to one side while you get the fish ready., Rub your tuna steaks with a little bit of oil and season them. Sear them for about a minute on each side in the griddle pan for a rare steak – leave them for 2 minutes on each side if you prefer them cooked medium, or 3 to 4 minutes each side if you like them well done., Pound the remaining basil in a pestle and mortar then mix in the yoghurt. Season and add some more lemon juice to taste., Put the salad on a plate, then tear the tuna into strips and pop them on top. Spoon over some of the basil dressing and scatter over the baby basil leaves."

and chopped, extra virgin olive oil","Get yourself a biscuit tin and place a handful or two of wood shavings into the tin, followed by your rosemary and sage sprigs. Place your wire rack in the tin, so it sits about halfway down, or bend some chicken wire to fit. Carefully pierce the lid of the tin five or six times with a screwdriver., Most salmon fillets come around the same size and thickness, so their cooking times are similar. Sprinkle the salmon fillets with salt and rub with a drizzle of olive oil. Then lay them skin side down on top of the wire (this acts like a grill rack) and put the lid on the tin., Place it on the hob, over a medium heat, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. After a couple of minutes it will start to smoke a bit., While the fish is cooking, mix all the salsa ingredients together – you can go as light or as heavy on the chillies as you like. When the fish is ready, turn the heat off and leave it to sit for 3 minutes before opening the tin. This will allow any residual smoke and heat to penetrate the fish., Lift the salmon fillets out and place on to individual serving plates. Spoon over some chilli salsa and sprinkle with your whole coriander leaves., Drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil and serve with the lime halves and the rest of the salsa in a little bowl. Lovely with some new potatoes and a green salad for lunch."

Cover with a plate and leave to do its thing., Put a griddle pan on a high heat to get nice and hot. Once it’s ready, rub a tiny bit of oil into the sardines and add them to the pan. Sprinkle over a little salt and cook for about 5 minutes., Meanwhile, mix the harissa in a small bowl with a lug of extra virgin olive oil and the juice of a lemon. Turn your sardines over in the pan then brush them lightly with the harissa sauce. Pop a lemon half, cut-side down, at the side of the griddle pan., Squash the olives with the heel of your hand, pull out and discard the stones then finely chop the flesh. Fluff up your couscous with a fork then add the spring onions, olives, mint and feta. Add a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and the juice of your remaining lemon half. Gently mix it all together then have a taste to check the balance of flavours., To check your fish is cooked go to the thickest part of the flesh and it should pinch away easily, you’ll also be able to cleanly pull the bone away. Pile the couscous on a board or on your plates and top with the sardines. Dollop a bit of yoghurt on the side topped with some of that fiery harissa sauce. Pop the rocket on the side, squeeze a little of the caramelised lemon over each portion and tuck in."

salt with the lemon zest and rosemary and rub this all over the fish fillets. Put the fillets in a dish in the fridge and let them sit there for an hour., Now make your black olive sauce by mixing all the ingredients except the vinegar together. You want the sauce to have the consistency of a coarse salsa. Then carefully balance the flavours with the vinegar to taste., If you’re roasting your monkfish, preheat your oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7 just before the fish comes out of the fridge. Pat the fish dry with some kitchen paper and then pat it with a little olive oil., Peel and halve your potatoes. Put them into a pot of salted, boiling water and cook until tender. Then drain and mash up with 6 tablespoons of olive oil and a good swig of milk. Season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice. If you want to get your mash really smooth and creamy you can use a spatula to push the potato through a sieve once or twice. It doesn’t make it taste any better but it will make it silky smooth, shiny and lovely. Just depends if you can be bothered, really. If it needs thinning with a little extra milk, feel free., To roast the monkfish, heat a large ovenproof frying pan, add a splash of olive oil and fry the fillets in the pan for 2 minutes. Then turn them over and put the pan in your preheated oven for 6 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets., To grill, place the the butterflied fillets on a hot griddle pan and cook for about 3 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness. Whichever way you cook it serve the fish and the juices with a good dollop of the mashed potato, the black olive sauce and a little rocket dressed with the extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Really, really good."

Place a griddle pan on a high heat to get it smoking hot. Using a speed peeler, slice your courgettes lengthways into lovely thin ribbons., Griddle your courgette slices until softened and lightly charred. You can do this in batches if your pan's not big enough to hold them all in one go. As they are so thin, don't worry about turning them over. Place in a bowl and add the drained beans, the chilli and mint., Rub your mackerel fillets with a little extra virgin olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Griddle them, skin side down, for 3 minutes until the skin is golden and crispy. Turn them over and cook for another 2 minutes., Dress the courgettes and beans with the juice of 1 lemon half, a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and some salt and pepper. Toss to coat everything in the dressing., Serve the mackerel fillets with a pile of the salad and a wedge of lemon to squeeze over the top., Tip: Try to find some yellow courgettes – they’ll look lovely alongside the green ones."

I didn’t grow up eating these, but they’re beautiful and so easy. A bit like bubble without the squeak. This was my first attempt at mastering them and it turned into this lovely breakfast, which I made in a pretty little flat in Glasgow’s West End. It’s the posh area of town and is full of beautiful shops and neighbourhoods. Well worth a visit.
This dish is the best brunch I can think of, besides maybe kedgeree. I never would have thought of putting this much flour with potatoes, but it works brilliantly. Give them a go with bangers, stews, on their own, or as part of this lovely brunch…I assure you this is one of the nicest ways to start the day, ever., Cut the potatoes into 2.5cm chunks and cook them in boiling salted water for around 7 minutes, or until tender. Drain them, allow them to cool, then return them to the empty pan and add the flour. Lightly mash everything together but try to avoid stirring it up too much. Finely slice the chives and add them to the potatoes with a knob of butter and the baking powder, then mash a few more times. (If you like, you can grate a little cheese into the mixture at this point – it’s delicious.) Season, then use your clean hands to bring the mixture together. Pinch off a little, taste and adjust the seasoning, then divide into 4 balls and dust with flour., Put a large frying pan (roughly 32cm) on a medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the potato balls (you may need to cook them in batches) and pat them down so they’re almost flat – 2cm thick is about right. Cook for around 10 minutes, turning them every few minutes until golden on both sides., Meanwhile, beat the eggs so they are broken and marbled. Season and put aside. When your potato scones are perfectly cooked, divide them between your plates, then take the pan off the heat and add a knob of butter. Once bubbling, pour in the eggs and put back on a low heat. Don’t be tempted to stir aggressively, use a rubber spatula to just sweep up the cooked layer of egg from the bottom of the pan every time it forms, so the uncooked egg can get down there and set. This will give you the nicest texture. The key to good scrambled egg is getting the perfect ratio of cooked silky egg and slightly less-cooked curds. To achieve that, you need to remove it from the heat once it looks three-quarters cooked – trust me. It will carry on cooking and by the time you mix it around one more time and serve, it will be gold., Arrange a piece of smoked salmon on top and add a pinch of watercress. Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil and serve with wedges of lemon for squeezing over."

Add the lemon juice, a small pinch of salt and pepper, a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and a splash of balsamic vinegar then mix everything together.

Arrange the smoked salmon in waves over a large platter. Scatter over the watercress, followed by the beetroot slices, leaving any juices behind in the bowl. Finely grate the horseradish evenly over the beetroot then spoon the juices from the beetroot over the top. Sprinkle with an extra pinch of pepper then finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and let everyone tuck in. Serve with a lovely fresh loaf of granary bread on the side."

Place the butter in a pan over a medium-low heat, add the peas and mint, pop the lid on and simmer gently for 10 minutes., Add a squeeze of lemon juice and season to taste with sea salt and black pepper – you can either mush the peas up in a food processor, or mash them by hand until stodgy, thick and perfect for dipping your fish into. Keep them warm until needed., Pour the sunflower oil into a deep fat fryer or a large sturdy pan and heat it to 190°C/375°F., Mix ½ a teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper together, then use it to season the fish fillets on both sides – this will help to remove any excess water, making the fish really meaty., Whisk the flour, beer and baking powder together until nice and shiny – the texture should be like semi-whipped double cream (i.e. it should stick to whatever you're coating)., Dust each fish fillet in a little of the extra flour, then dip into the batter and allow any excess to drip off. Holding one end, gently lower the fish into the oil one by one, working carefully so you don't get splashed – it will depend on the size of your fryer or pan how many fish you can cook at once., Cook for 4 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the batter is golden and crisp, then remove to kitchen paper to drain., Meanwhile, parboil the chips in boiling salted water for 4 to 5 minutes, or until softened but still retaining their shape, then drain and steam dry., When the chips are nice and dry, fry in the oil that the fish were cooked in at 180°C/350°F until golden and crisp., While the chips are frying, transfer the fish from the kitchen paper to a baking tray. Place in the oven for a few minutes to finish cooking – this way they will stay crisp while you finish off the chips., When the chips are done, drain them on kitchen paper, season with salt, and serve with the fish and mushy peas. Other things to have on the table are some crunchy sweet pickled gherkins, some pickled onions (if your other half isn't around!) – and pickled chillies are good, too. Then you want to douse it all with some cheap malt vinegar and nothing other than Heinz tomato ketchup."

Turn the heat down to medium-low and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the salmon and potatoes are both cooked through., Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley leaves, discarding the stalks., Once cooked, remove the fish from the colander to a plate, and discard the skin. Drain the potatoes, and leave to steam dry for 1 minute, then tip back into the pan., Mash the potatoes, spreading the mash round the sides of the pan to help it cool down quickly. When the potatoes are cooled, transfer to a bowl., Flake the salmon into the bowl, add 1 tablespoon of flour, the chopped parsley and a really good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Finely grate over the lemon zest, then mash and mix together really well., Dust a plate with a little flour. Divide the mixture into 4, then lightly shape and pat into circles about 2cm thick, dusting them with flour as you go. Put them onto a clean plate also dusted with a little flour. If you're going to freeze them, wrap them in clingfilm at this point and put them into the freezer. Otherwise simply pop them into the fridge for an hour before cooking – this will allow them to firm up slightly., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the fishcakes and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until crisp and golden – you may need to work in batches., Serve straight away, with veg or salad and lemon wedges for squeezing over."

It works really well and is beautifully refreshing. Feel free to use whatever fish looks nice and fresh, just ask your fishmonger to fillet and pin-bone it for you., Mix together a good lug of extra virgin olive oil, a nice squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper. Drizzle this all over the fish then pat on the chopped marjoram or oregano. Put your fillets on the hottest part of the grill (make sure your grill is really clean to prevent the fish from sticking)., If your fillets are 2cm thick, they’ll only need about 2 minutes cooking time. If the fish breaks up, don’t worry as you’ll be flaking it up later anyway. If it still has the skin on, cook it skin-side down as it’s less likely to stick. Once cooked, remove to a warm plate., To make the salad, finely slice the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Arrange on your plates. Finely slice your fennel bulb and dress it in a bowl with extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper then scatter over your tomatoes. Finally, spoon over your fish, flaking it as you go. Scatter over your reserved fennel tops, drizzle with the balsamic vinegar and scatter with chilli, if using, to finish."

While that's happening, I butter 2 bits of nice soft white bread or a white roll, smearing one half generously with tomato ketchup. When the fish fingers are done, I remove them from the grill and place them on the bread smeared with ketchup. The most important bit is to put the other bit of bread on top and, using a little force, push down on your buttie which, for some reason, seems to make it taste even better. And that's it – all done., I tend to eat one of these while I'm walking about at home and I always get told off by the missus for dropping bits everywhere. You'll notice from the picture that I've put a handful of rocket in the sandwich, which isn't really necessary but it does make it look a bit more posh. I was a bit embarrassed to tell the photographer he had to shoot a fish finger sandwich, so I told him it was 'lemon sole goujons' – what a prat I am! Be proud to eat fish fingers, that's what I say."

hold of saffron for this one – it’s available from most delis and good supermarkets. It’s not cheap, but bear in mind you won’t need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you haven’t got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid., To make the saffron aïoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker™ until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper., Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that aren’t tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they don’t close up, throw them away., Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little., Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that don’t open.), Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aïoli."

Season your beautiful fish fillets with the rosemary, finely grated lemon zest (no bitter white pith, please) and pepper – you don’t need to use salt because we’re going to wrap the fish in the lovely salty smoked bacon. Lay your rashers of bacon or pancetta on a board and one by one run the flat of a knife along them to thin them and widen them out. Lay 3 rashers together, slightly overlapping, put a fish fillet on top and wrap the rashers around it., Lightly heat a large ovenproof frying pan, add a splash of olive oil and lay your fish, prettiest side facing up, in the pan. Fry for a minute, then place the pan in your preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish, until the bacon is crisp and golden., While the fish is cooking, you can make your simple lemon mayonnaise. I do this by mixing quality low-fat mayonnaise with the juice of half a lemon and pepper. You want to add enough lemon juice to make the flavour slightly too zingy. This is because, when you eat it with the asparagus and the fish, it will lessen slightly in intensity. And don’t worry if the mayo looks a little thinner than usual when you’ve added the lemon juice – think of it as more delicate., The asparagus is a great accompaniment because, like the fish, it also loves bacon. You can either boil or steam it; either way it’s light and a nice contrast to the meatiness of the fish. When cooked, toss it in the juices that come out of the fish. Simply serve the fish next to a nice pile of asparagus, drizzled with the lemon-spiked mayonnaise. And if you’re feeling very hungry, serve with some steaming-hot new potatoes."

extra virgin olive oil","Mackerel is part of the same family as tuna. We’ve come to depend so heavily on tuna that it’s now under a huge amount of pressure – this really is the time to turn to mackerel as an alternative., It’s widely available in our waters and way down the food chain so we need to be buying and selling more of it, and learning how to cook and enjoy it. I like to treat mackerel more like a steak, and give it flavour and attitude to make it sing. It is so delicious, incredibly versatile and extremely good for you., Put a griddle pan on a high heat to get really hot. Add the rice to a pan with 2 mugs of boiling water and a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil on a high heat then turn the heat down to low, cover and leave for 7 to 8 minutes., Once the griddle is screaming hot, add the mackerel skin-side down (you may need to do this in batches). Use a fish slice to press the fish onto the pan. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper and finely grate over the zest of a lemon. Reduce to a medium-high heat and cook for about 8 minutes in total., Meanwhile, make your sauce. Use a fine grater to carefully grate the garlic, ginger, spring onion and chilli into a small bowl. Grate in the lime zest and mix, you should have a lovely slurry. Tear in the coriander leaves, add the sesame oil, soy sauce, honey and squeeze in the juice of the limes. Finish with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil then have a taste – you want to have a balance between sweet, sour, heat and fragrance., Check the mackerel, they should be lovely and dark on the skin side so carefully flip them over to finish cooking for a final few seconds. Check your rice; all of the water should have been absorbed. Divide the rice between your plates, top each portion with a piece of mackerel then drizzle over some of that gorgeous sauce. Scatter over the spring onion, mint, coriander and chilli, if using."

In the markets and supermarkets these days you can get some fantastic spring vegetables: baby carrots with tops, baby fennel with its herby leaves, baby turnips, peas and broad beans, fine green and yellow French beans, all really colourful and easy to cook with. Here's a nice little combination – it's all cooked in the same pot and gives you a lovely broth. The only thing you have to do is control the cooking times by adding the veg that need longer in the pot first., First, make the aioli. When you've done that, bring your stock to the boil in a large pan then add your fennel and allow this to boil for 4 minutes while you heat up a non-stick frying pan. Take your salmon steaks and, if you fancy it, you could finely slice a little of your mint and basil and push this into the score marks. Pat the salmon steaks with a little olive oil, season and place skin-side down in the frying pan. Leave them for 2 minutes to get really crispy then check how they're doing. They'll want around 4 minutes on the skin side and 1 minute on the other. You'll get an idea of how they're cooking as you'll see the salmon change colour., When the fennel has had 4 minutes, add the green beans and the broad beans. Give them a further 2 minutes. By this time you will probably want to turn over the salmon steaks for their last minute. Add the peas to the other veg and cook for a final 2 minutes. Don't be tempted to overcook the salmon – remove it from the heat. Divide the vegetables between 4 bowls, rip over the mint and basil, ladle over some of your hot cooking stock and place the salmon on top. Serve with a dollop of aïoli. Fantastic!"

If your barbie is small, feel free to cut the salmon in half to make it more manageable., Place the salmon skin side down on a plastic board and, using a sharp knife, slash it evenly all over on the fleshy side, making the incisions about 1cm deep., Grate the lemon zest and most of the chopped fennel tops or basil over the salmon, then push these flavourings into the incisions – don’t hold back; really push them in!, Rub the fish lightly all over with olive oil then season with salt and pepper, giving the skin side a generous amount as most of this will fall off., When your barbie’s ready, lay the salmon on the bars, skin side down. The flesh will start to colour from the bottom up and after about 4 minutes the skin should be beautifully golden brown., Carefully flip the salmon over with a roasting fork or a spatula and cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes on the other side. While it’s cooking, gently ease the skin away from the fish and put it on the barbie alongside to crisp up.

If your salmon is wild it will have slightly less fat in it, so will be a drier fish. You can therefore cook it for a shorter amount of time, even leaving it slightly undercooked – although this might feel unusual to us Brits, who nuke fish beyond belief, this is a really good idea!, If it’s (organically) farmed, cook it through, but please don’t overcook it or it will become too dry. Lift the salmon carefully off the barbecue and place it on a nice serving platter or board. Allow to cool a little, then break the skin into pieces, a bit like poppadoms., Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, remove and discard the seeds, chop it up and mix it in a bowl with the yoghurt. Balance the flavours with the lemon juice, half the chopped chilli, and half the chopped mint or oregano., Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil. Season carefully to taste with salt and pepper., Break the salmon up with a fork into four to six chunks. Serve with the cucumber yoghurt, sprinkled with the rest of the chopped chilli and the remaining fennel tops or basil. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and make sure everyone gets a piece of the crunchy fish skin."

Bring to the boil on a high heat, then turn the heat down to low, cover and leave for 7 to 8 minutes., Put a large frying pan on a medium heat. Use the back of a spoon to spread 1 heaped tablespoon of the korma paste all over the flesh side of the fish fillets. Add a lug of oil to the hot pan, then add the coley, flesh-side down. Cook for about 10 minutes, turning halfway when you’ve got some colour., Trim and finely slice the spring onions and chilli, keeping them separate. Pick the coriander leaves, then finely chop the stalks., Check your rice – all of the water should have been absorbed by now so fluff it up with a fork and take it off the heat. Pop the lid back on so it stays warm., Turn the heat up to high on the fish and throw in the greener half of your sliced spring onions. Stir in the remaining korma paste, coconut milk, coriander stalks and most of the fresh chilli., Let it bubble away for a couple of minutes until the fish starts to flake apart. Taste your sauce and add a squeeze of lemon juice if it needs it., Divide the rice between your plates then top each portion with a piece of coley. Pour the sauce over the top, then scatter over the reserved spring onions, chilli and coriander leaves. Serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over."

conversations with Icelandic and Danish friends who prize their cod. Traditionally, they prepare it in lots of different ways; pickled, salted, dried or smoked. This stew is similar to the way in which they slowly stew salt cod after soaking it (so that the excess salt seasons the other ingredients in the soup, like the potatoes). Good salt cod is quite hard to find these days, so I've adapted the recipe to use fresh cod, but you can also use hake, bass or halibut., In an appropriately sized large pan, slowly fry your onion and leek with around 5 tablespoons of olive oil for 5 minutes until soft and tender. With a teaspoon, remove and discard the fluffy tasteless core from the courgettes and grate the rest into the pan., Chop the potatoes into rough 2cm dice and add to the pan. Give everything a good stir and then add the anchovies. Turn the heat up and add the white wine. Allow to cook down by half before adding your milk and stock., Bring to the boil and simmer for half an hour until the potatoes are tender. At this point, add your cod and simmer for a further 15 minutes until the flesh flakes away; feel free to stir and break up the fish, but it's quite nice to leave some big chunks as well., Season carefully to taste. Divide between your bowls, and serve with a small handful of parsley and spring onion dressed with a little olive oil and lemon juice., Try this: Sprinkle a little orange zest over the parsley and spring onion. It really works with the cod."

Add the piece of tuna. Tie up the bag, squeezing out most of the air so the tuna is completely covered in the juice. Leave for 40 minutes, after which time the outside of the tuna will be pale and ""cooked"". Now carefully pour the grapefruit juice from the bag into a bowl, dry off the tuna and put to one side., For the dressing, mix the sesame oil, olive oil and chillies into the grapefruit juice. Use as much chilli as you like, and season to taste. Tear off a good handful of coriander and mint from the bunches and put to one side to use for garnish later. Finely chop the remaining herbs and really pat these around the tuna to encrust it. Wrap in cling film and place in the fridge until needed., Boil the noodles for 1 minute until they are slightly flexible, drain and allow to steam dry and cool. Add a little olive oil to a hot non-stick pan, add your noodles and leave them until they are nice and crisp on one side. Now flip them over and do the same on the other side – it doesn't matter if some stick to the pan, just scrape them up and turn them over. Divide the crispy noodles between 4 plates. Slice your tuna up about 0.5cm thick – in Japan it's a sign of generosity to have nice thick slices of tuna, but I like them a little thinner as they are more delicate in the mouth., Place the tuna on the noodles, sprinkle over the torn-up herbs that you put to one side earlier, sprinkle with the spring onions and then drizzle a couple of spoonfuls of the dressing over the tuna. Before your eyes you will see the cut sides of the slices of fish begin to change colour and ""cook"". Serve straight away."

Add the lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of olive oil and stir until you have a good drizzling consistency., Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add your peas and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, then remove them with a slotted spoon or sieve. Add the broad beans to the pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, depending on their size. Drain and leave to cool, then pinch the skins off any big beans (you can leave the skin on any small or medium ones)., To dress the peas and beans you want the same balance of acid and oil as you would have in a salad dressing. So, put the olive oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper into a large bowl. Chop up most of the mint and throw it in, add the peas and beans and mix everything around. Add lemon juice to taste. You can serve the dressed peas and beans hot or at room temperature., Heat a griddle pan or barbecue until hot, season your tuna steaks with salt and pepper and pat with some of the oregano oil. Place in the pan and sear for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Personally, I like to keep my tuna a little pink in the middle as this tastes much nicer, but if you’re going to cook it through please don’t nuke it., Tear the tuna into 2 or 3 pieces and toss in a large bowl with the rest of the oregano oil. This will give you a lovely combination of flavours. Serve the fish immediately with the peas and broad beans scattered with the rest of the mint leaves., P.S. Sometimes I love to throw random delicate greens like baby spinach, watercress, even rocket, in with the broad beans for 30 seconds before you drain them. The combination of peppery irony greens, creamy broad beans and sweet little peas makes the veg taste even better."

It's a terrific hot snack or main dish – and with the tuna all torn up it makes a great salad. I like to griddle the tuna for a minute on each side so it has colour on the outside but still remains a little pink in the middle. A lot of people still want to cook tuna all the way through (which I think is madness!), but you must do it how you like best. It's worth seeing if you prefer it pink in the middle though. I'm really going heavy on the herbs in this recipe – 4 or 5 years ago this might have been a bit OTT, but it's really easy to get hold of a good selection of herbs now, so the more the merrier., Feel free to use a couple of tins of beans if it's more convenient. Tinned beans aren't bad these days – they have got much better for some reason. But if you're using dried, which still taste better, soak them overnight in water. They'll double in size. You then just need to drain them and put them into a pan with fresh water to cover. Bring to the boil, then simmer them for around 40 minutes or until tender – sometimes I put a squashed tomato and a potato in the water with them, as it helps to soften the skins. When done, drain them, discarding the tomato and potato, and put them into a large bowl with 8 tablespoons of peppery olive oil, the red onion, anchovies and chillies. Season with salt and pepper and the lemon juice – for a bit of a twang., Preheat your griddle pan until really hot. Season the tuna steaks with salt and pepper, sprinkle over the lemon zest and pat a little olive oil on both sides. Sear the steaks for a minute on each side. While the fish is searing, get your guests round the table. Throw the herbs into the dressed beans, mix up and divide between the plates. Take the tuna off the heat, tear it up and place on top of the warm beans. Nice with some cold white wine."

Make sure your fish is from a sustainable source, and if you can’t find sustainable red mullet, go for small red snapper instead., First get your barbecue going, with the coals piled up high on one side so it's super hot and low on the other side for a more gentle heat to give you some control., With a sharp knife, score each of your fish all over on both sides, about 1cm deep. This helps the flavours to get into the fish and will allow the heat right in so the fish gets cooked evenly right down to the bone., Get a big chopping board ready. Roughly chop the oregano leaves, then scatter them over the board. Sprinkle over a generous amount of salt and pepper. Roll the fish over board, pushing them down and rubbing the flavourings into the slashes., Place fish on to the hot side of the barbie to give them a bit of colour. You’ll be making your salsa on the cooler side (or on your hob). Just heat a little olive oil in a frying pan, add the chopped olives and warm them through for a minute or so. Add the garlic, chilli and rosemary sprigs, give it a good toss and gently fry while you finish cooking your fish., After about 4 minutes, turn the fish over by easing them off the grill with a fish slice – be patient otherwise they will stick – and cook for another 4 minutes until cooked and moist on the inside, with a crispy skin on the outside., Remove and discard the sprigs of rosemary from the frying pan; they will have released lots of flavour so they've done their job. Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan and toss. Squeeze in the lemon juice and add the parsley leaves. Give the salsa a taste. Olives are usually quite salty so you probably don’t need any more salt but that's your call. I might add a little pepper though. Once everything is warmed through, take the pan off the heat., Remove the fish to a plate. To make sure they are cooked, pull a bit of the meat away from the bone. If it comes away easily, you're in business., Serve the fish simply with some salsa spooned over the top., P.S. If you've got any leftovers, what I like to do is pull the fish away from the bone and flake it into a bowl. Toss with the leftover salsa, add some extra torn parsley leaves or peppery rocket, and serve with some nice bread."

Pick the basil leaves and finely slice the stalks., Heat a good couple of lugs of oil in a large pan over medium heat, add the garlic and basil stalks. Pierce the chilli once with a knife so it doesn’t explode when frying, then add to the pan. Fry gently until the garlic is soft but not coloured, stirring occasionally., Add the tomatoes and season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, then simmer gently over a low heat for 30 minutes, or until thickened and slightly reduced., When the time's up, remove the chilli, and break up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed, then add a tiny swig of red wine vinegar to give it a little twang., Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7., Pour the tomato sauce into a 20cm x 30cm roasting tray. Season the fish fillets on both sides with a little salt and pepper, then place on top of the sauce., Squash the olives, using the base of a jar or something heavy, and remove the stones. Sprinkle into the tray, along with the capers and most of the basil leaves over the fish., Cook in the oven for around 15 minutes or until the fish is cooked through – check by cutting into the thickest part of one or two of the fillets; they should be pearly white and not transparent., Scatter over the remaining basil leaves. Lovely served with new potatoes and a green salad."

Each mouthful is an outrageously delicious bit of heaven that anyone sensible won’t be able to resist. The contrast of hot crispy soft Yorkshire pudding and cold creamy smoky trout with a good hit of horseradish is unbelievable. You can put the creamy smoked fish in one big serving bowl if you like, but I think it’s quite sweet to make up a few individual servings in little teacups. Around May and June you’ll start to see flowering chives around, and those are beautiful for decorating the top of the potted fish if you’re out to impress. This is dead quick, so easy and absolutely perfect for a starter – just whack it right in the middle of the table so everyone can help themselves. Your guests will be fighting over it, I promise., Put the cream cheese into a mixing bowl with the horseradish, the zest of 1 lemon and the juice from half, and mix together. Mix in most of the chopped chives, then have a taste and add a pinch of salt and pepper. It’s very important that this mixture has a bolshie attitude – it should be hot, smoky, salty, so add more horseradish or lemon juice if needed. Flake in the trout, removing any skin and bones, then use a spatula to fold the mixture together gently so you have smaller bits and nice chunks. Decant into a single nice serving dish or several little bowls or cups, then drizzle over a little rapeseed oil and sprinkle over a few more chopped chives. Cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge to get nice and cold., When you’re nearly ready to eat, preheat the oven to full whack (about 240°C/475°F/gas 9) while you make your Yorkshire pudding batter. Get yourself a mini muffin tin (you can buy these easily online or in cooks’ shops) and pour a little thimble of vegetable oil into the 16 compartments of the tin, so you have a thin layer covering the bottom of each. Pop the tray on to the top shelf in the hot oven for around 10 to 15 minutes, so the oil gets so hot that it smokes. While you’re doing that, aggressively beat the eggs, flour, milk and a pinch of salt and pepper together, either by hand or in a food processor, until light and smooth. Transfer the mixture into a jug., Carefully take the tray out of the oven and quickly and confidently pour the batter into the hot tin so it nearly fills each well. Return the tray to the top shelf of the oven to cook for around 10 to 12 minutes, or until the Yorkies are puffed up and golden. Whatever you do, don’t open the oven door! Get your cold cups and bowls of potted fish out of the fridge and serve on a board with those sizzling hot little Yorkies and some lemon wedges., To. Die. For."

Scrape it into a bowl with half the coriander leaves and all the stalks., In a separate bowl, mix the lime zest and juice with the ginger, sesame oil, extra virgin olive oil and soy sauce to make a delicious dressing. Have a taste, and tweak with extra lime, oil or soy until you’ve got a good balance., Pour the dressing over your tuna and gently mix together – as soon as the acid from the limes hits the tuna it will begin to cook it so you only need to mix lightly., Click off the stronger outer leaves of your little gem lettuces – you want about 16 in total. Wash them and spin dry well, then line them up on a board. The leaves are going to act as a vessel to hold your ceviche., Divide the tuna ceviche between the lettuce leaves, sprinkle with a little fresh chilli, if using, the reserved coriander leaves, then serve straight away."

good lug of olive oil in a large pan on a medium heat. Add the onions and celery and cook for 5 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft but not coloured., Add the tomatoes, potatoes and bay leaves and pour in the stock. Season lovingly with sea salt and black pepper and bring it all to the boil. Reduce to a low heat and simmer for 15 minutes. At this point, add your fish fillets and bring back to the boil, then reduce to a medium-low heat and simmer for a further 15 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and the fish is cooked through and flakes apart. Stir in the lemon juice and herbs, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, then have a quick taste to make sure you've got a good balance of acidity, freshness and seasoning and serve with chunks of rustic bread."

Pop it in the fridge and marinate for about 10 minutes., In a large frying pan, layer up the onion, tomatoes and peppers before finishing with the fish. Drizzle a little olive oil over everything and sprinkle on the coriander. Pop the lid on and cook over a medium heat for 15 minutes, until the veg is softened., Pour in the coconut cream and a splash of water, but don't be tempted to stir it. Pop the lid back on and continue to cook for 5 minutes., Sift in the paprika and cook, uncovered, for a further 15 minutes. Scatter over a little extra coriander and serve with rice on the side."

Knead for a couple of minutes, then put aside., Peel the kiwi fruit, cut in half and put into a large dry non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with the green halves of the spring onions and the deseeded chilli., Lightly scald it all, turning every now and again, then place in a blender with half the coriander, the juice of 1 lime and a few shakes of chipotle Tabasco. Blitz until smooth, then taste and season to perfection., Very finely slice the red cabbage, ideally on a mandolin (use the guard!), scrunch with the remaining coriander leaves and the vinegar and orange juice, then season to perfection., To make your tacos, divide the dough into four balls and roll out each one thinly. Cook each through in a non-stick pan for just 1 minute on each side until soft, turning when you see bubbles. Cover with a tea towel to keep warm., Slice up the whites of the spring onions. Deseed the pepper and cut into 1cm dice. Slice the fish into 2cm strips, then toss with the spring onion, pepper and 1 tablespoon of oil., Return the pan you used for your tacos to a high heat and cook the fish mixture for around 4 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and lightly golden., Divide the yoghurt, fish and veg between your warm tacos. Serve with the dressed red cabbage, that killer salsa and lime wedges for squeezing over, then devour!"
