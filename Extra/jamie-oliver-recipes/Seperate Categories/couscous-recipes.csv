Pour in just enough boiling kettle water to cover, pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up., Peel and finely slice 2 cloves of garlic, then pick and finely chop the leaves from 3 sprigs of fresh rosemary., When the time’s up, remove the tray from the oven and transfer the mushrooms to a plate., Place the roasting tray on the hob over a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, add the garlic and rosemary and cook for 1 minute, then stir in the 2 tablespoons of baby capers and 2 x 400g tins of cherry tomatoes.

Quarter the peppers and halve the tomatoes, removing and discarding the seeds. Break the unpeeled garlic bulb into cloves. Mix it all in a large sturdy roasting tray with 2 tablespoons each of olive oil and red wine vinegar, the harissa, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and a good splash of water., Cover the tray tightly with tin foil, put it on a medium heat on the hob, and when it starts to sizzle, transfer it to the oven for 40 minutes., Get the tray out of the oven, remove the foil, tilt the tray and spoon all the delicious juices into a little jug for later. Return the tray to the oven for 20 minutes, to get golden., Place the couscous in a bowl, add a pinch of salt and pepper, then just cover with boiling kettle water, and cover., Pick most of the mint leaves into a blender, blitz with 6 tablespoons of yoghurt until smooth, then ripple it back through the remaining yoghurt., Fluff up the couscous. Warm the reserved juices. Squeeze the soft garlic out of the skin. Serve it all together, sprinkled with mint leaves."

Finely grate in the zest of ½ a lemon, squeeze in half the juice, then add the squeezed half for extra flavour. Just cover with boiling kettle water – get an adult to help you if you need to. Cover the bowl and put aside., Now, very carefully push 3 skewers horizontally into each chicken breast (if the skewers are too long, cut them in half). Wash your hands, then season the chicken breasts with black pepper, squeeze over the juice of ½ a lemon and drizzle with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil., You can cook the skewers on a hot barbecue or in a hot frying pan on the hob. Always get an adult to help you! Either way, cook the skewers for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning regularly with tongs. For the final minute of cooking, grab your rosemary sprigs and use them to brush the honey over the chicken, giving it a lovely sticky glaze., To make a zingy salsa, first clean down your board. Halve, deseed and finely chop the pepper. Peel and finely chop the onion and the pineapple, then pop everything in a bowl, dress with a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, then season to perfection. If you’ve got them, finely chop some fresh soft herbs using the cross-chop method, and add to the mix., Uncover the couscous, fluff it up with a fork, and divide between your plates., On a clean board, use a sharp knife to slice the chicken between the skewers. Check that it’s cooked and if it needs another minute or two, simply put it back on the barbecue., Place 3 chicken lollipops on each plate, and serve with the pineapple and pepper salsa, natural yoghurt, for dipping, and lemon wedges, for squeezing over."

Remove the aubergines to the platter and reduce the heat under the pan to low., Peel and slice the garlic, prick the chillies and place both in the pan with the cinnamon, woody herbs and capers., Stir and fry for a couple of minutes while you peel and finely slice the onions, then stir them into the pan, too.

Chicken skewers recipe | Jamie Oliver recipes,with couscous salad & lemony yoghurt,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/46294690.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",In35 minutes,"“Serving chunks of tender chicken on skewers with a zingy lemon-spiked yoghurt and crushed nuts for dipping is both fun and delicious. Chicken breast is not only the leanest cut from the bird, but it’s also high in phosphorus, which you need to keep your bones and teeth strong and healthy. Served with a lovely couscous salad with plenty of fresh parsley, ripe tomatoes and lemon juice, this is a great, healthy twist on a Middle-Eastern mezze. You’ll need the skewers to fit comfortably in your pan, so quickly double check before you start, cutting them to fit, if needed. ”",645,19.0g,3.3g,13.6g,0.9g,45.0g,75.6g,3.6g,"150                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                green beans, 150                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                couscous, 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh flat-leaf parsley                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                ripe plum tomatoes, ½                                                                                                                                                                a                                                                                                                                                                red onion, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    free-range chicken breasts, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 2                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh rosemary, olive oil, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                fat-free natural yoghurt, 25                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                cashew nuts","Fill a medium pan with water and bring to the boil., Meanwhile, trim and chop the beans into 3cm pieces, then add to the pan.

Lightly toast, then transfer to a board and roughly chop., Return the pan to the heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, add the chicken and fry for 8 to 10 minutes, or until cooked through, turning regularly., Season the couscous, then spoon onto serving plates adding the chopped nuts in little piles alongside., On a clean board, slice the chicken between the skewers, then place 3 on each plate. Serve with the yoghurt for dipping and dunking in the crunchy nuts."

Finely grate over the zest from 1 lemon, then just cover with boiling kettle water. Pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up., Once done, remove the asparagus to the plate, crumble 20g of flaked almonds into the pan to toast until lightly golden, then remove., Use the base of a pan to flatten the thicker side of 2 chicken breasts slightly, then use three wooden skewers to pierce each chicken breast at regular intervals. Sprinkle both breasts with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and rub with 1 teaspoon of oil., Place the chicken breasts in the pan for 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, but still juicy, turning every couple of minutes, and returning the asparagus to the pan for the last minute to warm through., Meanwhile, mix 2 heaped of teaspoons sun-dried tomato paste with 2 tablespoons of yoghurt and half the lemon juice until smooth. Fluff up the couscous, squeeze over the remaining lemon juice, then pick, finely chop and stir in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh mint. Taste and season to perfection., Slice between the skewers to create chicken lollipops ready to dunk in the sun-dried tomato yoghurt and coat in the crunchy almonds, then serve up with the couscous and asparagus."

Chickpea stew recipe | Jamie Oliver chickpea recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/46337837.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",In40 minutes,"“This is a delicious dish with great depth of flavour. I’ve used spices and ingredients that might make you think of Morocco or Tunisia – cinnamon and chilli, dried fruit and even couscous – but because North Africa is so close to Sicily, their styles of cooking can be surprisingly similar. Cauliflower is super-high in both vitamin C and folic acid, both of which help our brains to think properly. Along with protein-rich chickpeas and wholewheat couscous, which is higher in fibre than regular couscous, I’ve packed this dinner with plenty of nutritious goodness.

Incredible Sicilian aubergine stew with couscous | Jamie Oliver,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/46337877.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",In30 minutes,"“This is a fantastic dish from southern Italy that the Sicilians are super proud of – and so they should be – it’s a complete joy to eat. The trick is not to cut the aubergine chunks too small or they will take on too much oil and become heavy, instead of having the lovely creamy flavour and texture we’re aiming for. Jam-packed with veg, this recipe adds up to two of your 5-a-day, and using wholewheat couscous, instead of the regular stuff, will help keep you fuller for longer because it’s higher in fibre.

Heat a couple of lugs of olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat, add the aubergine, oregano and a little sea salt, then toss to coat., Turn the heat up to high and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, giving the pan a shake every now and then., While that’s ticking away, peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Pick and chop the parsley leaves and finely chop the stalks, then roughly chop the tomatoes., When the aubergine is golden all over, add the onion, garlic and parsley stalks, then cook for a further 2 minutes – if the aubergine gets too dry, add a little more oil to the pan., Drain and add the capers, destone and add the olives, then drizzle over the vinegar., When all the vinegar has evaporated, add the tomatoes and simmer for around 15 minutes, or until the aubergine is tender., Put the couscous into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and just cover with boiling water, then pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up., Lightly toast the almonds in a dry pan over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden, keeping them moving., Use a fork to fluff up the couscous and stir through half the chopped parsley., Season the stew to taste, then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil., Serve the stew with the couscous and sprinkle with the almonds and remaining parsley."

onions, then trim and finely slice the fennel., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan, add the onions and fennel, along with the chilli flakes, fennel seeds and cinnamon and cook slowly for 10 to 15 minutes, or until soft and sticky., Meanwhile, add the saffron to a small cup, top up with a little hot water and set aside – this will draw the flavour out of the strands and allow it to mix evenly in the pan when you add it., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a high heat, add the chicken thighs and drumsticks and brown on all sides, adding them to the veg pan when golden., Pour in the saffron-infused water, followed by the tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Fill the empty tin with water, pour into the pan and mix together., Add the bay, finely slice and add the preserved lemons, roughly chop and add the fresh tomatoes and destone and tear in the olives., Season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then leave to bubble away for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken starts to fall off the bone and the sauce has thickened and reduced., Put the couscous into a bowl and just cover with boiling salted water, then pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up., Serve the chicken and couscous, scattered with picked coriander."

Pick over a few large mint leaves and throw on a good pinch of salt and pepper., Chop, chop, chop until you have finely chopped greens. Scrape these straight into your lunchbox, pour the uncooked couscous on top and gently sit a lemon half in it., Toast the seeds in a dry frying pan, then mix with the cumin and wrap in clingfilm, so they stay crisp until you’re ready to eat., In a small jar, add the juice from the remaining lemon half, a good swig of olive oil (twice as much oil as juice is a good ratio), the harissa and a few small mint leaves, then crumble in the feta. Mix well, screw the lid on and put in your lunchbox., At lunchtime, boil the kettle. Take the lemon, seeds and jar from your lunchbox, then pour in boiling water to just cover the couscous., Pop the lid on and wait 8 to 10 minutes until the water is absorbed and the spinach is wilted. Squeeze in the lemon juice, pour over the dressing and mix with a fork. Sprinkle with seeds before eating."

Seven-veg tagine | Vegetables recipes | Jamie magazine,"Chickpeas, pumpkin, carrot & aubergine","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/C1SAkHfsqFU890V3KAY0eB.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '6']",In55 minutes,"“Tagine is Morocco’s best-known dish: a slow-cooked stew made with lamb, chicken or fish and vegetables. It’s named after the conical-lidded pot that the stew is traditionally cooked in – the design allows steam to condense back into the dish as it cooks, to retain its juices. This vegetarian tagine doesn’t need meat for flavour – the vegetables absorb the essences of the coriander, cumin, saffron, ginger and tomato-y stock. The vegetables should be chunky so they hold their shape during the slow cooking. Serve the tagine as the Moroccans do – over some nutty-tasting couscous. ”",308,3.5g,0.5g,9.8g,,13.8g,51.8g,,"400

Make a note of the cooking instructions (you can get these from the couscous packet) and stick them to the jar. ”",365,2.6g,0.3g,7.7g,0g,13.1g,69.5g,-g,"CRANBERRY & PISTACHIO COUSCOUS, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                couscous, ½–1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                dried chilli flakes, ½–1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                dried mint, ½–1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                dried parsley, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                dried cranberries, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                sultanas, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                shelled pistachios, CARDAMOM & PUMPKIN SEED COUSCOUS, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                couscous, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                pumpkin seeds, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    cardamom pods, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                ras-el-hanout                                                                                                                                                                , (see tip)","Decide which couscous to make, then simply combine all the ingredients in a bowl and season., If making the Cranberry & pistachio couscous, crush the pistachios before adding, and if you choose the Cardamom & pumpkin seed couscous, crush the cardamom pods first., Spoon into bags or glass jars."

Toss the chicken in the marinade and leave aside., Blanch the greens in a large pan of boiling water until just tender enough to eat but still vibrant in colour, then drain, reserving the water., In a bowl, just cover the couscous with boiling greens water, season, pop a plate on top and leave for 10 minutes. Pick and finely chop the mint leaves and stir into the fluffy couscous with the juice of half a lemon, then season to perfection., Toast the hazelnuts in a large dry non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat, removing and crushing in a pestle and mortar once lightly golden., Return the frying pan to a high heat and cook the chicken for 4 minutes on each side, or until cooked through, turning halfway and adding the peppers when you flip the chicken. Reheat the greens, if needed., Meanwhile, you can either make a quick houmous (put three-quarters into the fridge for another day if making a full batch) or simply use yoghurt – both options are delicious., Serve the chicken with the couscous, peppers, greens and houmous or yoghurt, scattered with the hazelnuts and with a lemon wedge on the side.

Muddle in 1 tablespoon of oil, the paprika, saffron and a swig of boiling water to make a marinade., Use little scissors to cut down the back of each prawn shell and remove the vein. Cut 1 orange into wedges, toss with the prawns and the marinade and leave aside for 10 minutes., Put the couscous into a bowl and just cover with boiling water, then pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up., Take a bit of pride in finely chopping all your colourful seasonal veg and chilli, and put them into a nice serving bowl., Pick a few pretty mint leaves and put to one side, then pick and finely chop the rest and add to the bowl with the juice of the lemon and the remaining orange. Add the couscous, toss together and season to perfection., Put a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat. Add the prawns, marinade and orange wedges and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the prawns are gnarly and crisp, then arrange on top of the couscous., Dollop with yoghurt, then halve the pomegranate and, holding it cut side down in your fingers, bash the back so the sweet jewels tumble over everything. Sprinkle with the reserved mint leaves and serve."

big pinch of salt into a bowl. Stir to combine, then pour over just enough boiling water to cover the couscous. Cover the bowl and leave for about 10 minutes., Meanwhile, finely chop the onion, cucumber, tomatoes and chilli (I leave the seeds in, but deseed if you prefer). Finely chop the mint and coriander leaves, and the parsley (including the stalks)., Mix the couscous up with a fork, then stir in the tomato purée until well coated (I do this with my hands – it’s messy, but quite therapeutic!). Add all the chopped vegetables, chilli and herbs and mix well. Stir in the oil and the lemon zest and juice, then season to how you like it. Serve as a side with grilled meat or fish or eat it on its own if you want a light meal or snack."

If you like, a mint sauce would make a great accompaniment. Pretty delish!, Preheat the oven to 200°C. Place the chicken on a board and make some deep crisscross slashes into the legs – this will help the spices to penetrate the meat, and will also help it to cook more quickly. Halve the lemon and place inside the chicken, then rub the chicken skin all over with olive oil, a little sea salt, pepper and the cumin. Transfer the chicken to a roasting tray and place in the hot oven., Peel and quarter the onions and carrots. When the chicken’s been cooking for around 15 minutes, reduce the heat to 180°C and add the onions and carrots to the tray. Roast for a further hour, or until golden and cooked through – the chicken is cooked when the thigh meat pulls easily away from the bone and the juices run clear., Once perfectly cooked, carefully lift the chicken onto a plate or board and cover with tin foil and a couple of tea towels to keep warm. Spoon the vegetables onto a board and roughly chop them, then tip back into the tray and place on a medium heat. Pour in 500ml boiling water and stir well, making sure you scrape up all the lovely sticky goodness from the bottom of the tray., Drain and roughly chop the peppers, then add them to the tray with the smoked paprika, ground coriander and the couscous. Pull the lemon halves out of the chicken with a pair of tongs and squeeze the juices into the tray (making sure to catch any pips). Bring to the boil, then turn the heat off and leave to rest for 5 minutes, or until the couscous has absorbed all of the water. Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the mint leaves. When the time’s up, fluff up the couscous using a fork and stir through the chopped mint. Drizzle with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and everything together., Cut the chicken up into joints, removing the skin if you want to keep it healthy, then serve with the tasty roast-vegetable couscous. Enjoy!, Jamie's Tip: Basting a chicken as it cooks helps to stop it drying out, giving you lovely, juicy meat. Check on the chicken every 20 to 30 minutes, and spoon any juices from the bottom of the tray back over the bird."

Zest and juice 2 of the lemons. In a food processor, whiz together the onion, garlic, all the parsley stalks and half the parsley leaves. When everything’s finely chopped, scoop into a bowl and add the couscous, 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and half of the lemon juice. Stir in the hot stock and season well. Stir again and leave to the side for a couple of minutes., The fish should pretty much all be prepared by your fishmonger. Make sure the sea bass fillets are halved and the skin of both the sea bass and the red mullet is slashed with a sharp knife. Chop a few of the parsley and mint leaves and stuff them into the slashes – this looks pretty, flavours the fish and helps to crisp up the skin. Place all the fish and shellfish into a bowl, drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil, season and mix together., Spoon the couscous into a roasting tray or ovenproof dish. Spread it out, then arrange the fish and shellfish over the top, in a single layer. Make sure the fillets are placed skin-side up. Drizzle over the remaining lemon juice, a little more olive oil and sprinkle with half of the lemon zest., Cut the remaining 2 lemons in half and put on top of the couscous. Place in the oven and roast for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the skin of the fillets is crispy around the edges., While your fish is cooking, make the salsa. Finely chop the remaining parsley and mint leaves and put into a bowl. Add the cinnamon and remaining lemon zest. Finely chop the plum tomatoes and roasted peppers and add to the herb mixture. Season, stir and set aside., Once the fish is cooked, you are ready to serve. Make sure everyone gets a portion of couscous and a bit of all the different fish, and spoon over some salsa and garnish with the roasted lemon."

but what a great dish! Omega 3 refers to all the lovely goodness that you get from oily fish like red mullet, sardines and fresh anchovies, so do feel free to use any one of these, or a mixture of them. This is also great served with linguine pasta instead of couscous., First of all, lay your fish out in one layer on your worktop to give you an idea of how much you are dealing with. Next get yourself a pan with a lid – ideally one that’s the right size for the fish to be spread out in one layer. This is so that it can all cook at the same time. Put your pan on the heat, add 4 or 5 tablespoons of olive oil, and slowly fry your onions, fennel, chilli, fennel seeds and bay leaf with the lid on until nice and softened. This should take about 10 minutes., Meanwhile put your couscous in a bowl and just cover it with salted, boiling water. Put to one side to soak for about 5 minutes. When the onions are sweet and soft, add the tomatoes and anchovies, stir together and carefully season to taste. Shake the pan so that the onions and tomatoes cover the bottom of the pan evenly. Dress the couscous lightly with a little olive oil and the juice and zest of one of the lemons. Sprinkle the couscous over the top of the onions and tomatoes in one even layer. Then place the fish over the top of that and finish off with a drizzle of olive oil. Place the lid on top and simmer slowly on the hob for about 12 minutes., Meanwhile, season the yoghurt with salt, pepper and the remaining lemon juice and sprinkle over the reserved fennel tops and mint. Serve the pan of fish in the middle of the table with a bowl of yoghurt and let everyone help themselves. Lightly stir the fish up, check the seasoning and eat straight away."

Add the diced lamb, the garlic, red pepper and tomato puree. Stir in the tomato base sauce, or tinned tomatoes, water and basil. Add salt to taste, cover with a lid or a couple of tight layers of foil, then simmer on a low heat for around 1½ hours  or transfer into a deep baking tin cover with foil and finish cooking it in the oven at 150°C/300°F/gas 2 for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender., Tip the dry couscous into a serving tin. Then pour the boiling vegetable stock on to the couscous - it should just cover it. Leave to stand for 10 minutes and then fluff up with a fork just before serving., Serve the lamb with couscous and a mixed leaf salad."

Cover with a plate and leave to do its thing., Put a griddle pan on a high heat to get nice and hot. Once it’s ready, rub a tiny bit of oil into the sardines and add them to the pan. Sprinkle over a little salt and cook for about 5 minutes., Meanwhile, mix the harissa in a small bowl with a lug of extra virgin olive oil and the juice of a lemon. Turn your sardines over in the pan then brush them lightly with the harissa sauce. Pop a lemon half, cut-side down, at the side of the griddle pan., Squash the olives with the heel of your hand, pull out and discard the stones then finely chop the flesh. Fluff up your couscous with a fork then add the spring onions, olives, mint and feta. Add a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and the juice of your remaining lemon half. Gently mix it all together then have a taste to check the balance of flavours., To check your fish is cooked go to the thickest part of the flesh and it should pinch away easily, you’ll also be able to cleanly pull the bone away. Pile the couscous on a board or on your plates and top with the sardines. Dollop a bit of yoghurt on the side topped with some of that fiery harissa sauce. Pop the rocket on the side, squeeze a little of the caramelised lemon over each portion and tuck in."
