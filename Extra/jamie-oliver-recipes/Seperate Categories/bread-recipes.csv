Sarit & Itamar's mushroom sfiha | Jamie Oliver recipes,With caramelised onions & ricotta,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/153135556.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In35 minutes,,,,,,,,,,"3 onions, 500g mushrooms, 2 tablespoons Baharat seasoning, 1 large flatbread, 250g ricotta, PANTRY, olive oil, black pepper, sea salt, extra virgin olive oil","Peel and dice the onions, then sauté in a pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt on a medium heat so they soften – about 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, thickly slice the mushrooms., Once the onions start to stick to the bottom of the pan, add the sliced mushrooms – they will start to let out water and after about 10 to 12 minutes the volume should halve and there should be no liquid left in the pan., Add the baharat, then taste and adjust seasoning, if needed., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Line a 20cm cake or pie tin (or adjust to the size of your flatbread) with greaseproof paper., Quickly run the flatbread under a lightly running warm tap, drizzle lightly with oil, then press it down into the tin, so that the edges overhang the sides., Fill the base with ricotta, keeping 4 teaspoons back to serve, and spread out to create an even layer., Top with the mushroom filling, fold the overhanging sides of the flatbread down onto the filling and brush the exposed bread with a little olive oil., Bake in the centre of the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, then allow to sit for 5 minutes in the tin, before using the greaseproof to help you remove it easily., Slice up and serve hot with a dollop of seasoned ricotta. Great with a green salad."

Add the softened butter to the mix and pulse until combined., Lay out an A4 sheet of greaseproof paper on a baking tray, then use a spatula to evenly spread one third of the flavoured butter across the sheet, then sprinkle over the dried chilli. Lay another A4 sheet of greaseproof on top, then carefully place it in the freezer. Spoon the remaining butter onto another sheet of greaseproof, roll it up into a log and twist the ends like a Christmas cracker, then pop into the freezer for a rainy day (see the tip below)., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. When the time’s up on the bread, brush all over with a little olive oil, then bake for 30 minutes, or until golden and risen., Remove the garlic butter sheet from the freezer, peel back both sheets of paper and place it on top of the baked rolls, allowing it to slowly melt over each one, then let everyone tear off their own pieces – heaven!"

Allow it to prove for about an hour or an hour and 30 minutes, or until doubled in size – ideally in a warm, draught-free place., Once the dough has doubled in size, knock the air out by punching it with your fist, then kneading for 30 seconds., You can now shape it or flavour it as required – folded, filled, traybaked, whatever – and leave it to prove for a second time, for 30 minutes to an hour, or until it has doubled in size once more., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Carefully transfer your bread dough to the oven and gently close the door. Bake for about 35 minutes, or until golden. You can tell if it’s cooked by tapping its bottom – if it sounds hollow it’s done; if it doesn’t then pop it back in for a little longer., Once cooked, place your loaf on a cooling rack and allow to cool."

This is a normal thing to do, so just be confident!, Pick and finely chop the basil and dill and mix into the tomatoes., Season the fish fillets, then dip them in a little flour to dust them on both sides, shaking off any excess., Drizzle a glug of olive oil into a frying pan over a medium-high heat and, once hot, place the fish skin-side down in the pan, lightly pressing the fillets down using a fish slice., Fry the fish for 3 minutes, or until the skin is bright orangey golden and crisp. Turn the fish over and fry for 1 minute on the other side, or until just cooked. Remove the fish to a plate while you make the crispy breadcrumbs., Drizzle a little olive oil to the juices in the pan, then strip in the thyme leaves, add the breadcrumbs, crumble up the chilli and finely grate in the lemon zest. Toss around and fry  for 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly golden and crispy., Divide the tomato salad between four plates and either lay 2 fish fillets over the top of each salad, or break the fillets up and scatter over the tomatoes. I like to put the hot and crispy breadcrumbs in a little bowl with a teaspoon in them and sprinkle it over my guests’ plates at the table – delicious."

As soon as the focaccia comes out of the oven, feed it with a good drizzle of your very best extra virgin olive oil and a light scattering of sea salt. You can eat the focaccia as soon as it has cooled slightly."

With one hand, make a well in the centre. (If possible, it is preferable to warm the flour and semolina flour.), Pour all the dissolved yeast mixture into the centre and with four fingers of one hand make circular movements, from the centre working outwards, slowly bringing in the dry ingredients until all the yeast mixture is soaked up. Pour another 300ml of tepid water into the centre and gradually incorporate all the flour to make a dough. (Certain flours may need a little more water, so don’t be afraid to adjust the quantities.), Kneading! This is the best bit, just rolling, pushing and folding the dough over and over for 5 minutes. This develops the structure of the dough and the gluten. If any of the dough sticks to your hands, just rub them together with a little extra flour., Flour both your hands now, and lightly flour the top of the dough. Make it into a roundish shape and place on a baking tray. Score the dough with a knife – this allows it to relax and prove more quickly., Leave the bread to prove for the first time. Basically we want it to double in size. You want a warm, draught-free place for the quickest prove, for example near the cooker, in the airing cupboard, in the plate warmer of a cooker or just in a warm room, and you can cover it with a clean damp tea towel. This proving process matures the flour flavour and should take approximately 40 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, depending on the conditions., Right, it’s double the size and time to knock it back. Knead and punch the dough, knocking all the air out of it, for about a minute., Shape the dough into whatever shape you want – round, flat, filled, or whatever – and leave to prove a second time in a warm place until the dough is double its size. Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7., Now it’s time to cook your loaf. After all your hard work, don’t spoil your efforts. You want to keep the air inside the loaf, so don’t knock it, put it very gently into the oven and don’t slam the door., Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it’s cooked. You can tell if it’s cooked by tapping its bottom (if it’s in a tin you’ll have to take it out) – if it sounds hollow it’s cooked; if it doesn’t, pop it back in for a little longer., Place the bread on a wire rack to cool. You’re going to love this bread!"

Gradually pour in 500ml of tepid water and pulse for a few minutes until you have a ball of dough. Leave the lid on and prove in a warm place for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until doubled in size., Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper and dust with flour. Lightly draw the outline of a Christmas tree in the flour with your finger. Remove the box base from one Camembert and place it in the centre of the tray., Divide the dough into three pieces, then each of those into 12, giving you 36 in total. One-by-one roll each piece into a ball and place on the tray, building out from the Camembert box to create your tree shape. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove for another hour., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Cut the rind off the top of each Camembert leaving a 1cm rim (reserving the boxes for baking). Pick the tips off three rosemary sprigs and poke into the soft cheeses, then peel and finely slice the garlic, drizzle with olive oil and poke those in too. Sprinkle each cheese with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then pop one in its box in the centre of the tree, and another on a separate tray. Reserve the third cheese for later., Strip the remaining rosemary leaves and dot between the dough balls. Sprinkle with a good pinch of salt from a height, and drizzle with olive oil. Place the bread tree in the oven with the second cheese on the shelf below and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the Camemberts are gooey and the bread is risen and golden. As soon as you serve the first two cheeses, bake the third one in its box for about 20 minutes, then swap with the eaten ones. Delicious."

Next, pour in 1½ tablespoons of oil and 350ml water into the well and add most of the beaten egg (saving a little for egg washing later). Mix with a fork, then bring together with your hands to form a ball., On a lightly dusted surface, knead the dough for 10 minutes until smooth and springy. Be careful not to add too much flour here to prevent the dough drying out., Place in a large oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size., To braid your challah, divide the dough into two balls. Put one aside covered with a damp tea towel and cut the other ball into 4 even pieces.  Roll each piece into a thin sausage-shape, roughly 60cm long., Place two of the strands next to each other vertically. Weave the remaining two strands horizontally over and under the vertical strands to form a cross shape., Working with the top pair of strands, take the strand that is underneath and place over the strand next to it. Do the same with the next pair of strands and continue this around the cross. Once all four pairs have been crossed over, do the same in the reverse direction – clockwise/anti-clockwise depending on your strands. The rule to go by is to always place the underneath strand over its pair., Continue this process until you have used up the dough. As you start to run out of dough tuck the ends under the loaf to form a neat braided ball. Place on a lined baking tray., Repeat the braiding technique with your second ball of dough., Cover both loaves loosely with a damp tea towel and leave to rise for a further 30 minutes. Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Use the remaining egg to glaze the challah. Sprinkle over the sesame seeds and bake for 40 minutes, or until golden. Adding extra egg wash halfway, if needed."

Place on a lightly oiled tray, and cover with a clean damp tea towel until you’re ready to cook., Working in batches, drizzle a little oil into a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with some of the butter.

Place in a greased bowl, cover and leave to rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size., Returning to the filling, drain the dried fruit and add to a bowl. Finely grate in the lemon zest, finely chop the hazelnuts and add along with rest of the filling ingredients, rubbing together with your fingers. Cover and set aside., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a 28cm x 70cm rectangle. Spread the filling over the dough, leaving a 3cm border all the way around., Roll the dough up from one of the longer ends, pressing the edge firmly to seal. Cut the roll in half lengthways, turn the pieces cut-side-up, then loosely twist around each other., Bring the ends together into a ring, tuck one under the other, and press to seal. Transfer the wreath to a baking tray, cover with a clean tea towel and set aside for 30 minutes, or until increased by half its size., Bake in the middle of the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.

Combine the levain ingredients in a bowl with 80g of water and beat until smooth. Cover with clingfilm and leave overnight, at room temperature, until the mixture is bubbly., The next morning, combine the strong white flour and rye or spelt flour in a large bowl, and make a well in the centre. Add the levain and 300ml of cool water., Mix with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon for a couple of minutes until thoroughly combined and no lumps remain. Cover and set aside for 20 to 30 minutes to let the flour absorb the water and become hydrated., Grind 15g sea salt in a pestle and mortar and add to the dough. Using wet hands, mix to combine, then turn out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10 minutes using the ‘slap and fold’ technique: pick up the dough in both hands, flip it and slap it onto the work surface, letting the full weight of it drop – the dough will stick to the surface. Working quickly, pull and stretch the dough from the far end towards you, then fold it in half away from you. Pick up the dough again, turn it anti-clockwise, and repeat. Continue this action for 10 to 15 minutes – the dough will be silky smooth, elastic and no longer sticky. Do not be tempted to add more flour during the kneading process., With the help of the bench scraper, scoop the dough up and return it to the bowl, rounded-side-up. Cover loosely with clingfilm or a shower cap and leave at room temperature, in a draught-free spot, for about 1 hour, or until the dough looks smooth and airy but has not risen significantly., Lightly dust your hands and work surface with flour. Turn out the dough, gently press and stretch it into a rectangle three times as long as it is wide, about 12cm x 40cm., With a shorter side closest to you, fold the lower third into the middle, then fold the upper third over the top, giving you a triple-layered square of dough. Rotate it 90 degrees, stretch it out into a rectangle again and repeat the folding steps once more., Flip the square of dough over, place it back in the bowl and cover loosely with clingfilm or a shower cap. Leave to prove at room temperature for 4 hours., Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Pull the top edge into the centre, turn the dough a quarter of a turn and repeat – do this 5 or 6 times until it becomes smooth. Flip it over, cover with an upturned bowl and set aside for 10 to 15 minutes., Place the rice flour in a bowl with an extra tablespoon of strong flour. Line a banneton or proving basket with a clean linen towel and dust with the flour mixture – this ensures that the dough won’t stick to the sides of the basket., Use the palms of your hands to shape the dough into a tight round, seam-side down. Twist the dough anti-clockwise, without lifting it or knocking out any air – you want to keep the ball neat and tight. Dust with flour and use the bench scraper to lift and turn it over., Place in the basket, seam-side-up, cover with a shower cap and leave to prove at room temperature for 4 hours, by which time it will have risen by nearly half again., Place the basket of dough in the fridge overnight to prove. The next morning, the dough should be almost to the top of the basket and, when pressed with the tip of your finger, will slowly bounce back, leaving a small indent., Preheat the oven to 240ºC/475ºF/gas 9 and place a cloche baking dome, Dutch oven or large, lidded cast-iron casserole dish inside. Leave the oven to heat up for 30 minutes or so., Remove the dough from the fridge, dust with semolina or polenta and carefully turn out the loaf into the cloche or casserole. Working quickly, use a lame to slash a pattern into the top of the loaf.

You’ll get two loaves so you can freeze one, after baking, to eat another time.  ”",387,14.8g,11.3g,3.7g,,10.7g,48.6g,,"1 x 7                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                sachet dried yeast, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                runny honey, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ripe banana, 1                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range egg, 800                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                strong bread flour                                                                                                                                                                , plus extra for dusting, 1                                                                                                                                                                400ml tin                                                                                                                                                                light coconut milk, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                desiccated coconut, unsalted butter                                                                                                                                                                , for greasing","Stir the yeast and honey into 200ml of tepid water, then leave for a couple of minutes to bubble up a bit., Peel and mash the banana. Crack the egg into a bowl and beat together., It’s best to use a stand mixer for this. Put the flour, mashed banana, beaten egg, coconut milk, coconut and a small pinch of sea salt in the bowl and combine using the dough hook., Add the yeast mixture and let the mixer run for 15 minutes. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and let prove for 1 hour., If working by hand, combine the wet ingredients in a bowl. Mix the coconut, flour and salt in a separate bowl, make a well in the centre, then tip in the wet ingredients and yeast and pull together, using your fingers then hands, until well combined., Turn out onto a clean surface dusted with flour. Add a little extra flour, so it’s more manageable, then knead for at least 10 minutes, or until it’s elastic. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and let prove for 1 hour., Tip the dough onto a clean, floured surface. Knead for a few minutes and bring into a ball., Divide the dough into 2 pieces and push into 2 greased 13cm x 18cm loaf tins. Cover the tins with a damp tea towel and prove in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Cook the loaves for 30 to 35 minutes, or till the crusts are golden-brown, and sound hollow when tapped., Transfer to a wire rack to cool a little. Delicious served warm with chopped mango, fresh mint and yoghurt hit with lime zest and juice, and honey."

Continue to mix, bringing in all the flour., When the dough comes together and becomes too hard to mix with your fork, dust your hands with flour and begin to pat it into a ball., Knead the dough, using your left hand to stretch it towards you and, at the same time, your right hand to push it away from you. Repeat this for about 10 minutes, or until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough., Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with a piece of kitchen towel or clingfilm and leave for about 45 minutes, or until doubled in size., Pick and finely chop the parsley leaves and place in a bowl. Beat in the butter, then peel and finely grate in the garlic., Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, then wrap in greaseproof paper and place in the fridge to firm up a little., Line three baking sheets with greaseproof paper., Divide the proved dough into quarters, then divide each quarter into four and finally divide each one into roughly 80g pieces. Roll into balls and place on the baking sheets., Cover with a damp tea towel and allow to prove once more for 20 minutes, or until the pieces are slightly risen and joining together., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4, then bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until pale golden. The dough balls are ready when they sound hollow when tapped on the base., Leave to cool slightly, then serve and let people tear off chunks to dip into, or spread with, the herby butter."

6., Cut the tops from the garlic bulbs, exposing the cloves. Place on a 20cm square of tin foil, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, then wrap the foil around them., Place on a baking tray and cook for 45 minutes, or until very soft. Leave to cool slightly, then squeeze the garlic out of its skins., While you wait, grease and line a 1.2 litre loaf tin with parchment., Finely grate the Parmesan, drain and tear up the mozzarella, crumble the Stilton, and pick and tear the basil leaves., Mix the soft butter with all but 1 tablespoon of each cheese. Add in the basil, plus a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Set aside., Add the flour, yeast, baking powder, sugar and salt to a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the whole egg and egg white with the vinegar., Pour the eggs and 325ml warm water over the flour mixture, stirring with 
a wooden spoon until it forms a soft dough., Shape into a smooth ball, adding a little flour if needed, then set aside for 20 minutes to firm up., Divide the dough into four pieces, then roll or press each one into a rectangle about 20 x 10cm – you will need to use plenty of flour to stop the dough from sticking to both you and the worktop., Dot a third of the cheesy butter and a few garlic cloves over the first layer, repeat with other pieces of dough, very carefully layering them on top of each other. Finish with the last layer of dough., Cut the layered dough widthways into four, then turn each piece cut-side-up and place side by side in your tin. Cover loosely with oiled cling film and leave in a warm place until well risen, about 1 hour. The bread will rise further in the oven, so make sure the bread has filled the tin and feels pillowy before baking., Preheat the oven to 220C/gas 7., Scatter with the rest of the cheese, drizzle with a little oil, then bake for 45 minutes or until deep golden brown and sizzling. Eat warm, rather than hot, and on the day it’s made."

the flour, sugar and 1 teaspoon of sea salt in an electric mixer or another large bowl., Using your hands or the mixer’s dough hook on medium, work in the butter till the mix is like fine breadcrumbs., With a wooden spoon, stir in the caraway seeds (if using) and yeasty milk until well combined. It will appear a bit wet, but don’t add any flour. Rest the dough for 10 minutes., Skip this stage if using an electric mixer. Grab a handful of dough, stretch it out and slap it back into the bowl. Continue to stretch and slap for 5 minutes until it’s more elastic and easier to handle., Turn the dough out onto a flour-dusted work surface and, with floured hands, knead it for 8 to 10 minutes (or 6 to 8 minutes using the mixer’s dough hook) until it is smooth and elastic., Place the dough in a large clean bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until doubled in size., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/gas 5. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper (or use a non-stick baking tray)., Knock back the dough and turn it out onto a work surface. Divide into 12 equal pieces and roll into balls., Place them seam-side up and push a sugar cube into the centres. Pull the dough around it so it is completely enclosed. Reshape into balls., Place sugar-side down on the tray and cover with a damp cloth. Leave in a warm place for 30 minutes, or until doubled in size., Beat the egg, then brush over the buns. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden and sound hollow when tapped underneath., Just before you take them out the oven, warm the milk and sugar for the glaze until the sugar has dissolved., Transfer the buns to a wire rack and brush generously with the milk glaze while they’re still hot., Lightly crush the sugar cubes for the topping, then sprinkle on top with the caraway seeds (if using). Eat while warm."

beat the egg and juice the orange, then mix all the dough ingredients (except the milk) in a bowl, adding up to 75ml of milk little by little, until the mixture forms a smooth and relatively stiff dough., Let it rest for 15 minutes while you preheat the oven to 185ºC/gas 4½, then roll the dough out into a very long, thin rectangle, about ½cm thick, 50 to 60cm long and 10cm wide., For the filling, mix the sugar and spices together and sprinkle over the dough. Melt and drizzle the butter over, and make into a roll, rolling up from one short end to the other., Divide the dough up into 4 slices and place on a parchment-lined baking tray., Combine the glaze ingredients in a small pan over a medium heat and bring to the boil., Spoon a little glaze over the dough and bake for about 40 minutes, basting with more glaze a couple of times, until golden, risen and sticky. Your folar may spread a little, but will still be delicious."

tepid water and give it a good stir to combine. Leave it to one side to activate, when the surface will become foamy., Peel and finely chop the shallot., In a pan, heat the molasses, butter, coffee and chocolate with 500ml of water until the chocolate and butter have melted, then add the vinegar., For this step you can either use an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, or make the bread by hand. In your mixer or bowl, stir together all three flours, then scoop out about a third into a separate bowl and set aside. Mix the bran into your main flour, along with the caraway seeds, fennel seeds, 2 tablespoons of sea salt and shallot, then pour in the chocolate and yeast mixtures. If you’re using a mixer, put it on medium speed and mix together until lovely and smooth, around 3 to 5 minutes, or beat it with a wooden spoon, although it’ll take a little longer by hand., Reduce the speed and add the remaining mixed flour a little at a time until it comes together in a dough. It should feel a little sticky, but firm and dense. You might not need all the flour., Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it well, so it becomes springy and elastic. Mould the dough into a ball with your hands., Lightly grease a clean mixing bowl and the dough ball with the olive oil. Pop the dough ball into the bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place for 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size., Now knock the dough back by turning it out onto a lightly floured surface and kneading for a couple of minutes. Cut the dough in two and form each half into a round loaf., Place them on a lightly greased baking tray, seam-side down, cover with a damp tea towel, and leave to rise again for about an hour., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., Slice a cross into the top of each loaf and place in the oven for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until browned on top  and cooked through – they’ll sound hollow when knocked on the bottom., Delicious serve with soft butter and, ideally, a selection of caviar."

Line a 1.5-litre loaf tin with greaseproof paper., Fill a jug with 375ml of lukewarm water, add the yeast and oil, then mix with a fork until combined and leave aside for 5 minutes., Pile the flour, ground almonds and all the seeds into a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt and make a well in the middle. Pick, finely chop and add the rosemary leaves. Crack in the eggs, add the Marmite (if using – simply leave it out for a gluten-free friendly loaf) and beat together, then pour in the yeast mixture., Whisking as you go, gradually bring in the flour from the outside until combined – it’ll be more like a batter than a dough. Pour into the prepared tin and smooth out nice and evenly on top., Now you’ve got two choices – bake it straight away and it’ll puff up a bit more and taste fantastic, or cover and place it in the fridge overnight and allow some slightly more complex sour flavours to develop. Both are brilliant, just different., To bake, place in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden, cooked through and an inserted skewer comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for at least 20 minutes before eating, then serve., This bread is good fresh for a couple of days, and delicious toasted for a few days after that. You could even use any leftovers to make croutons., TOPPING IDEAS GALORE – these suggestions are all about giving you loads of colourful inspiration for tasty topping combos that’ll fill you with goodness – choose your favourites and tuck in:

Line a 25cm ovenproof frying pan or tin with a scrunched sheet of wet greaseproof paper., Place 200g of figs in a food processor with the oil, yoghurt, vanilla extract, peeled bananas and eggs, then blitz until smooth., Add the flour, baking powder, ground almonds, poppy seeds and turmeric and pulse until just combined, but don’t overwork the mixture., Coarsely grate and stir in the apple., Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan and spread out evenly., Tear over the remaining figs, pushing them in slightly, then chop the almonds and scatter over., Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden, cooked through and an inserted skewer comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack to cool a little., I like to serve each portion with 1 tablespoon of nut butter, 1 tablespoon of natural yoghurt and some wedges of blood orange., Store any extra portions in an airtight container, where it will keep for 2 to 3 days."

      demerara sugar","Start by making the brioche. In the bowl of a free-standing mixer, combine the salt, sugar, yeast, 6 eggs, both flours and 85ml of tepid water. Using the dough-hook attachment, mix on a slow speed until all the ingredients are combined; this should take about 3 minutes., Increase the mixer speed to just over halfway and mix until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl. Turn off the mixer and leave the mixture to rest for 5 minutes., Turn the mixer back on and slowly add the butter, a little nugget at a time, until all of it is incorporated. Add a little more flour if the dough feels too sticky – it should come away easily from the sides of the bowl., Place the dough in a separate, lightly oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to prove at room temperature until doubled in size, about 40 minutes., Once it’s proved, knock back the dough by folding it onto itself. Cover and place in the fridge for 4 hours., Next, make your shortbread. Cream the butter, sugar and vanilla until smooth and fluffy. Mix in the flour, until it comes together into a dough., Place between two sheets of greaseproof paper and roll it out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Using star-shaped cutters (or any shape you like), cut out 24 biscuits., Chill on a lined baking tray in the fridge for at least 10 minutes, until ready to bake., Preheat the oven to 160ºC/gas 2–3, then bake the shortbread for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden. Sprinkle with caster sugar, then set aside., To make your crème pâtissière, place the milk, cream and cinnamon into a pan over a medium heat. While that’s heating, whisk the eggs, sugar and cornflour in a bowl., Once the cream mixture has almost come to a boil, take it off the heat. Slowly pour a third of it into the eggs, whisking constantly – this step will gently bring up the temperature of the eggs without scrambling them., Pour the mixture back into the rest of the cream mixture and whisk well. Place the pan back over the heat and whisk the mixture constantly until it starts to boil – this will take about 2 to 3 minutes., Pour into a clean bowl and place a sheet of clingfilm on the surface of your crème pat, to stop a skin from forming. Leave the bowl in the fridge until needed., Once the brioche has chilled for 4 hours, divide into 40 to 50g balls, roughly the size of golf balls, and place on a baking tray lined with baking paper. Cover loosely with clingfilm and leave to prove again until doubled in size, about 25 minutes., Preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4., In a bowl, combine all of the crumble ingredients and rub together with your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Set aside., With lightly floured hands, poke an indent in the centre of each ball, then lift each one and gently pull the sides away to make a doughnut shape, being careful not to knock out too much air., Place the brioches on the baking sheet. Use two fingers to gently increase each indent into a crater 3 to 4cm wide., Working quickly, place a teaspoonful of crème pâtissière into the centre, topped with a couple of teaspoons of mincemeat., Beat the remaining eggs together, then glaze the outside of the pies with egg wash, and top generously with the crumble mixture., Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown, then remove from the oven and leave to cool., Press the shortbread shapes on top of your mince pies, and serve."

makes it easier to grease, especially if it’s non-stick., Brush the chilled tin with melted butter, ensuring every little groove is coated. Dust with 1 tablespoon of the flour and tap out the excess., Finely chop the candied peel, then place in a small saucepan with the raisins., Add the brandy and orange blossom water (if using), then set it over a low heat until warm, but do not let it boil. Remove from the heat, stir well and set aside until the fruit has soaked up all of the liquid., Meanwhile, to make your dough, tip the yeast into the bowl of a free-standing mixer., Remove the seeds from the cardamom pods, then grind to a powder in a pestle and mortar (roughly ¼ of a teaspoon)., In a pan, heat the milk until just warm and add to the yeast with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Whisk well to combine, then leave for about 10 minutes, until the yeast has formed a thick, foamy crust on top of the milk., Add the remaining sugar, plain flour, ground cardamom, cinnamon and a grating of nutmeg, and ½ teaspoon of sea salt., Whisk the buttermilk with the whole eggs and egg yolk, finely grate in the lemon zest and add the vanilla, then add to the bowl., Add the butter, then, using the dough hook, start mixing the dough on a slow speed until combined. Continue to mix for a further 3 to 4 minutes until silky smooth., Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size., Scatter the whole almonds into the bottom of the prepared tin., Tip the soaked fruit into the dough and mix again until combined. Spoon the dough evenly into the tin over the nuts, spread level, cover with clingfilm and leave to rise again until almost doubled in size; this will take 45 minutes to 1 hour., Preheat the oven to 170ºC/gas 3 and position the rack in the bottom third., Bake the kugelhopf for 45 to 50 minutes until golden brown, well risen and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean., Sit the tin on a wire rack for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn the kugelhopf out of the tin and leave to cool, upright, until completely cold., Dust liberally with icing sugar to serve."

candied peel, and quarter the glacé cherries. Finely grate the orange zest., Place all of the dried fruit into a bowl with the orange zest. Squeeze the orange juice into a pan, add the brandy or rum and heat to just below boiling point, then pour it over the dried fruit. Mix well, then set aside for 1 to 2 hours to allow it to plump up., Remove the seeds from the cardamom pods, then grind to a powder in a pestle and mortar (roughly ¼ of a teaspoon)., Spoon the yeast into the bowl of a free-standing mixer, then add the sugar., In a pan, heat the milk until just warm, add to the yeast and whisk to combine. Set aside for 5 to 10 minutes, until the yeast has formed a thick, foamy crust on the milk., Add the flour, spices and ½ teaspoon of sea salt. Using a dough hook, combine the butter, egg and vanilla, then mix for 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic., Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour. Line a baking sheet with baking paper and set aside., Roughly chop the almonds and pistachios., Pour away about half the liquid from the soaked fruit, then add the fruit and remaining liquid to the dough, along with the nuts. Mix again., Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead lightly for 1 minute. Shape the dough into an oval shape, about A4 size., Roll the marzipan into a neat log, about 4cm shorter than the length 
of the dough, and place in the middle of the oval., Brush one long edge of the dough with milk and fold it over, completely encasing the marzipan, and press the edges together to seal., Carefully lift the dough onto the baking sheet, cover loosely with oiled clingfilm and leave to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until nearly doubled in size., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., Remove the clingfilm, then bake the stollen for 30 minutes, or until golden, risen and the underside sounds slightly hollow when tapped., Leave to cool on a wire rack before dredging with icing sugar to serve."

chopping board, carefully halve the rolls across the middle using a bread knife, to give you a top and a base for each. Put to one side., Using an eating knife, cut each radish in half lengthways, then slice each radish half into 3 pieces and place into a large bowl., Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, scoop out the watery seeds with a teaspoon and discard. Slice each cucumber half into 4 pieces, then add to the bowl., Trim the carrot, then cut into 8 even-sized pieces and add to the bowl., Click apart the cauliflower florets and place into the bowl with the stalks., Pull out the pepper’s stalk, tearing out the core, then discard. Scoop out the seeds and white pith with a teaspoon, then discard. Cut the pepper into 4 slices, then cut each slice into 4 pieces. Add the pieces to the bowl., Remove the core from the apple half and place, flat-side down, on the board. Cut it into 6 even-sized pieces, then add to the bowl., Place a clean tea towel onto the chopping board and place the vegetables and chopped apple in a pile in the middle., Fold over each corner of the tea towel so your ingredients are wrapped up like a parcel – make sure there are no gaps to stop the vegetables from escaping., Carefully crush and squash the vegetables with a rolling pin until broken down into little pieces. Open up the parcel – if your pieces are still too big, wrap it back up and crush and squash again., Measure the balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil into the empty bowl to make your dressing., Pick the herb leaves, discarding the stalks. Tear the leaves into small pieces, adding them to the bowl as you go., Using scissors, snip the cress or sprouting herbs into the bowl, then add the peas and sunflower seeds., Add the squashed vegetables to the bowl, then using the tips of your fingers, carefully toss them in the dressing so they’re nicely coated., Spread the base of each roll with the cottage or cream cheese, then spread the soft side of each top with the houmous., Divide the vegetable mixture equally between the base of each roll. Place the lids on top, houmous-side down, press lightly, then tuck in!, Jamie's top tip: When beetroot is in season, I like to add it here for extra colour and flavour. Feel free to swap in your own favourite seasonal veg – just make sure it has a bit of crunch!"

Meanwhile, combine the flour and ½ tablespoon of sea salt in a large bowl and make a well in the middle., Pour 1 tablespoon of the melted ghee into the well, followed by the yoghurt and yeast mixture, then beat the wet ingredients together with a fork. Gradually start incorporating the flour from the sides until it starts to form a rough dough, then bring it together with your hands – it should be soft and sticky, so add a splash more water, if you think it needs it., Knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for around 5 minutes, or until smooth, then place into a lightly floured bowl., Cover with a clean tea towel and leave in a warm place for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until doubled in size., Once risen, knock back the dough with your fist, then divide into 6 balls. Roll each portion into an oval shape, roughly 1½cm thick., Heat a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat, add a naan bread and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until cooked through, turning halfway., Brush with a little of the remaining ghee, sprinkle over a few nigella seeds and a small pinch of salt. Keep warm in the oven while you make the remaining breads. Delicious served with your favourite curry."

Use your hands to flatten the dough slightly so you end up with a disk, roughly 6 to 7cm thick., Score a cross into the top of the bread with the blunt edge of a knife, then bake in the centre of the oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a firm crust has formed and it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom., Turn the bread out onto a wire rack to cool, then serve slightly warm with some soup or a nice wedge of cheese."

Gradually pour in 550ml of tepid water, continuously stirring and bringing in the flour from the outside as you go to form a rough dough., Transfer to a flour-dusted surface and knead for 10 minutes, or until smooth and springy. Place in a bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and prove in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size., Meanwhile, make the butter – this is a big batch, to make good use of your time, and you can freeze the extra for rainy days. Use a garlic crusher to crush the garlic into the softened butter, finely grate over the zest of ½ a lemon, finely chop and add the parsley (stalks and all), the cayenne and a pinch of salt, then mix it all together., Remove one quarter to use in this recipe, then place the rest on a sheet of greaseproof paper, roll it up into a log and twist the ends like a Christmas cracker, then pop into the freezer., After 30 minutes, get the butter out and slice it up to pre-portion, then re-roll and return to the freezer, where it will keep very happily for up to 6 months., Spread one third of your soft butter portion all around the base and sides of a large metal tray (25cm x 35cm), then scatter in the breadcrumbs and shake around into an even layer so they stick to the butter., Divide up the dough into 35 pieces, then, one-by-one, roll each one into a ball and place in the tray in rows – 5 balls across and 7 balls long is perfect., Bomb over another third of the soft butter, in and around the balls. Leave to prove for another 1 hour 30 minutes, or until doubled in size again., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Sprinkle the balls with a little salt, then bake on the bottom shelf of the oven for 30 minutes, or until lovely and golden., Bomb over that final third of your soft butter and spread it around to give the bread a beautiful shine., Whack the tray in the middle of the table or at the centre of your picnic for sharing, and let everyone tear off their own pieces."

Combine the margarine, cinnamon, ginger and orange zest in a bowl. Use a small amount to grease a medium ovenproof dish (roughly 20cm x 25cm), then spread the remaining margarine onto the bread., Halve the bread slices diagonally, then place roughly a third into the dish in a single layer. Roughly chop the apricots, then scatter a third into the dish along with a third of the sultanas. Cover with another layer of bread, scatter with more dried fruit, then cover with the remaining bread. Set aside, reserving the remaining dried fruit for later., To make the custard, halve the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape out the seeds. Add the seeds to a medium pan with the remaining custard ingredients and 400ml of water. Whisk well until smooth and combined, then place over a medium–low heat. Simmer gently for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the custard is almost boiling and coats the back of a wooden spoon, whisking continuously., Pour the custard over the bread then scatter the remaining dried fruit on top. Leave to soak for around 20 minutes, then place in the hot oven for 25 to 35 minutes, or until lightly golden and starting to set., Meanwhile, gently warm the marmalade in a pan over a low heat. Once the pudding is ready, brush over the warm marmalade, then return to the oven for a further 5 minutes, or until golden and sticky. Allow to cool slightly, then tuck in."

Dissolve the yeast in the milk with 2 tablespoons of warm water. Whisk together, then leave for 15 minutes, or until frothy., Sift the flour, mixed spice and 1 teaspoon of sea salt into a separate bowl. Tip 150g of it into another bowl, along with 1 tablespoon each of the sugar and the yeast liquid. Mix to a smooth paste and leave to rise for 15 minutes., When the batter has risen, slowly incorporate small pieces of the butter. Once it is all mixed in, beat the eggs and pour in, then grate in the zest of the orange and stir to combine. Add the rest of the flour and caster sugar and mix well., Once all the flour is combined, turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead vigorously for 20 minutes until smooth and no longer sticky (you may prefer to do this in a free-standing mixer with a dough hook, if you have one). Form into a ball, place in a lightly oiled bowl and leave to rise for 1 to 1½ hours, until doubled in size., Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knock it back by kneading lightly. Divide into 4 and roll each piece into a long sausage. Cut each one in half, then each half into thirds, to give you 24 pieces., Roll each piece into a ball and pierce a hole in the middle with your thumb. Pop them on a tray lined with greaseproof paper and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size., Fill a deep saucepan two-thirds full with vegetable oil and place over a medium heat, until it reaches 160°C (if you don’t have a thermometer, drop in a piece of bread – when it sizzles and turns brown the oil is ready). Stretch the doughnuts back into a ring, then fry them, in batches, for 1 minute on each side, or until golden. Then leave to drain on kitchen paper., To decorate your doughnuts, roll them in caster sugar or drizzle with melted chocolate and roughly chop freeze-dried berries to sprinkle over. Make a glaze by sieving the icing sugar and whisking in a little water, then brush this over your doughnuts."

Lightly oil a 20cm x 30cm baking tray., When the dough has doubled in size, which should take about 30 minutes, tip it back onto the floured work surface and knead again briefly, adding flour if it’s a little too sticky., Rub a rolling pin with flour and roll the dough to form a 30cm x 20cm rectangle. Using the rolling pin, lift the dough and unroll it over the tray, dropping it neatly into place. Leave to prove for another 30 minutes., When the focaccia has risen again slightly, push the chestnuts and rosemary springs into the dough., Cut the pancetta into 5cm lengths and lay it on top, so it can crisp up in the oven.

Warm the milk in a small pan over a low heat, then leave to cool slightly. Crack the eggs into a large bowl, add the vinegar, then gradually stir in the warm milk until combined., Combine the flour, salt, sugar and yeast in another bowl, then, using a wooden spoon, stir the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until it forms a sticky dough. Add the olive oil, then bring it together with your hands into a ball, adding a little flour if it’s too sticky., Place onto a lightly oiled baking tray, cover with a damp tea towel, then leave to prove in a warm place for around 1 hour, or until doubled in size., Once risen, place the tray in the hot oven and bake for around 35 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. Leave to cool slightly on a wire cooling rack, then slice and serve. Delicious with hearty stews and soups, or toasted and served hot with butter and jam."

place over a low heat for a few minutes, or until slightly warm – you should be able to dip your finger in without scalding it., Add the butter to a separate pan and place over a low heat for a few minutes, or until melted, then set aside., Transfer the warmed milk mixture to a medium bowl and stir in the yeast., Sift the flour into a large bowl, then add 1 teaspoon of sea salt, the spices, a few good scrapings of nutmeg and the sugar. Finely chop the stem ginger and stir it into the mix., Make a well in the centre and pour in the melted butter, followed by the yeast mixture. In a separate bowl, beat the egg and add it to the bowl., Using a fork, mix well until you have a rough dough, then transfer to a clean flour dusted work surface and knead for around 10 minutes, or until soft and springy., Return the dough to a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for at least an hour, or until doubled in size., Transfer the dough to a clean flour dusted work surface. Knock the air out by bashing it with your fist, then sprinkle over the dried fruit and mixed peel and knead into the dough for 1 to 2 minutes., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/Gas 5. Grease and line a large baking tray., Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and roll each into a ball, evenly spacing them out on the tray as you go., Cover with the tea towel and leave in a warm place for a further 30 minutes, or until doubled in size., Place the plain flour and 2 tablespoons water into a small bowl and mix to a thick paste., Gently pat down the risen buns then use the batter to carefully trace a cross over the top with a piping bag or spoon., Place the buns into the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown., Transfer to a wire cooling rack, brush over a little honey to glaze, then leave to cool., Slice open the sticky hot cross buns, spread with a little butter and serve – delicious"

They can be whizzed together quickly, then poured into a Yorkshire pudding mould and banged into the oven to get lovely and crisp on the top and bottom, and knotty, chewy and bubbly inside. They’re perfect with butter, or whatever other lovely condiments you’ve got hanging around the cupboard. My wife loves strawberry jam with hers, Daisy loves Marmite, Poppy loves a drizzle of honey, and personally I like a little scrambled egg with a blob of ketchup or brown sauce (or both) on the plate and, depending on how I feel, a little chilli sauce., Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3 and grease a 12-hole muffin tin with some vegetable oil. Place all the other ingredients in a bowl with 2 teaspoons of sea salt and pour in 600ml of tepid water. The water needs to be warm enough to activate the yeast, but not so hot that it kills it., Whisk everything together until you’ve got a loose batter that is just combined – this should only take a few seconds. Leave to stand for 10 minutes to let the yeast do its job. When the mixture is a spoonable, sticky consistency, but still quite wet, spoon it into the muffin tin. Fill each hole until it’s almost level with the top of the tin and cook for around 35 minutes, or until the crumpies are risen and golden. Remove to a wire rack for a few minutes to cool slightly, then serve while still warm with anything you fancy., Here are a few ideas to get your started:, Cream cheese
Jam and banana
A few slices of cooked ham
Some beautiful slices of cheese
Smoked salmon and a wedge of lemon
Sliced strawberries with cream or yoghurt
Some snapped up pieces of crispy bacon
A spoonful of quality jam
Sliced banana and runny honey
A spoonful of nutella
Ham and mustard
A poached egg
... but there are no rules!"

                higher-welfare pancetta","Until recently, I’d always seen this type of pizza as a slightly greedy way of bulking out crusts and toppings. I hadn’t realized Italian immigrants had cleverly adapted their old-world recipes to suit new-world coalfired ovens. Making pizzas in tins to protect the base from the soot of the oven makes perfect sense to me now, and I can honestly say that when it’s cooked and seasoned with proper love and care, I’m more than happy with this representative of the pizza family., To make your dough, pour 650ml of lukewarm water into a large bowl and use a fork to stir in the yeast, sugar and 1 level teaspoon of fine sea salt. Add your flour, bit by bit, until it comes together. You want smooth springy dough, so keep adding a bit more flour if necessary. Dust a clean surface with flour, then knead the dough with your hands. When you’re happy with the consistency, pop it into a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm room until the dough has almost doubled in size., Meanwhile, put a lug of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat. Add your sliced onions and thyme leaves and cook for 15 minutes, or until softened and golden. Take the pan off the heat and put aside. Put all the tomato sauce ingredients into a food processor or liquidizer with a good pinch of salt and black pepper and blitz to a purée. Have a taste and season carefully, adding a bit more salt and pepper if it needs it., Slit the sausages open and squeeze the meat into a bowl. Bash up the dried chilli and fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar, add these to the meat with the dried oregano and mix well with a fork., Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Divide the dough in half and oil 2 trays (about 25 x 35cm) with olive oil. Use a rolling pin or clean hands to flatten and stretch the dough out. Roll or push the dough around each tray and really push it into the corners so you get a chubby crust and a base about 1cm thick., Divide your blitzed tomato sauce between the pizzas and spread around. Scatter over the caramelized onions and dot small pinches of the sausage mixture around the top of each pizza. Tear up the mozzarella and dot the pieces over the sausage, then sprinkle over the fresh basil leaves, sliced fresh chilli, a good pinch of salt and pepper and the grated Parmesan. Finally let your slices of pancetta sort of fall on to the pizzas so they curl and crisp up as they cook. Place in the bottom of the oven for about 20 minutes so the base gets nice and crispy while the top is cooking. Once your pizzas are beautifully cooked, serve right away with a fresh green lemony salad."

You get incredible flavour from the onions and sweetcorn, while the cornmeal gives it a rustic, spongy texture that’s so brilliant. Two of my favourites, chilli and cheese, do their thing in this bread and really take the flavour to a whole other level. You can serve this cornbread alongside soups or stews, but frankly, I think a good slice of this, with a bit of crunchy salad, makes a brilliant lunch. You could also reheat it in a dry pan the next day for breakfast and eat it with poached eggs and some smoky bacon . . . totally delicious., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Grease a 22cm cake tin with oil and line the base with greaseproof paper., Peel and finely slice the onions. Melt the butter in a frying pan on a medium heat, add the onions, then fry gently for 15 to 20 minutes, or until caramelised, golden and sticky., Hold the corn cobs upright on a board and carefully run a small knife from the top of the corn to the bottom, cutting all the kernels off., Add to the caramelised onions and cook for a further 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool., Beat the eggs in a large bowl, then mix in the cornmeal, milk, baking powder, flour and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Grate the cheese, add most of it to the bowl, then beat until well mixed. Deseed, finely chop and stir in 2 chillies, along with the cooled onion and corn mixture., Pour the mixture into the prepared cake tin. Finely slice and sprinkle over the remaining chilli, then pop the cornbread into the oven for 35 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. About 10 minutes before it’s ready, sprinkle over your remaining cheese and return it to the oven., Cool for 15 minutes, then turn it out onto a wire rack or serving plate, cheesy side up.

Leave aside in a warm place for around 30 minutes – this helps to dry it out., Place the tomatoes in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Rinse the capers, squeezing out any excess liquid and add to the bowl, along with the onion, peppers, ciabatta and anchovies, if using. Toss the mixture together with your hands, then stir in 2 tablespoons of vinegar and about 3 times as much extra virgin olive oil. Taste and add a little more salt, pepper, vinegar or oil, if needed., Tear in the basil leaves, stir together and serve. Delicious with barbecued meats or roast chicken."

Stir to combine and make a well in the middle. Gradually pour 650ml of lukewarm water into the well, continuously stirring and bringing in the flour as you go to form a rough dough., Transfer the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead for around 10 minutes, or until smooth and springy. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for around 1 hour, or until doubled in size., Meanwhile, lightly grease a large baking tray. Once the dough has risen, knock it back with your fist and place on the oiled baking tray. Using your hands, spread it out to cover the tray, then drizzle with olive oil. Use your fingers to push down into the dough to make lots of little wells and dips., Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Add the Jersey Royals to a medium pan of boiling salted water, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until cooked through. Drain and leave to cool in a colander. Meanwhile, finely slice the purple potatoes with a mandolin (use the guard!) and add to a bowl with the rosemary leaves., Separate and lightly crush the garlic cloves, then add to the bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and toss to combine. Evenly spread the potato mixture over the dough, crumble over the cooled Jersey Royals, drizzle with a little more olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cover with a tea towel and leave in a warm place for another hour, or until doubled in size., Once risen, use your fingers to push down into the dough again to make lots of little wells and dips. Place in the hot oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. Leave to cool slightly, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and serve."

Stir in the cheese and season with sea salt and black pepper., Now, I’m rather hoping you’ve had a go at making my Cheeky chilli-pepper chutney, but if you haven’t then you can cheat by using a good shop-bought version, or simply chop up a little fresh chilli, to your taste., Lightly toast your slices of bread on both sides. Smear a good tablespoon of your chutney on to each slice, right to the edge, followed by a quarter of your rarebit mixture. By spreading it right to the edge, the crust won’t burn., Grill until melted and bubbling. Divide on to plates. With a knife, criss-cross the topping and drizzle with Worcestershire sauce."

             fresh thyme, balsamic vinegar","Place the flours and ½ tablespoon of sea salt into a large bowl, and make a well in the middle. Add the yeast and sugar to the lukewarm water, and mix with a fork. Leave this for a few minutes and, when it starts to foam, slowly pour it into the well, mixing with a fork as you go., As soon as all the ingredients come together, which may take a minute or so, knead vigorously for around 5 minutes until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough., Lightly oil a large bowl with some olive oil and transfer the dough to the bowl. Dust with a little extra flour, cover with a tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for 30 minutes until doubled in size., While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7 and prepare the toppings., For the balsamic onion topping, finely slice the onions and pick the thyme leaves. Fry the onions and thyme in 2 tablespoons of olive oil over a low heat for about 5 minutes. Add 6 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, reduce for a minute or two, then leave to cool., For the basil and cherry tomato topping, pick and roughly chop the basil leaves and halve the tomatoes. Pop the basil and tomatoes into a bowl and season with sea salt and black pepper, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a tiny splash of white wine vinegar. Peel and slice the garlic and mix into the bowl., To cook the focaccia, as soon as the dough has risen, pound it, then place on a baking tray and spread it out to cover the tray. Push down roughly on top of the dough like a piano to make lots of rough dips and wells., Divide the onion and the tomato toppings over two thirds of the focaccia., For the three-cheese and rosemary topping, break up the Taleggio and the goat’s cheese over the remaining third of the focaccia. Grate a handful of Parmesan cheese and pick the rosemary leaves. Sprinkle both over the final third and season with pepper. Finish with a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt., Leave to prove for a further 20 minutes, then bake for 20 minutes, until golden on top and soft in the middle."

Finely grate the lemon zest into a bowl, add ricotta and honey, then beat together until light and fluffy., Mash half the raspberries with a fork and ripple through the ricotta., Grease the inside of the metal rings with oil, then place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat – work in batches, according to the number of metal rings you have., When the pan’s nice and hot, spoon some mixture into each ring, so it’s roughly 1cm deep. Turn the heat down to low and leave for 15 minutes to cook through – keep an eye on them and reduce the heat slightly, if you think the bottoms are getting too dark., When the time’s up, bubbles and crumpet-like dimples should have formed on the top — turn the crumpets over, using tongs to lift the rings away. Cook for another 5 to 10 minutes, or perfectly golden., Serve the crumpets warm with a generous spoonful of ricotta, a scattering of fresh raspberries and an extra drizzle of honey, if you like."

Remove 100g of the mix and keep this to one side., Add the remaining teaspoon of ginger to the processor, then roughly chop and add the mixed peel and ginger, followed by the flour and baking powder. Pulse until well mixed., Melt the syrup, treacle and butter together in a large pan. Once melted, stir in the mixture from the food processor until thoroughly combined., Tip onto the baking tray and spread out evenly. Press the mixture down into the tray, using your fingers or the back of a spoon. When the mix is a flat, dense and even layer, pop the tray in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes., Take the tray out of the oven and sprinkle the hot gingerbread with the reserved crumbs, pressing them down really well with a potato masher or spatula., Carefully cut into good-sized pieces with a sharp knife, and leave to cool in the tray before eating."

If using cardamom pods, lightly bash them in a pestle and mortar, then pick out the husks and pound the seeds to a fine powder. Beat the eggs and a pinch of sea salt in a large bowl, then add the cardamom, sugar, melted butter, 500g of the flour and the milk and yeast mixture. Whisk constantly as you add everything so you end up with quite a thick, gluey consistency. Mix in the remaining 300g of flour until you have a dough. Use clean floured hands to bring the dough together, then dust the top with flour. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to prove for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size and is full of air pockets., Meanwhile, put the blueberries and caster sugar into a bowl. Finely grate the orange zest and add most of it to the bowl, along with a good squeeze of orange juice, then mash together with a potato masher. Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper, then dot the paper with a few knobs of the butter and sprinkle over half the demerara sugar., Dust a clean surface and your hands with flour and gently stretch and pull the risen dough out until it’s a bit bigger than an A4 piece of paper. This next bit is pretty messy, so have a bowl of flour on hand to help you handle the dough and don’t be alarmed if it seems quite wet. Use a slotted spoon to move half the mashed blueberries on to the dough. Try not to include too much juice. Use the back of the spoon to spread the blueberries around the dough. Pull the sides of the dough up and into the middle like an envelope, and keep turning and pushing the dough together., Cut the dough into 8 equal portions, then pull and stretch each one into a long, thin sausage shape, twisting them around on themselves so you get a sort of rough knot. Arrange them on the tray, leaving enough room between for them to spread as they cook. Push your fingers into the top of each one to make a little well, then spoon in a few of the remaining mashed berries and gently push them down. Spoon over a little of the blueberry juice from the bowl, then sprinkle with the rest of your demerara and the reserved orange zest. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove for about 20 minutes in a warm place., Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Once the buns have risen, put them into the oven and cook for 25 minutes, until golden and crispy. Serve them, hot and delicious, by themselves or with warm custard."

This should end up being about 1 metre/39 inches long and about 18–20cm/7 or 8 inches wide., Along the middle of the bread, lay out your Parma ham, eggs, cheese, basil and tomatoes and olives if you're using them. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and season with pepper and a pinch of salt. Pull the dough over the filling so it forms what looks like a cannelloni shape. Then what you need to do is bring one end round to the other so that they join up. Pinch and pat the two ends together firmly to form a doughnut-shaped loaf. Transfer to a flour-dusted baking tin, allow to prove for 15 minutes, dust with flour and place in your preheated oven at 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 for 35 minutes until golden. Allow to cool and then either transport to a picnic and carve it there – if you're lucky, it will still be a little warm in the middle – or eat there and then. Fantastic."

picked","I'm not quite sure where I got the inspiration for this recipe – I think it was actually when I was making bread one day and I incorporated some really sweet caramelized garlic and almonds into a focaccia. There's a slightly Spanish feel to the main ingredients – think of it as putting a bunch of old friends together and having a good party! My mother's initial reaction was, ‘My God, that's a lot of garlic, you'll stink!’ but don't let the amount put you off, as when garlic is roasted in its skin the pungent flavour is replaced by a jammy sweetness which is divine., Roast the garlic cloves in a preheated oven at 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 for around half an hour until soft to the touch. Meanwhile, take a large pot and slowly fry the white onion in 4 tablespoons of olive oil for about 10 minutes until really soft and translucent. Add the cream and the stock, bring back to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes, awaiting your garlic. Remove the garlic from the oven and allow to cool slightly before squeezing out all the sweet, golden paste. Whisk this into the soup. Discard the garlic skins., Remove the crusts from your ciabatta, rip up the bread into small pieces and throw into the soup. Add the sherry vinegar, then allow the soup to simmer for 5 more minutes. Whiz it until smooth in your food processor with your toasted almonds. Season nicely to taste and serve in big bowls sprinkled with some orange segments, torn up coriander and mint, and drizzled with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil., Try this: You can eat this cold in the summer – it's obviously going to be thick, which I think is a nice thing, but you can thin it with a little milk or stock if you want to., And this: You may want to big up the sherry vinegar to give it that twang you get with a Spanish gazpacho soup., Or this: There's a similar recipe from Spain where sliced white grapes are added to the soup – this contrasts really well with the garlic, so give it a go. A handful will do. Nice when eaten both hot and cold."

Dissolve the yeast with a teaspoon of the honey in half the water and put to one side. Mix the flour with a good pinch of salt and shape into a pile on a clean work surface., Make a well in the centre and, when the yeast and honey mix has frothed up, pour it into the well and mix gradually with the flour until it’s all soaked up. Pour on the rest of the tepid water and mix in all the flour to make a nice, moist, soft dough. Place in a clean bowl, cover with cling film and leave in a warm place for 15 minutes or so., Meanwhile, bash the rosemary in a pestle and mortar, add a little olive oil and bash again. Cut the grapes in half and put to one side., When the dough has doubled in size, place it on the work surface and knead until smooth. Cut the dough into 4 pieces, knead each piece again briefly and shape them into 4 small pizzas., Brush the pizzas with the bashed rosemary sprigs, leaving them smeared with rosemary oil, then scatter with the halved red grapes. Drizzle each pizza with a teaspoon of honey, and, finally, shave some pecorino over the top., Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until the pizza bases are cooked and the cheese is bubbling and melted."

Although the rest of the ingredients are for one topping, there is no point in cooking less pork than this – you can use any leftovers in sandwiches. This is also a great way to use up leftovers from a roast pork joint., Preheat your oven to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3. Score the pork shoulder. Bash the fennel seeds and rub them over the pork, then season and rub with olive oil. Roast in the preheated oven for at least 4 hours, until the meat is tender and shreds easily. When cool, shred up using a fork or your hands. Dress the meat with a little of the cooking juices – it will have almost the texture of a confit of duck., Smear the tomato sauce thinly over the pizza base and scatter over a small handful of your roasted pork and some small pieces of Taleggio. Sprinkle with the thyme leaves, drizzle with olive oil and cook until crisp and golden. Dress the rocket with a tiny bit of lemon juice, scatter over the pizza and serve."

They’re used for breakfast, lunch or dinner and carry, complement or mop up whatever is being served with them. Apparently, in the old days, if a Navajo woman couldn’t whip up a batch of fluffy flatbreads, her chances of marrying a decent bloke were pretty low. No pressure! These are brilliantly simple to make., Mix your flour, baking powder and herbs or spices (if using) in a large bowl with 1 heaped teaspoon of sea salt, using a fork. Make a well in the centre, then pour in the olive oil and about 150ml of warm water. Use the fork to gradually bring in the flour from the edge of the bowl, and add another splash of water if you think it’s too dry. Once it starts to combine, wet your hands and use them to really bring it all together until you have a nice ball of dough., Dust your hands and a clean work surface with flour and knead the dough with your hands until it is smooth and elastic. This will take about 5 to 10 minutes. Pop the dough back into the bowl, dust it with a bit more flour, then cover and leave to relax., Divide your dough into 10 equal-sized balls, then lightly oil your hands and squeeze each ball between your palms to flatten them slightly. Dust with a little flour as you go, and pat and slap the dough from the palm of one hand to the top of the other. Turn and twist the dough about in a circular movement as you go and keep slapping from hand to hand – each flatbread should be about 1cm thick. You’ll probably mess up a few, but practice makes perfect., Normally the flatbreads are cooked as you’re making them. You can do this on a barbecue or in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Cook them for a few minutes on each side and check the underside – you want them to puff up with a nice bit of golden colour. Keep them warm in a basket covered with a tea towel until you’re ready to serve them., Serve them while they’re lovely and warm, or you can reheat them with anything from burgers, to stews and soups, to salads."

This should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes., Cover the mixing bowl with a tea towel and leave to rest, in a warm place, for 45 minutes or until the dough has doubled in size. This allows the bread to become lighter and softer in texture., While the dough is rising, prepare a baking tray by lightly oiling the base and sides using vegetable oil. Now’s a good time to make sure your wood fire oven is pre-lit and ready for your bread., Transfer the dough to the baking tray. Spread out evenly using the palm of your hands and gently expel the gas from the dough (you’ll notice that the dough is airy)., Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil over the surface of the dough using your fingertips; 'dimple' the dough ensuring that you don’t press all the way through to the base., Cover with the tea towel and leave to rest in a warm place for a further 20 to 40 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size., Place the baking tray in the wood-fired oven for 15 minutes or until lightly golden; this will vary depending on temperature so it's best to keep a close eye on the bread for your first attempt., Just prior to the bread coming out of the wood-fired oven, mix together 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of water. Whisk lightly until it becomes an opaque emulsion. Once removed, brush the bread with the emulsion (I use a pastry brush), which makes the bread surface moist., To finish, stud the bread with fresh sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt. Serve warm with a small bowl of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar."

Add the capers, onion, peppers, bread and anchovies, if using. Mix again with your hands to really get the flavours going., Stir in 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar and about 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Have a taste and add more salt, pepper, vinegar or oil if you think it's needed., Tear the basil leaves over the salad, give it another good stir, and it’s ready to serve. Lovely on a hot summer’s day with barbecued meats or roast chicken., Tip: If you can’t get hold of ciabatta, any country-style bread will do."

After the dough has doubled in size, you need to knock the air out of it by bashing it around for a minute. Now it’s ready to be transformed into pizzas or flatbreads., Tear off chunks of the dough and roll out your bread, shaping into slightly irregular oval shape rounds, about 0.5cm thick., Oil the grill on the barbie, then lay the flatbreads on top of the grill and cook them for about 3 minutes. Turn them over and cook for another 3 minutes until they are golden brown, crispy and slightly charred – this’ll give them a real barbecued flavour., Take the flatbreads off the barbie. Mix a couple of lugs of olive oil with the rosemary leaves and brush (or drizzle) over the hot breads. Sprinkle with salt and serve straight away while still warm."

Use a little of it to butter a medium-sized shallow, ovenproof dish., Butter the bread using the flavoured butter, then cut each slice in half diagonally. Put the slices in your buttered dish., Now separate the eggs, reserving all 9 yolks but just 1 egg white. Whisk together the egg yolks and egg white with the sugar, then gently heat the milk and cream in a saucepan with the vanilla seeds and pod. Pour into the eggs, stirring all the time. Remove the vanilla pod then pour the mixture over the bread and leave to soak for at least 20 minutes., Put the dish in a roasting tray and pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up the side of the dish. Then put it in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, or until the custard has just set., Meanwhile, gently warm the marmalade in a saucepan, then remove the dish from the oven and brush the marmalade over the top of the bread. Pop the dish back into the oven for another 5 to 10 minutes. Allow it to cool and firm up slightly before serving."

The chef fried the thin bases in oil, like poppadoms, then quickly topped them with tomato sauce, mozzarella and a little bit of oregano and popped them straight under a hot grill. They were the lightest pizzas I've ever eaten – just incredible – and this is how the first ever pizzas were made.

First, make your basic pizza dough. Now make your tomato sauce. Heat a saucepan, add a splash of oil and the sliced garlic and cook gently. When the garlic has turned light golden, add half the basil, the tomatoes and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Cook gently for about 20 minutes, mashing the tomatoes until smooth, then taste, season again and put to one side., Preheat your grill to its highest temperature. Divide the dough into 10 pieces and press them flat on to a floured work surface. Roll them out to about 0.5cm/¼ inch thick and allow them to rest for 10 minutes or so. Heat a frying pan over a high heat, add about 2cm of vegetable oil and fry each pizza for 30 seconds or so on each side. Remove with tongs and place on a baking tray., Once all the bases are fried, smear each one with a spoonful of the tomato sauce and tear over some mozzarella and a leaf or two of basil or dried oregano. Drizzle with olive oil and grill until the cheese is bubbling and the dough is light brown and cooked through."

I'm told that in the old days the bread would have been so stale that it would have to be soaked in a little stock or juice to make it chewy and edible again, but don't worry. In this day and age you don't have to do this. In Italy they simply grill a 1cm/½ inch slice of ciabatta, rub it with a cut clove of garlic, drizzle it with oil and season it with salt and pepper. Crostini are a great aperitivo with a drink, especially if you offer a few different toppings. Here are a few of my faves to get you into the spirit of things – each one will make enough to top 12 slices of crostini., Grill your slices of ciabatta. While they're still hot, rub them gently with the cut side of the garlic and drizzle with good-quality extra virgin olive oil. Now finish with your favourite toppings..., buffalo mozzarella and chilli
mixed herbs
pea and broadbean pureé with pecorino
prosciutto, figs and mint
tomato and olives

It's normally made from a large loaf of sourdough natural yeast bread, which is a dark grey colour and has a higher water content than usual in the dough. It also has a thick crust and, because of this, moisture is retained in the bread, meaning it can be used up to a week after purchasing. Have a look round a farmers' market or in a good supermarket and you should be able to find some. If you can't, a good-quality round cottage-style loaf will give you good results. ”",335,14g,2g,1.9g,2.0g,7.6g,49.9g,1.5g,"1                                                                                                                                                                large loaf                                                                                                                                                                sourdough natural yeast bread, 1                                                                                                                                                                clove                                                                                                                                                                garlic, extra virgin olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                tiny pinch                                                                                                                                                                salt","The bread is best sliced 1cm thick and toasted on a barbecue, but it can also be done in a griddle pan for ease at home., After that it should be lightly rubbed a couple of times with a cut clove of garlic, then drizzled with some good extra virgin olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper., The toppings can be as humble or as luxurious as you like, from chopped herbs or a squashed tomato with basil, to marinated vegetables or beautiful cheeses, to lovely flaked crabmeat. The only rule is that whatever goes on top of a bruschetta should be nice and fresh and cooked with care., These are my favourite toppings. They will each cover 4 to 6 slices.

tomato and basil bruschette, If you have a large loaf, cut it in half, then slice it crossways about 1cm thick. Chargrill these slices on a barbecue or in a griddle pan until they are crisp on both sides, then lightly rub each piece a couple of times with a cut clove of garlic., Drizzle with some good extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with a tiny pinch of salt.

Reduce to a low heat and simmer very gently for 5 minutes to let the flavours infuse. Remove from the heat and leave to stand for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, cut the crusts off of the ciabatta loaves. Tear 1½ loaves into chunks and pulse them in a food processor until you have coarse breadcrumbs., Strain the milk through a sieve into a jug, discarding everything left behind in the sieve., Return the milk to the pan and bring back to the boil over a high heat. Reduce to a medium heat and simmer, gradually stirring in the breadcrumbs until you’ve used them all up., Add the butter and cream to the pan, stir well, then have a taste and season with a little more salt and pepper, if needed., Have a look at the sauce – you want it to be the perfect consistency for you. If it’s too runny, blitz the remaining ciabatta and add some more breadcrumbs, if it’s a little thick, add more milk. Transfer to a jug or bowl and serve., If you’re making this for another day, you want the consistency to be a little looser than you’d like as it will thicken as it sits, so add a bit more milk. When you’re happy with the consistency, spoon into a bowl and leave to cool. Once cool, cover the bowl with cling film and place in the fridge until Christmas Day."

Continue to mix, bringing in all the flour – when the dough comes together and becomes too hard to mix with your fork, flour your hands and begin to pat it into a ball., Knead the dough by rolling it backwards and forwards, using your hands to stretch, pull and push the dough. Keep kneading for 10 minutes, or until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough., Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to to prove for 45 minutes, or until doubled in size., For the sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick the basil leaves and finely chop the stalks., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan on a medium-low heat, add the garlic and basil stalks, then cook gently for a couple of minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden, then add most of the basil leaves, the tomatoes, and a pinch of salt and pepper., Leave the sauce to tick away for around 20 minutes, or until smooth, breaking up the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon. When the time’s up, taste, and season to perfection., To assemble the pizzas, divide the dough in half. Wrap one half in clingfilm and freeze for another day. With the remaining half, divide the dough into 4 equal balls., Flour each dough ball, then cover with clingfilm, and leave to rest for about 15 minutes – this will make them easier to roll it thinly., Dust a clean surface and the dough with a little flour or semolina, and roll it out into a rough circle, about ½cm thick., Tear off an appropriately sized piece of tin foil, rub it with olive oil, dust well with flour or semolina and place the pizza base on top. Continue doing the same with the remaining dough, dust with a little flour so you can pile them up. Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge., When you're ready to cook them, preheat the oven to 250°C/500°F/gas 9., At this stage you can apply your topping: spread the tomato sauce over the base, spreading it out to the edges. Tear over the mozzarella and scatter with the remaining basil leaves. Drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil and add a pinch of salt and pepper., If you can, cook the pizzas on a piece of granite in your conventional oven – if not, cook them one by one on pieces of tin foil directly on the bars of the oven shelf, towards the bottom of the oven (If you're going to cook your pizzas on the bars of the oven, make sure they're not too big – otherwise they'll be difficult to manoeuvre). Cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the pizzas are golden and crispy."

Pile the flour on to a clean surface and make a large well in the centre. Pour half your water into the well, then add your yeast, sugar and salt and stir with a fork., Stage 2: getting it together
Slowly, but confidently, bring in the flour from the inside of the well. (You don't want to break the walls of the well, or the water will go everywhere.) Continue to bring the flour in to the centre until you get a stodgy, porridgey consistency – then add the remaining water. Continue to mix until it's stodgy again, then you can be more aggressive, bringing in all the flour, making the mix less sticky. Flour your hands and pat and push the dough together with all the remaining flour. (Certain flours need a little more or less water, so feel free to adjust.), Stage 3: kneading!
This is where you get stuck in. With a bit of elbow grease, simply push, fold, slap and roll the dough around, over and over, for 4 or 5 minutes until you have a silky and elastic dough., Stage 4: first prove
Flour the top of your dough. Put it in a bowl, cover with cling film, and allow it to prove for about half an hour until doubled in size – ideally in a warm, moist, draught-free place. This will improve the flavour and texture of your dough and it's always exciting to know that the old yeast has kicked into action., Stage 5: second prove, flavouring and shaping
Once the dough has doubled in size, knock the air out for 30 seconds by bashing it and squashing it. You can now shape it or flavour it as required – folded, filled, tray-baked, whatever – and leave it to prove for a second time for 30 minutes to an hour until it has doubled in size once more. This is the most important part, as the second prove will give it the air that finally ends up being cooked into your bread, giving you the really light, soft texture that we all love in fresh bread. So remember – don't fiddle with it, just let it do its thing., Stage 6: cooking your bread
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Very gently place your bread dough on to a flour-dusted baking tray and into the preheated oven.  Don't slam the door or you'll lose the air that you need. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until cooked and golden brown. You can tell if it's cooked by tapping its bottom – if it sounds hollow it's done, if it doesn't then pop it back in for a little longer. Once cooked, place on a rack and allow it to cool for at least 30 minutes – fandabidozi. Feel free to freeze any leftover bread."

The mix will be surprisingly wet., Pour it into a measuring jug, then top up with water until you have 625ml or just over 1 pint. At Stage 1 of the basic bread recipe, use this banana liquid instead of the water to flavour your bread and make it nice and chewy. Also add half the honey with the nuts to the dough at this point. Then continue through the basic recipe as normal., At Stage 5 divide the dough into 10 balls. Then pack these next to each other in a flour-dusted baking tin where they will prove together. Before putting in the oven drizzle generously with the rest of the honey so that the top of the bread will caramelize, going nice and golden., Bake in a preheated oven at 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5 for 20 minutes. Allow to cool for a little while, but it's best served still warm with butter and a glass of milk for breakfast while you read the paper. Also fantastic used in bread and butter pudding or simply heated up with a bit of ice cream."

Add the unpeeled garlic cloves and a little squeeze of lemon juice and cook until the stalks are tender., Drain in a colander, then place the artichokes straight back into the empty pan with 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil and fry for 4 minutes to get a bit of colour on them., When they're slightly golden, remove from the heat, squeeze in a little lemon juice, pick, roughly chop and add the mint leaves, then season carefully to taste with sea salt and black pepper., Remove 4 artichoke halves from the pan and put to one side, then mash all the rest in the pan, using a fork to squash the garlic out of the skins (throw the skins away)., For the basic bruschette, cut the loaf in half, then slice it crossways, about 1cm thick., Chargrill these slices on a barbecue or in a griddle pan until they are crisp on both sides, then lightly rub each piece a couple of times with a cut clove of garlic., Drizzle with some good extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with a tiny pinch of sea salt., Spread the mashed artichokes over the basic bruschette, tearing one of the reserved artichoke halves over the top of each."

You will probably need to do this in several batches., While the aubergines are grilling, put 8 tablespoons of olive oil and 3 tablespoons of vinegar, with the parsley, mint and garlic, into another bowl and season with salt and pepper., When the aubergines are all done, add them to the dressing and mix around, then check the seasoning again and divide on to the bruschetta. Press the topping into the toast so all the lovely flavour gets sucked in!"

Repeat with the rest of the mixture and the other slice alongside it., Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden, then confidently flip over to cook for the same amount of time. Meanwhile, smash up the pistachios in a pestle and mortar – toast them first, if you like., Serve the eggy bread dolloped with yoghurt, sprinkled with pistachios and an extra pinch of cinnamon and drizzled with a little honey."

and slice the onions and garlic, peel and finely grate the ginger., Put all this into a large high-sided roasting tray with the curry paste and a lug of groundnut oil. Toss together until well coated, then roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until sticky and caramelized., Remove half the roasted veg to a large pan to start your daal and return the tray to the oven to keep warm – turn the oven off so that the veg don’t dry out., Place the pan on a low heat on the hob. Stir in the split peas, crumble in the stock cube and add 2 litres of boiling water., Simmer for around 1 hour 20 minutes with the lid on, or until the split peas are tender and the daal has thickened, stirring occasionally, and adding splashes of water to loosen, if needed., Meanwhile, place the flour in a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt and make a well in the middle. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 150ml of water to the well and mix together with a fork., When it comes together as dough, tip it on to a flour-dusted surface, knead until smooth, then divide into 12 balls. Roll each one into a circle, nice and thin, turning as you go and dusting with a little extra flour, if needed., Put a frying pan on a medium heat and cook the chapatis for 1 minute on each side, or until cooked but not coloured. Stack them in tin foil as you go and keep them warm until needed., Put 1 mug of rice and 2 mugs of boiling water into a pan with a pinch of salt. Cook on a medium heat with the lid on for 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed., Meanwhile, to make the flavoured oil (called a temper), finely slice the chilli and place it in a small frying pan on a medium heat with the curry leaves, mustard seeds and a good lug of groundnut oil for 1 to 2 minutes, or until crispy., Load up your warm chapatis with rice, daal and a scattering of roasted veggies, drizzle over the temper, roll up and tuck in."
