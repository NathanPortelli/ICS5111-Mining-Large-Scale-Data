Peel and finely slice the garlic and trim, wash and finely slice the white part of the leeks (save the green tops for tasty cooking another day – they work great in soups or stocks)., Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a large shallow casserole pan over a medium heat and add the garlic. Finely slice the basil stalks, then add them to the pan, along with the dried oregano and gently fry for a couple of minutes., Add the chopped leeks to the pan, season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and cook gently for 10 minutes, until softened, stirring regularly and adjusting the heat to low if they start to colour., Tip in the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of your spoon, then half-fill each tin with water, swirl around and pour into the pan. Bring to the boil, then reduce to low and leave to tick away for 15 to 20 minutes., Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water for 8 minutes, then drain, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water., Tip the sauce into a blender with most of the basil leaves (reserving a few to serve) and whiz until smooth (you may need to work in batches), then season to perfection. Return the sauce to the casserole pan, stir through the cooked pasta, loosening with the reserved cooking water if needs be., Finely grate over the cheese, then nestle the frozen spinach into the pasta. Sprinkle over the garlic breadcrumbs and bake for 20 minutes, until the crumbs are golden, the pasta is tender and the sauce is blipping., When it’s cooked, let it sit for a couple of minutes, then sprinkle over the reserved basil leaves, and finish with a final grating of Parmesan. Delicious served with a crisp green salad."

Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and cook gently for a further 5 to 7 minutes, or until the rice is fluffy and fragrant and the fish is pearly white and flaking., Dollop 4 tablespoons of natural yoghurt into a bowl, ripple through 2 teaspoons of harissa and drizzle lightly with olive oil., Finely slice the remaining spring onion and ½ a fresh red chilli (if using), then scatter over the top along with the reserved coriander leaves.

Crumble in 50g of feta cheese and season to taste with sea salt and black pepper., Pick and roughly chop ½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley (15g) and ½ a bunch of fresh dill (15g), then stir half into the spinach mixture., In a bowl, whisk the remaining 50g of feta with 200g of natural yoghurt and 4 large eggs until well mixed., Working one at a time, lay a sheet of filo pastry on a clean worktop, brush with a little olive oil and spread with a little spinach mixture. Roll into a long sausage shape and place in a 30cm x 40cm baking dish. Repeat until all the filo (275g in total) and spinach is used up and the baking dish is filled with neat rows of filo., Pour over the egg mixture, brush with olive oil, then finely grate over 10g of Cheddar. Bake for 35 minutes, or until golden., Scatter the remaining herbs over the top, and serve."

Mix all the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Make a few cuts in the chicken pieces to let the marinade soak in, then add the chicken pieces to the bowl and mix well, making sure they are all coated. Leave overnight in the refrigerator – even just 30 minutes is fine., Add the spinach to a blender with 3 tablespoons of water and blend to a smooth paste. You may need to do this in batches. Separately, blend the ginger, garlic and green chilli with 2–3 tablespoons of water to form a paste. Set aside., Heat the oil in a heavy-based, non-stick saucepan or kadhai, over a medium heat. Add the whole spices and fry for a few seconds. Add the onions and fry for 15 minutes, stirring well, until the colour begins to change. Add the ginger, garlic and chilli paste and fry for a further 2 minutes, stirring. Add a splash of water if it begins to stick to the base of the pan, then add the tomato purée. Fry for a couple of minutes, then stir in the ground coriander., Now add the marinated chicken and fry for 7–8 minutes, stirring and making sure to seal the pieces well. Reduce the heat to a low, season to taste, then cover and cook for 15–17 minutes until the chicken is cooked through, stirring halfway to make sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan., Now add the puréed spinach and continue to simmer over a low heat for a further 5–7 minutes, with the lid on. Finish with the garam masala, fresh coriander and ginger matchsticks, and stir together. Serve with naan or pulao, some raita and pickled slices of onion."

the marinade, pick the marjoram leaves into a pestle and mortar, bash to a rough paste with a pinch of sea salt, then muddle in 4 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar., Slice the green tops off the leeks (keep for soups or stock), then cut the white parts in half lengthways. Wash them, then chop into 3cm pieces and transfer to a shallow, snug-fitting casserole pan with the whole bulb of garlic., Score lines in a criss-cross pattern in the pork fat at ½cm intervals across the entire length of the loin (make sure you don’t cut through to the meat). Then rub the loin with half of the marinade and place on top of the leeks. Using a small sharp knife, stab the pork skin all over, rub with a tablespoon of olive oil, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and place on a large baking tray., Reduce the oven temp to 200°C/400°F/gas 6, place the crackling on the top shelf and the pork on the shelf beneath, then roast for 1 hour., Meanwhile, prep the greens. Tear the cavolo nero leaves, discarding the stalks, and finely slice the Savoy cabbage, discarding any tough stalky bits as you go, then finely slice the chard, stalks and all. Cook the cabbage, cavolo nero and toughest chard leaves in a pan of boiling water over a medium heat for 3 minutes, then add the tenderest chard leaves and simmer for 1 more minute., Tip the spinach into a colander, then drain the greens directly over it to wilt. Lay all the greens on a clean work surface to cool, then wrap in a clean tea towel and squeeze out all the excess liquid. Transfer to a board and chop everything finely. Reheat in a pan when ready to serve and dress with salt, pepper and a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar., Remove the pork loin and crackling from the oven and transfer to a board to rest for 30 minutes. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves from their skins into the pan – discarding the skins as you go – then tip in the beans and chickpeas, juice and all. Place on a medium heat on the hob and gently simmer for 5 minutes, until heated through. Stir through the crème fraîche, season to taste and pour in any resting juices from the pork., To serve, spoon the beans onto serving plates and scatter over the cooked greens. Top each plate with two slices of pork, pour over the remaining Salmoriglio sauce and break over the crackling. Serve with a glass of chilled Valpolicella."

Cook for 8 minutes without moving it, or until the fat is well rendered and the skin is golden and crispy., Meanwhile, finely chop the bacon. Peel and finely slice the garlic., Turn the duck over and cook for 4 minutes on the other side, then remove to a plate to rest, leaving the pan of duck fat on the heat., Sprinkle the bacon and garlic into the hot pan, strip in the rosemary leaves and cook for 2 minutes, or until golden, stirring regularly., Add a splash of red wine vinegar and stir to pick up any sticky bits, then pour in the beans, juice and all. Simmer for a couple of minutes, then stir through the spinach until wilted., Slice the duck breast at an angle. Divide the beans between your plates and arrange the duck on top, spooning over any resting juices, to finish."

Peel the onion, trim the celery, then finely chop or coarsely grate them., Put 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 knob of butter, plus the onion and celery into a high-sided pan on a low heat. Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the veg is soft but not coloured., Turn up the heat to medium, add the rice and stir for 2 minutes, so it sucks up all the lovely flavour. If using, pour in the wine and stir until absorbed., Add a ladleful of hot stock, stir, and wait until it’s been fully absorbed before adding more. Cook for 16 to 18 minutes, adding more stock every minute or so and stirring regularly, until the rice is al dente. This means it should be soft and a pleasure to eat, but still holding its shape., About 5 minutes before your rice is ready, stir in the frozen veg to cook through., Now, your risotto needs to be slightly looser than you want it to be, as it will thicken as it sits, so add an extra ladleful of stock. Turn off the heat, stir or beat in the remaining butter and the Parmesan, then season to perfection., Pop the lid on and let it sit for 2 minutes before serving. The most important thing is that the risotto is always oozy., Finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, an extra grating of cheese and, if you’ve got it, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice per portion."

Cook on one side only for 2 minutes, or until lightly golden, then stack up on a serving plate and repeat., Top each pancake with dollops of cottage cheese, the avocado salad, and a few good shakes of chilli sauce.

Tip into a blender, add the spinach and whiz until smooth – you may need to work in batches., Season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, then stir through the pasta and broccoli florets, loosening with a splash of milk, if needed., Transfer to a 25cm x 35cm baking dish, grate over the remaining Cheddar and scatter over the almonds. Bake for 30 minutes, or until beautifully golden and bubbling."

Carefully slice at just under ½cm intervals all the way along, putting the veg into a large roasting tray as you go., Peel the garlic and place in a pestle and mortar, strip in the thyme leaves, then bash to a paste and muddle in 6 tablespoons of oil, the vinegar, and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Toss well with the veg, then roast for 1 hour, or until golden and caramelised, turning halfway., Remove all the veg to a board and place the tray over a medium heat on the hob. Pour in the wine and leave to bubble and cook away, scraping up all the sticky caramelised bits from the bottom of the tray., Tip in the lentils (juices and all) and spinach, then stir until the juices have thickened and the leaves have wilted., Season to taste with salt and pepper, ripple through the yoghurt, then present to the table with the board of veg.

It takes a little longer than some other pastas, but it’s worth the effort because it’s such a joy to eat – a real showstopper if you want to turn heads. The one thing I would advise, though, is that you practise making it the week before your party! And make sure you have a very large pan or, even better, a fish kettle in which to cook it. (This is the dish that actually got me into writing books and doing all that sort of business, as it’s what I was cooking in the background of a documentary when I was spotted all those years ago, so it’s pretty close to my heart!) ”",521,25.1g,13g,4.9g,1g,26.7g,48.3g,4.2g,"450

Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7., Halve, deseed and chop the butternut squash into big chunks and rub them with a little olive oil., Bash up the coriander seeds, fennel seeds and chilli in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Dust this mix over your pieces of squash, then put them into a snug-fitting ovenproof dish or roasting tray, covered with a dampened piece of greaseproof paper., Pop the tray into the oven for about 30 minutes, then remove the paper and let the squash roast for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden., While this is cooking, pick the marjoram or oregano leaves, discarding the stalks, and peel and finely slice the garlic., Get a large pan nice and hot and add a little olive oil, the herb leaves and sliced garlic. Move it all around for 20 seconds, then add the spinach., Water will cook out of it as it heats up – this is fine, though, as we will cook it away. Using a pair of tongs, keep the spinach moving quickly around the pan, then after a minute add a couple of knobs of butter and a good grating of nutmeg and stir it around a bit more. Keep cooking until the moisture has cooked away then season to taste and allow to cool., To roll out your pasta either use a pasta machine to give you 4 or 5 long sheets (15cm x 30cm wide) and stick them together using a little water, or you can do what I do and use a rolling pin on a large surface, dusting with flour on top of and underneath the dough. Have a go at both ways., Keep it in a rectangular shape but trim it as necessary. Roll out to the thickness of a beer mat and the size of a tea towel, then lay it out on top of a clean tea towel., Once you’ve done this, spoon a line of squash along the long edge of the sheet nearest you., Sprinkle the spinach over the rest of the sheet, leaving the top 5cm of the pasta sheet clear., Crumble the ricotta over the spinach, finely grate over the Parmesan and you’re ready to begin rolling!, Brush the last clear edge of the pasta sheet with a little water then, working carefully, use the nearest edge of the tea towel to roll the pasta up and away from you, like a Swiss roll., Roll the rotolo up in the tea towel and tie it firmly at each end using some string. You can secure the sausage shape even further by tying some more round the middle if you want. Tie a little extra string at one end so it can hang out of the cooking pot and act as a handle., Now, to cook the rotolo, get your fish kettle or very large pan with a lid and fill it with boiling salted water., Lower the rotolo in and use the fish kettle rack on top to keep it submerged. If using a saucepan, hold the rotolo down with a plate. Simmer for about 25 minutes., While it’s cooking, you need to clarify some butter. To do this, take the remaining butter and place it in an ovenproof dish in the oven on a low plate-warming temperature (80°C). Over the next 10 to 15 minutes it will melt and you’ll see that the milky whey will sink to the bottom., Discard any white bits floating on the top, then spoon out the clear golden butter and put to one side. Discard the whey. You won’t need all the butter now, but it’s quite hard to clarify any less than this – you can leave the extra in the fridge to use for your roast potatoes another day., Now you’ve removed the whey from the butter, you can heat it up more aggressively. So put about 3 tablespoons of your clarified butter into a pan and heat it up. Test to see if the butter is hot enough by adding a sage leaf to it. If it fries nicely, add the rest of the leaves and fry for about 30 seconds until they begin to crisp up. Then remove from the heat and put to one side., When the rotolo is ready, carefully remove it from the pan, take the string off, unroll it and slice it up – a couple of slices per portion., Scatter a few sage leaves over the top, drizzle with a little of your sage-flavoured butter, and finish off with a grating of Parmesan.

mustard, white wine vinegar","To make the muffins, place the milk in a jug, stir in the yeast and sugar, and leave for a couple of minutes until frothy., Place the flour and 2 teaspoons of fine sea salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the middle. Pour in the milk mixture and mix well to form a dough. Shape into a ball and knead with clean hands or in a freestanding mixer until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a clean damp tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size., Knock back the dough and roll out on a flour-dusted surface to about 2cm thick. Stamp out 10 level circles with an 8cm round cutter, rerolling as necessary., Carefully place the muffins onto a large tray lined with a large sheet of semolina-dusted greaseproof paper and sprinkle over a little more semolina. Cover with a tea towel and leave to prove for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in size., Heat a heavy non-stick pan or griddle over a low heat, add the muffins and cook for 6 to 7 minutes on each side or until golden – you may need to do this in batches. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly., Meanwhile, make the hollandaise. Gently melt the butter in a small pan., Whisk the egg yolks, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and the mustard in a heatproof bowl set over a shallow pan of simmering water., Slowly pour in the melted butter, whisking constantly until well combined. Whisk in a splash of vinegar, then have a taste and season to perfection. Turn the heat off and keep warm over the pan of water, stirring occasionally. Loosen with a splash of water if needed., Trim, wash and finely chop the spring onions. Peel and finely slice the garlic., Place a large frying pan on a medium-low heat with a little drizzle of olive oil, add the spring onions, garlic and spinach, then pick in the marjoram. Finely grate over some nutmeg, then add a pinch of sea salt and some freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 5 minutes or until the spinach is dark and delicious. Add lemon juice to taste and keep warm until ready to serve., Place a large, shallow pan of water on a medium heat and bring to the boil., Grease four tea cups with butter and crack an egg into each. Place the cups in the pan of water, then cover and poach for 4 to 5 minutes or until the eggs are cooked to your liking., To assemble, halve 4 warm muffins and divide the spinach and smoked salmon between each. Top with a perfectly poached egg, lightly season, then spoon a tablespoon of hollandaise over each one.  Finish with a final grating of nutmeg and a few sprigs of chervil, if you like."

Season with a pinch of black pepper and a couple of pinches of dried oregano., Finely grate in the lemon zest, drizzle in a little oil, then toss in the toasted pine nuts. Mix well., Melt the butter in the frying pan over a medium heat with a drizzle of oil, add half the spinach, stirring until wilted, then when there’s space, add the remaining spinach, stirring regularly until wilted., Lay a 50cm strip of greaseproof paper out on a clean work surface, rub lightly with oil and scrunch up, then flatten out again., Arrange 4 sheets of filo in a large rectangle on the greaseproof paper, overlapping at the edges, so that it’s almost covering the greaseproof., Rub the filo with a little oil, sprinkle with sea salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Repeat until you have 3 layers., Stir the wilted spinach into the egg mixture, then grate in half the nutmeg and mix well., Slide the greaseproof and filo into the empty frying pan, so that the edges spill over, then push down into the sides of the pan., Pour in the spinach mixture and spread out evenly, then fold the filo up over the filling to cover., Place the pan over a medium heat for 2 minutes, just to get the bottom cooking, then transfer to the top shelf of the oven for 18 to 20 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Delicious served with a fresh seasonal salad."

Strip in half the thyme leaves (15g) and cook for 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Put 20g of dried porcini mushrooms in a bowl, cover with boiling kettle water and leave to rehydrate., Tear up or halve any larger mushrooms (350g in total), keeping any smaller, delicate ones whole, then stir into the pan. Drain, roughly chop and add the porcini, reserving the soaking liquor., Simmer 1.2 litres of vegetable stock in a pan on a low heat, adding the reserved soaking liquor, discarding the last gritty bit., Stir 300g of risotto rice into the mushroom pan for 2 minutes, then pour in 125ml of white wine and stir until absorbed., Add a ladleful of stock and wait until it’s been fully absorbed before adding the next. Repeat this, stirring and massaging the starch out for the rice for 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked but still holding its shape and the risotto is oozy., Meanwhile, toast 30g of blanched hazelnuts in a frying pan over a medium heat until golden, then roughly bash in a pestle and mortar., Squeeze the juice from 1 lemon into a small bowl, then mix in 4 tablespoons of natural yoghurt, 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Divide 100g of baby spinach between 4 plates, dot over the dressing, then sprinkle over the hazelnuts., Turn off the heat under the risotto, finely grate in 35g of Parmesan and strip in the remaining thyme leaves (15g), then beat in 20g of unsalted butter and season to taste with salt and pepper., Cover and leave to relax for 2 minutes so it becomes creamy and oozy. Beat again, then serve right away with the salad, finishing it with a fine grating of Parmesan (5g)."

Tie the thyme sprigs together., Melt half the butter in a large pan on a low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, then add the onions, garlic, celery, leeks, potatoes, bay leaves and thyme. Cover and sweat down for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Add all the mince to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Turn the heat up to medium-high and cook for 10 more minutes, or until the mince is browned all over, stirring occasionally., Pour in the wine, let it bubble and boil away, then finely grate in half the nutmeg. Stir in the flour for 1 minute, then pour in the milk. Season with sea salt and black pepper, cover with a scrunched-up sheet of wet greaseproof paper and transfer to the oven for 2 hours, or until thickened and beautifully tender., At this stage, the ragù might look like it’s split a little, but this is actually what we’re looking for – the milk in the sauce creates amazing ricotta-like curds as it cooks., Meanwhile, place a large heatproof baking dish on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil and the remaining butter. Peel, finely chop and add the remaining garlic, along with the chilli flakes, nettles (leaves only – wear gloves to protect your hands while you prep) and spinach – you’ll need to work in batches. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened., Allow to cool, then finely chop and return to the dish, spreading evenly over the base. Once done, divide the ragù in two, freezing one half for another day, once cool., Carefully drain the liquid from the remaining ragù into a bowl through a coarse sieve. Return the ragù to the pan, fish out and discard the thyme stalks and bay, then grate in half the cheese and stir well., Turn the oven up to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Use a piping bag or teaspoon to stuff the cannelloni tubes with the ragù, then arrange on top of the greens. Pour the sieved liquid over the top and grate over the remaining cheese. Trim and finely slice the mushrooms and scatter over the cannelloni., Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, then bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. For added colour, flash the dish under the grill for 5 minutes. Importantly, let it stand for 30 minutes before serving. Delicious with a seasonal salad for added crunch."

  skin-on almonds","Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., To make your filling, wash the squash, carefully cut it in half lengthways and remove the seeds, then chop into eight big chunks and place in a large roasting tray., Add the whole ricotta, sprinkle over the chilli flakes and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then finely grate over half the nutmeg. Drizzle with oil and gently toss together. Roast for 1 hour., Crumble up the chestnuts, pick the sage leaves, toss both in a little oil, then sprinkle into the tray. Roast for another 15 minutes, or until the squash is tender and golden, and the ricotta is gnarly-looking., Finely grate the Parmesan into the tray, season and mash it all together, as chunky or smooth as you like. Leave to cool completely., Make the pasta dough in a food processor, blitzing the spinach and egg yolks together before adding the dry ingredients. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and pop into the fridge for 30 minutes., Divide the pasta in half, saving one half for another day. Cut the remaining piece in two (wrapping one piece back up momentarily), and roll out into sheets that are just 2mm thick – use a pasta machine, or do it by hand with a rolling pin., Cut into rectangles 15cm x 12cm. Spoon 2 tablespoons of filling along the length of each one, near the bottom edge, leaving 1.5cm at either end., Brush the exposed pasta with a damp brush, then roll up and pinch in the sides to seal and create cracker shapes., Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling to make 24 crackers in total. Transfer to semolina-dusted greaseproof paper as you go., For the sauce, melt the butter in a large frying pan, then, once foamy and starting to darken, squeeze in the clementine juice and swirl to create a creamy butter sauce. Season with pepper and keep warm over a very low heat until needed., Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water for 3 to 4 minutes, transferring it to the buttery sauce when cooked, with a splash of cooking water. Work in batches (the first will happily sit in the sauce while you cook the rest)., Finish with a grating of nutmeg and Parmesan, and a scattering of toasted, crushed almonds."

Drizzle each tray with 2 tablespoons of oil and sprinkle with black pepper., Rub everything to combine, then roast the leaves for 20 to 25 minutes, or until slightly charred, tossing halfway through with tongs. There should not be any liquid left – if there is, squeeze it out., Reduce the oven temperature to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a small frying pan over a medium heat until golden brown. Remove from the heat and set aside or later., Let the leaves cool, then transfer to a bowl or tray. Roughly chop the dill and add to the leaves. Crumble over the feta, then toss everything together. Taste and adjust the seasoning., Brush a shallow baking tray (30 x 24 x 2.5cm) with some of the remaining oil. Place 1 sheet of filo on the tray, allowing the pastry to hang over the sides., Lightly brush with oil and sprinkle with a pinch of sesame seeds. Place another sheet of filo in the opposite direction, again allowing some overhang. Lightly brush with oil and a pinch of sesame seeds. Continue until you have used six sheets., Lay the spinach mix over the pastry. Place another sheet of filo on top, folding it in two. Lightly brush with oil and sesame seeds., Gently fold over the edges of the bottom layers of pastry. Add 2 more sheets of filo, again brushing with oil and sprinkling sesame seeds in between., Finish with a light brush of oil and sesame seeds, and gently score the top into 8 squares, using a sharp knife., Bake for 50 minutes, or until golden brown. (It will look done after 30 to 40 minutes, but have faith.) Leave it to rest for 10 minutes, then slide off the baking tray, slice into portions and serve."

heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and half the butter. Pick in the oregano leaves and cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly., Add the spinach and cook for a further 15 to 20 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated, still stirring regularly. Remove from the heat, taste, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper and allow to cool., Meanwhile, make the sauce: wash, trim and finely slice the leek, then place in a large pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, the remaining butter and the sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for 15 minutes, or until sweet and tender, stirring regularly., Pour in the wine and let it bubble and cook away, then stir in the flour and, splash by splash, stir in the milk. Leave it to simmer for 5 minutes, then liquidize in a blender until silky smooth., Grate in the cheese, add a pinch of cayenne and blitz again to combine. Taste and season to perfection, then leave to cool completely., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7 and place a large baking sheet inside to heat up., On a large sheet of flour-dusted greaseproof paper, roll out the pastry so it’s 10cm bigger than your salmon all the way round., Pour away any excess liquid from the cooled spinach mixture, then spoon it on to the middle of the pastry and spread it across the surface, leaving a 3cm border at the edges. Place the salmon in the middle, then roll up the sides of the pastry to create the crust, going right up to the salmon and pinching it at the corners to secure it in place., Lightly score the top of the salmon in a criss-cross fashion, then pour the cool cheesy sauce over the fish. Brush the exposed pastry with beaten egg, then carefully lift the greaseproof and salmon en croûte on to the preheated tray., Bake at the bottom of the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. This is delicious served with a garden salad and lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over."

Blanch the spinach in a pan of boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes, or until wilted. Drain in a colander, squeeze out any excess water, then blitz in a food processor until roughly puréed. Set aside., Cut the paneer into 1.5cm cubes. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wide non-stick frying pan, then stir-fry the paneer for 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside., Peel and thinly slice the onion, then peel and finely grate the garlic and ginger. Put to one side., Heat 2 more tablespoons of oil in the same frying pan. Add the black mustard seeds and cumin seeds and stir-fry for about 30 seconds, until they begin to become fragrant, then add the onion and fry over a low heat for about 5 to 6 minutes, or until softened., Add the grated ginger, garlic and curry powder to the pan and continue to cook for a further minute or so. Then, stir in the spinach and cook over a medium heat for another 3 to 4 minutes., Add the paneer and cream. Cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until piping hot. Squeeze in half the lemon juice, then taste and season, adding more lemon juice, if you like. Put to one side and keep warm., To make the pancakes, place the flour in a large bowl and season with sea salt. Make a well in the centre and add the eggs and half of the milk., Melt the butter in a medium non-stick frying pan (roughly 20cm). Allow to cool a little, then add to the batter along with the remaining milk. Whisk everything until smooth., Trim and finely slice the spring onions and chillies (deseeding if you like), then pick and finely chop the herb leaves. Stir it all into the batter, along with the cumin seeds and turmeric until well combined. Leave the batter to rest for at least 15 minutes., Lightly grease the frying pan with oil and place over a medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add a ladleful of batter, turning the pan so it evenly and thinly coats the base. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until set and lightly golden. Flip over with a spatula and cook the other side for another minute, until golden., Slip the pancake onto a warm plate and keep covered with a clean tea towel while you make the rest of the pancakes. You should have 8 in total., When you’re ready to serve, place large spoonfuls of the spinach and paneer mixture in the middle of each pancake and fold into triangles or roll up to enclose the filling., Drizzle with a little yoghurt and scatter over some chopped coriander and diced red chilli (if using). You could also serve the stack of pancakes with all the accoutrements on the table and just let everyone help themselves."

Tip into a food processor, finely grate in the lemon zest, add a squeeze of juice, then blitz until finely chopped., Taste and season to perfection, then, once cool enough to handle, pop the greens into a big sandwich bag, snip off the corner and pipe into the cannelloni tubes., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Return the pan to the heat (there’s no need to clean it) with 1 tablespoon of oil. Peel the remaining garlic, finely slice with the chilli and basil stalks, add to the pan and fry until lightly golden., Pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Half-fill the tins with water, swirl around and pour into the pan., Bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. Taste and season to perfection – you want the sauce quite wet, as the pasta will soak lots of it up., Pour into a baking dish (25cm x 30cm) and line up the filled cannelloni on top, pushing them into the sauce., Finely grate the Parmesan into the food processor (there’s no need to clean it). Add the ricotta, egg, milk, the basil leaves and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and blitz until smooth., Pour it over the cannelloni, making sure all the tubes are covered, then bake on the bottom shelf of the oven for 40 minutes, or until cooked through., Serve with hunks of seeded brown bread to up your carb intake, and a fresh side salad of your choice., Peel and finely slice the onions and 4 cloves of garlic and place in a large non- stick pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil., Cook and stir while you prep the fresh greens—wash the leaves, trimming away any tough stalks.

oil, then put on a medium heat (starting from cold helps the fat to render out of the bacon)., Wash and trim 1 large carrot and 1 bunch of spring onions, chop into 1cm dice, and once the bacon is lightly golden, stir them into the tray. Finely slice and stir in the stalks from ½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley. Cook for 10 minutes, to soften, stirring regularly, then stir in 2 tablespoons of plain flour., Gradually pour in 600ml of semi-skimmed milk, bring up to a good simmer, then stir in 2 teaspoons English mustard and 400g of frozen chopped spinach. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the spinach has thawed., Chop 4 salmon fillets into bite-sized chunks, halve 200g of raw peeled prawns, finely chop the parsley leaves and stir it all through the sauce with 400g of frozen peas, then crumble 125g of feta over the top and turn the heat off., Meanwhile, wash 600g each of sweet potatoes and spuds (leaving the skins on for extra nutritional benefit) and chop into 3cm chunks. Cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until cooked through, then drain and mash well, taste, and season to perfection., Gently spoon the mash over the fish pie filling, spreading it out with a fork. Bake for 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp on top, and bubbling at the edges."

Add the yeast mix and 2 tablespoons of oil. Beat and pour in the eggs, and stir with a wooden spoon until a dough forms., Knead the dough on a lightly flour-dusted surface for 10 minutes, adding extra flour to the dough if it’s too sticky., Lightly grease the bowl with oil, then return the dough to the bowl. Cover with a cloth and leave in a warm place for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size., To make the lamb and cheese filling, peel and thinly slice the onion. Peel and finely chop the garlic, then trim and chop the spring onions. Cut the lamb into cubes., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan, add the onion, garlic and spring onions and sauté for 5 minutes, or until softened. Remove from the pan., Season the lamb and brown in the pan over a medium heat – you may need to do this in batches., Stir in the cinnamon, then return the onion mixture to the pan. Add the white wine and 100ml of water, and stir to pick up the crispy bits on the base. Simmer for 30 minutes, with a lid on for the first 5 minutes., Beat 1 egg in a bowl, then grate in the cheeses. Cook the spinach or chard in a large pan of boiling water, then drain and leave to cool., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4. Lightly grease a 23cm springform tart tin with a little oil., Divide the dough in half. Lightly flour a work surface and roll the first piece of dough into a circle, about 35cm wide., Carefully place it into the tin, lightly pressing into the base and sides, leaving about 3cm of pastry hanging over the rim., Spread half the lamb mixture over the base, followed by half the cheese mixture. Chop the cooled greens, then scatter half on top. Repeat with remaining ingredients., Roll out the second piece of dough and place over the filling., Trim the edges, but leave about 4cm of overhang, then roll it up and crimp the edges., Make a hole in the centre of the pastry lid.

Lightly grease a 20cm x 30cm baking dish with oil., Get the kids to help you cover the baking dish with a layer of pastry, letting the edges overhang slightly. Brush with a little oil, then add another layer of pastry, repeating until you have used it all (there should be 3 or 4 layers)., Boil the kettle, then place the spinach in a colander and pour over the hot water to wilt it (you may have to do this in 2 batches). Push the spinach down with the back of a spoon, then, when it’s cool enough to handle, have the kids squeeze out any excess water, using their hands. Place the spinach on a board and roughly chop, then place in a large bowl and set aside., Put the grill on high and grill the bacon till crisp, then set aside to cool., Whisk the eggs in a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Whisk in the milk and mustard powder, snip in the chives, then grate in the lemon zest., Have the kids crumble the cooled bacon into the spinach and then trim, slice and add the leeks. Mix well and scatter into the filo pastry case. Pour over the egg mixture and carefully place the dish on the bottom of the oven., Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until just set. Leave the pie to cool for 20 minutes before slicing. Delicious served with a crisp green salad."

Toss the chicken in the marinade and leave aside., Blanch the greens in a large pan of boiling water until just tender enough to eat but still vibrant in colour, then drain, reserving the water., In a bowl, just cover the couscous with boiling greens water, season, pop a plate on top and leave for 10 minutes. Pick and finely chop the mint leaves and stir into the fluffy couscous with the juice of half a lemon, then season to perfection., Toast the hazelnuts in a large dry non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat, removing and crushing in a pestle and mortar once lightly golden., Return the frying pan to a high heat and cook the chicken for 4 minutes on each side, or until cooked through, turning halfway and adding the peppers when you flip the chicken. Reheat the greens, if needed., Meanwhile, you can either make a quick houmous (put three-quarters into the fridge for another day if making a full batch) or simply use yoghurt – both options are delicious., Serve the chicken with the couscous, peppers, greens and houmous or yoghurt, scattered with the hazelnuts and with a lemon wedge on the side. Nice with a drizzle of hot chilli sauce too."

Peel and crush in the garlic, then muddle in 1 tablespoon of oil, the vinegar and a generous pinch of cayenne., Chop the chicken and bread into 2cm chunks and, in a bowl, toss and mix well with the marinade until evenly coated., Take a little care in skewering up the chicken and bread chunks, randomly interspersing them with the bay leaves on four short skewers and using hardy rosemary stalks, wooden or metal skewers as appropriate. Of course, check that the skewers will fit inside your largest non-stick frying pan., Place the frying pan on a medium-high heat. Lay the skewers in the pan and cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until cooked through and golden. I like to place a lid and weight on top so that the chicken makes really nice contact with the pan and gets super-crispy., Meanwhile, top and tail the blood oranges, trim off the peel, then slice into rounds. Dress the spinach with a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of oil, arrange on your plates with the blood oranges and drizzle with the balsamic. Top with the kebabs, crumble over the feta and serve with lemon wedges."

Gently bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Gradually add 4 tablespoons of lemon juice, stirring continuously so the curds and whey separate., Carefully pour the mixture into the sieve so the curds collect in the muslin. Place under cold running water to get rid of any whey, then gather up the muslin and squeeze out the excess moisture., Keeping the muslin bundle in the sieve, cover it with a plate and top with a few heavy weights (a couple of tins work well). Place in the fridge for 1 hour 30 minutes to set. Once set, cut the paneer into 2cm chunks., Drizzle a lug of oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, add the paneer and fry for 5 minutes, or until golden, stirring frequently. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain., Peel and finely chop the onion, garlic and ginger., Return the pan to a medium-low heat, adding a splash more oil, if needed. Add the cumin seeds, fry for 1 minute, then add the onion and cook for around 8 minutes, or until softened., Stir in the garlic, ginger, garam masala and turmeric. Halve, deseed and very finely chop the tomato, add to the pan and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally., Stir in the frozen spinach, cover and cook for 5 minutes, then stir in the cream, paneer and a splash of boiling water., Reduce the heat to low and cook for a further 5 minutes with the lid off, or until reduced to a deliciously creamy consistency. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper and serve immediately."

chilli","Preheat the oven to 190°C/375ºF/gas 5. Line a shallow baking tin (roughly 22cm x 32cm) with greaseproof paper., Carefully halve the squash, scoop out and discard the seeds (there’s no need to peel it), then chop into rough 3cm wedges. Place into a large roasting tray with a splash of olive oil, the chilli flakes and a small pinch of salt and pepper. Toss to coat., Bash and add the garlic cloves to the tray, then pop in the hot oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until tender., Meanwhile, place a frying pan over a medium heat, then add the almonds, fennel seeds and a pinch of salt. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden (keep an eye on them!), then bash well in a pestle and mortar., Take the squash out of the oven (keep the oven on for later). Scoop the flesh into a food processor and discard the skin. Squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins, add to the processor, then whiz to a smooth purée., Separate the egg yolks from the whites into two large bowls. Grate the Parmesan over the yolks, then stir in the squash purée, flour, a good grating of nutmeg and a pinch of salt and pepper., Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks in a separate bowl then carefully fold it into the squash mixture. Transfer to the lined tin, spreading it out evenly. Bake for 14 to 15 minutes, or until set and springy., Meanwhile, heat a splash of olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then add the spinach and cook for around 2 minutes until wilted. Leave to cool, squeeze out the excess moisture, then finely chop., Turn out the roulade onto a large piece of greaseproof paper. Carefully peel away and discard the top layer of greaseproof paper., Crumble the goat’s cheese into a bowl, then add the ricotta, lemon zest and juice. Deseed, finely chop and add the chilli, stir well, then season to taste with sea salt and black pepper., Spread the mixture over the sponge, leaving a rough 2cm gap along one of the longest edges. Scatter over the spinach and one-third of the almonds., Starting at the longest edge with no filling, carefully roll up the sponge, using the greaseproof paper to help you., Scatter over the remaining nuts, then carve into thick slices and serve straight away with a fresh green salad."

Transfer to a food processor, along with the chestnut purée, suet and maple syrup, and blitz until it comes together into a ball. It will be sticky to begin with, so stop and scrape the sides as you go., Place a large sheet of greaseproof paper on a work surface and sit the dough on it. Then, with lots of gluten-free flour on your hands and rolling pin, roll out the dough as thinly as possible (less than 5mm)., If you’re making individual tartlets, oil and flour four 10cm loose-bottomed tart tins, then cut the pastry to size. For 1 large tart, roll out the dough and cut to the size of a large, shallow baking tin, and transfer to the tin using a fish slice., Prick the pastry all over with a fork, cover with greaseproof paper, fill with baking beans or rice and bake blind for 12 to 15 minutes. Leave to cool in the tray, and keep the oven on., Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms. Heat 1 tablespoon of rapeseed oil in a pan over a medium heat, then sauté the mushrooms for 6 to 8 minutes, until golden. Remove and set aside., In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of rapeseed oil and wilt the spinach (or heat through if frozen) along with the pepper. Blitz the spinach, avocado flesh, tofu, nutmeg and lemon juice in a food processor until smooth., Thinly slice the sweet potato using a vegetable peeler or mandolin, creating a pile of peelings. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a small pan, then fry the peelings over a high heat, turning occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes, until just turning crisp., Assemble the tart by spreading the spinach mixture over the baked and cooled tart base. Lay the mushrooms on top, and decorate with the sweet potato slivers and a scattering of toasted pine nuts. Eat at room temperature, or heat it up, if you like."

In the same pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil and gently sweat the onion until soft., Scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands and add the garlic and bay leaf. Pick in a few basil leaves and grate in the zest of the lemon half, then let it gently simmer for 20 minutes until the sauce has thickened. Season with salt and pepper., Have the kids squeeze the moisture out of the spinach into the bowl. Place the spinach on a board so you can chop it up. Return the spinach to the liquid in the bowl., Beat the egg and grate 2 teaspoons of Parmesan cheese. Get the kids to stir the ricotta, egg and Parmesan into the spinach. Season to taste., Sit a piping bag in a jug, fold its edges over the rim, then spoon in the spinach mixture. Have the kids help pipe the mixture into the cannelloni tubes and lay them in a 20cm x 25cm oven dish., Spread the tomato sauce over the cannelloni. Pick the remaining basil leaves and scatter most of them over the tomato sauce. Slice the mozzarella and lay the slices on top, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and season., Place in the oven and cook for 35 to 40 minutes or till the top is golden and the pasta tender (if the top browns too fast, cover the dish with foil). Remove from the oven and let stand for a few minutes before serving with the remaining basil leaves."

Add a good pinch of sea salt, toss and scrunch it all together, then leave for 5 minutes., Meanwhile, mix the mustard, a good squeeze of lemon juice, and a couple of lugs of extra virgin olive oil with a little pinch of salt and black pepper in a medium bowl and put aside., Drizzle a really good lug of olive oil into a large bowl and add a good pinch of pepper. Handful by handful, squeeze the potato and carrot mixture to get rid of the excess salty liquid, then sprinkle into the bowl., Toss in the oil and pepper until well mixed, then evenly scatter it over a large oiled baking tray (roughly 30cm x 40cm). Roast for around 35 minutes, or until golden on top and super-crispy around the edges., Meanwhile, blanch the peas for a minute in a large pan of boiling salted water, then scoop out, add to the bowl of dressing and pile the spinach on top., Just before your rösti is ready, with the water gently simmering, crack in the eggs, poach to your liking, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon., Serve the rösti with the eggs on top. Quickly toss the salad together to dress it and scatter in piles on the rösti, then crumble over the feta and serve. I like to whack it in the middle of the table and let everyone dig in."

Drain and mash well with a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, the zest from the lemon and the butter. Set aside., Peel and chop the carrots and onions, then fry them in a large ovenproof pan (roughly 30cm in diameter) with 1 tablespoon of oil over a medium heat for 15 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, heat the milk in a pan on a medium heat. Once simmering, add all the frozen fish fillets and cook for around 10 minutes, or until cooked through, then use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a plate, taking the pan off the heat., Stir the flour into the carrots and onions, then gradually add the warm milk, a ladleful at a time, stirring continuously until you have a smooth sauce. Stir in the spinach until thawed and incorporated, then season to perfection., Flake in the cooked fish fillets (carefully remove and discard any skin or bones), add the prawns and mustard, along with the juice of half the lemon, grate in the Cheddar, and stir gently to combine., Top with the pea-spiked mash and smooth out, scuffing it up slightly with a fork to give it texture that will crisp up. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until beautifully golden. Serve with a good old helping of baked beans (if you like). Delicious!"

Get your fishmonger to pinbone the fish if you don’t know how to. The roast trout looks fancy but there’s nothing difficult about it. In fact, if you can tie up a parcel you can make it., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Season the trout with salt and pepper and dust in the ground almonds. Lay 4 of the fillets on a board, skin-side down., Chop the apricots and half of the sage together. Mix and lay in a line along the tops of the 4 fillets. Top with the remaining fillets, skin-side up, matching heads and tails with the 4 below. Overlap the remaining sage along the length of each trout sandwich., Cut 4 x 20cm lengths of string and lay them parallel to each other on a work surface, leaving about 3–4cm between each one. Lay 1 of your trout sandwiches across the lengths of string and tie them all up. You should end up with a neat parcel tied in 4 places. Repeat with the other 3., Heat a large saucepan. Add a large splash of oil and gently fry the garlic until softened. Add the spinach and wilt down, seasoning with salt and pepper and the grated nutmeg. Spread the spinach out in a roasting tray and mix with the pulses. Put the trout parcels on top. Lay the prosciutto slices over the bean mixture, drizzle with oil and bake for 15–20 minutes until the prosciutto is crispy and the fish cooked through."

This will taste great, and it goes with just about anything – pasta, fish or meat. If there is any excess moisture when the spinach is cooked, just tilt the pan so it runs to the other side and pour it away. Let the spinach sit for a minute and then serve."

grated","Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Then find a metal baking tray or ovenproof dish that will fit the cannelloni in one layer so it's nice and snug. This way you'll get the right cover of sauce and the right amount of crispiness on top. When I cook this at home I just use one pan to cut down on lots of washing up!, Take your metal tray or a saucepan, put it on a high heat and add your butter, a drizzle of olive oil, one of the sliced garlic cloves, a handful of marjoram or oregano and the grated nutmeg. By the time the pan is hot the garlic should be soft., Put as much spinach as will fit into the pan. Keep turning it over; it will wilt quickly so you will be able to keep adding more spinach until it's all in. Moisture will cook out of the spinach, which is fine. By cooking it this way you don't lose any of the nutrients that you would if boiling it in water., After 5 minutes, put the spinach into a large bowl and leave to cool. Place the pan back on the heat, add a little olive oil, the other clove of sliced garlic, your basil stalks and the tomatoes, then fill one of the empty tomato tins with cold water and add this too., Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down, add a pinch of salt and pepper and the sugar, and simmer for about 10 minutes, until you get a loose tomato sauce consistency. Then take the pan off the heat and add the basil leaves., By now the spinach will have cooled down, so squeeze any excess liquid out of it and pour this back into the bowl. Finely chop the spinach and put it back into the bowl. Mix it with the liquid, add the ricotta and a handful of the Parmesan, and then use a piping bag to squeeze the mixture into the cannelloni. You can make your own piping bag by getting a sandwich bag and putting the spinach mix into the corner of it. Then twist the bag up and cut the corner off. Carefully squeeze the filling into the cannelloni tubes so each one is filled right up – really easy., Lay the cannelloni over the tomato sauce in the pan. Or you can pour the tomato sauce into your ovenproof dish and lay the cannelloni on top., To make the white sauce, mix together the crème fraîche, anchovies and the 2 handfuls of Parmesan with a little salt and pepper, then loosen with a little water until you can spoon it over the cannelloni., Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan and the mozzarella pieces, and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes until golden and bubbling."

baby spinach","Start by making a temper. Peel the garlic, then finely slice with the chillies, ideally 1mm thick on a mandolin (use the guard!)., Pour 2 tablespoons of oil into a large wide pan on a medium heat and add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and curry leaves for 1 minute, then the garlic and chillies., Stir so everything’s flat, moving regularly until crisp and lightly golden. With a slotted spoon, remove half the temper to a plate, taking the pan off the heat., Peel the onions and ginger and finely chop with the coriander stalks, then chop the squash into 2cm cubes, leaving the skin on but discarding any seeds. Stir it all into the pan and return to a medium heat for 15 minutes to soften., Stir in the lentils, then 1.5 litres of boiling water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer and cover for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally., Mash the squash into the daal, taste and season to perfection. Remove 6 portions, bag them up and, once completely cool, freeze for a rainy day when you’ll be really grateful it’s there, leaving the rest on a low heat to keep warm., Blitz the coriander leaves, yoghurt, a pinch of sea salt and half the lime juice in a blender until smooth, then decant into a small bowl., Reheat the reserved temper in a non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat with 1 teaspoon of oil, then divide into two piles and crack an egg over each. Cover and leave to slowly fry on the bottom for 2 or 3 minutes, while they coddle on top., One-by-one, puff up your dry poppadoms in the microwave for around 30 seconds each., Top each portion of daal with a fried egg, and pop some spinach, dressing, poppadoms and a lime wedge on the side."
