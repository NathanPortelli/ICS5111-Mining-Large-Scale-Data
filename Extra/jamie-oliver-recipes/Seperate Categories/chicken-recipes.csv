Non-nuclear fire noodles | Jamie Oliver Cookbook Club recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/153430889.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",,"“Buldak Nuclear Fire Noodles are the best-selling instant noodles from Korean brand Samyang and have something of a cult following. TikTokers and YouTubers began taking on the challenge of eating a bowl of these spicy noodles and recording their sweaty, nose-dribbling demise. What keeps them all coming back for more, though, is that despite the heat (4,404 Scoville units, to be precise), the noodles are moreishly tasty. While this extreme level of heat is not something I crave, the spicy, chickeny flavour definitely is. And so these are the building blocks of this dish. I love adding a raw egg yolk to the centre as the heat from the noodles cooks the yolk and it adds a lovely creaminess. If you’d rather, you could always fry the egg. If you want to make this vegan, omit the chicken thighs and egg, and switch the chicken bouillon for mushroom bouillon powder. ”",,,,,,,,,"1

Set aside., Heat the oil in a non-stick, heavy-based frying pan (skillet). Add the chicken pieces and sear on all sides. Once sealed, pour in the sauce from the jug and allow it to bubble away for 2–3 minutes or until the chicken is just cooked through. Add the noodles and spring onions (scallions), tossing to coat., Divide the noodles between two bowls. Make a little dent in the middle of each and plop in an egg yolk, if using. Sprinkle with the torn nori and crispy garlic and serve immediately."

grinder). You can use the spices as a dry rub, or muddle in 2 tablespoons each of olive oil and red wine vinegar to make a marinade., Use a fork to pierce the underside of the chicken a few times, going all the way down to the bone (this will help create big flavour). Toss the chicken in the spiced rub or marinade, then cover and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight., Place all of the sauce ingredients into a medium saucepan over a high heat (you can do this on the hob or by placing a small pan on the direct side of the barbecue). Add a pinch of sea salt, whisk well to combine, then bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it's sticky and coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and allow it to cool slightly., Once you’re ready to cook, preheat your barbecue (see tip). Place the chicken skin-side down on the direct or hot side of the barbecue and cook for 2 minutes, calming down any flames by putting the lid on., Using tongs, carefully turn the chicken over and transfer to the cooler part of the barbecue, where the indirect heat is (if you want to add some water-soaked fruit woods, such as Applewood, to the coals for bonus flavour, now’s the time to do it)., Place the lid on (the holes in the lid should be open to allow the air to flow through), and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, checking and turning the chicken throughout, or until the chicken pulls easily away from the bone. When removing the lid, just crack it open slightly before lifting it off completely – this will prevent the ash from blowing up onto the chicken and tainting the flavour., Baste the chicken in half the BBQ sauce (save the rest for another day), place back over the indirect heat and pop the lid back on for 10 minutes, or until sticky, juicy and gnarly., Check the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear, then transfer to a large serving board or platter. If using, finely chop and scatter over the fresh chilli and slice the lemon into wedges for squeezing over. Delicious served with a seasonal salad or barbecued vegetables, rice and flatbreads."

I love serving and teaching this recipe. It is one of the most popular dishes at my feasts and cookery classes, and is especially easy to cook, with readily available ingredients. It truly teaches us to trust the process, trust the ingredients and trust your instincts when cooking. I usually encourage my cooks to taste the raw sauce at the very beginning (before adding the chicken) and then taste it again after cooking, as this dish is full of surprises as it transforms from lip-puckering tartness, to sweet, spicy, zingy and balanced. I love using a combination of sweeter lemons and tart limes. Your yassa can be as mild or as fiery as you wish. Finely mince the scotch bonnet for lots of heat or pierce the chilli and tuck it into the sauce to release its warming and fragrant oils for less heat. You can also omit the scotch bonnet entirely or swap it for other chillies (see my notes about cooking with chillies on page 19 in Africana) and play around with it in different ways. But that tingling heat is a big part of the rousing West African experience.

massage it into the chicken. Place in a wide bowl., Combine the marinade ingredients in a food processor and blend to a smooth paste. Tip the paste onto the chicken, add 2 tablespoons of the oil and massage thoroughly, carefully tucking some of the marinade under the skin and into the slashes. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours, or overnight for a more flavourful marinade and to tenderise tougher poultry., Remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking, to allow it to come up to room temperature. Preheat the grill to medium-high., Drizzle the chicken with the remaining oil. Toss well and arrange in one layer on an oiled grilling tray or rack with thighs skin-side up. Reserve any marinade left in the bowl. Grill each side for 10 minutes, until browned with a nice char on the skin. Set aside to finish cooking in the sauce., Meanwhile, to make the sauce, heat the oil in a wide saucepan and add the onions and any leftover marinade. Sprinkle with a pinch of fine sea salt, cover with a lid and cook over a medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring often, until the onions are translucent. Remove the lid and continue cooking uncovered for another 15–20 minutes, until the onions begin to brown and eventually caramelise in their natural sugars. Add a splash of water, if needed, to prevent burning., Add the pepper and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic until fragrant. Pour in the lime or lemon juice and add the Dijon mustard, chicken stock, thyme, bay leaf and scotch bonnet. Season with the sea salt and freshly ground pepper and bring to a simmer., Tuck the chicken, skin-side up, into the sauce. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the sauce is reduced and the chicken is cooked through., Taste to check the seasoning. If you find the sauce too tart, scoop out 2 tablespoons of sauce into a small bowl and add ½ teaspoon of honey, mix well then pour back into your sauce. Gently stir and taste again. Repeat with another ½ teaspoon of honey, if needed., Scatter with parsley and serve with simple sides, such as rice, steamed couscous, fonio or creamy mashed potatoes and green beans."

Place the ketchup, honey, Worcestershire sauce, most of the smoked paprika and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar in a snug-fitting roasting tray and mix together. Add the chicken and toss to coat. At this point, you can either leave the tray covered in the fridge to marinate, or season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and set aside while you prep the potatoes., Scrub and quarter the potatoes lengthways and place in another large roasting tray. Drizzle in 2 tablespoons of olive oil, season and sprinkle over a pinch of smoked paprika, tossing until coated. Arrange the potatoes skin-side down in one even layer. Place the potato tray on the middle shelf of the oven and the chicken tray on the top shelf to roast for 20 minutes., Once the time’s up, carefully spoon off any fat from the chicken and add to the potatoes, tossing to coat. Baste the chicken in the remaining juices, scraping up any sticky bits from the bottom of the tray. Return both trays to the oven to roast for a further 25 minutes or until the chicken pulls away easily from the bone, placing the frozen corn straight onto the bars of the bottom shelf to cook alongside., Meanwhile, trim the cabbage and carrots, and peel the onion. Coarsely grate it all on a box grater. Place in a bowl with ½ a tablespoon of red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon of oil and the yoghurt. Mix together and season to perfection., Serve the chicken and potatoes alongside the slaw, rolling the corn in all the lovely chicken tray juices before plating up."

There are a few stages to master, but the extra effort is worth it, and really cuts down on your energy use – winner winner, chicken dinner. ”",556,20g,4.7g,16g,1.5g,27.1g,70g,9.4g,"3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onions, 1                                                                                                                                                                rasher of                                                                                                                                                                smoked back bacon, olive oil, 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                    chicken thighs                                                                                                                                                                , skin on, bone in, 7                                                                                                                                                                                                                    carrots, 1.2                                                                                                                                                                kg                                                                                                                                                                potatoes, 2                                                                                                                                                                teaspoons                                                                                                                                                                dried sage, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                cranberry sauce, 3                                                                                                                                                                teaspoons                                                                                                                                                                English mustard, 3                                                                                                                                                                slices of                                                                                                                                                                stale white bread (150g), 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    sweetheart cabbage, 1                                                                                                                                                                heaped tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                plain flour, 480                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                frozen peas","Peel and thickly slice 2 onions and roughly chop the bacon. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a large non-stick frying pan, place on a medium heat, then add the bacon and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the sliced onions and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and cook for 5 minutes, then leave to cool., Meanwhile, use a sharp knife to carefully debone the thigh meat, placing the bones in a 40cm x 30cm roasting tray. Speed-peel and add the carrots (save the peelings), and peel and quarter the remaining onion. Chuck the carrots, their peelings and the onions all in the tray with 1 teaspoon of oil, bringing the carrots and bones to the top., Scrub the potatoes, prick them a few times with a fork and microwave on a high heat (800W) for 15 minutes, or until starting to soften., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Sprinkle a little salt and most of the sage over the chicken, cover with greaseproof paper, then bash with a rolling pin to flatten to 1.5cm thick. Remove the paper then dollop over the cranberry sauce. Spread 1 teaspoon of mustard over each slice of bread, cut in half and lay each piece over each thigh, then sprinkle over the bacon and onions., Roll up the thighs to seal the filling inside, then tie with string or secure with cocktail sticks and transfer to a second 40cm x 30cm roasting tin. Gently squash the potatoes with a potato masher and nestle them into the gaps. Drizzle over 2 tablespoons of oil, sprinkle with the remaining sage and a pinch of salt and pepper., Roast on the middle shelf of the oven for 1 hour, or until the potatoes are golden and the chicken is cooked through, basting halfway. When there’s 40 minutes to go, place the bone tray on the bottom shelf to roast alongside., Meanwhile, trim and halve the cabbage lengthways, then slice each half into three wedges. Place them on top of the carrots and roast for 20 minutes, or until charred. Put the roasted cabbage and 1 carrot aside for later, then tip the remaining carrots into the chicken tray to continue roasting., Boil the kettle. Place the bone tray over a medium-low heat. Mash the carrot into the juices with a potato masher, then stir in the flour. Gradually pour in 750ml of boiling water, stirring and scraping up any gnarly bits from the bottom. Season to taste, then let it bubble to your desired consistency, stirring regularly. Strain through a sieve into a jug., When you’re almost ready to serve, scatter the frozen peas into the frying pan in a single layer, drizzle with 1 teaspoon of oil and arrange the roasted cabbage on top. Cover and place on a high heat to steam for 8 minutes, or until piping hot., Remove the string from the chicken, slice each thigh into 3, take everything to the table and serve."

Take the frozen veg out of the freezer and place on a plate to start defrosting., Use a sharp knife to carefully remove the skin from the chicken thighs, then place the pieces of skin in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat and cook for 10 minutes, until the fat has rendered out and the skin is crisp. Meanwhile, carefully de-bone the thigh meat and chop into 2½cm chunks (don’t throw the bones away – see tip)., Remove the skin from the pan (leaving the rendered fat behind), then finely chop and transfer to a large plate., Place the chicken thigh meat into the pan with 2 teaspoons of thyme and cook for 5 minutes, or until browned. Add the chopped veg mix and spinach and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Put the flour in a bowl with a good pinch of sea salt. Grate in the cold butter, then rub with your fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs. Sprinkle in the remaining thyme and mix well, then pour in 3 tablespoons of cold water and mix with a fork, then bring together with your hands until it forms a dough, adding an extra splash of water, if needed. Roll into a ball, then set aside to rest., Once the time’s up on the veg, go in with the mustard and mushroom soup. Mix well, season with a pinch of salt and black pepper and bring to the boil, then remove from the heat, spoon into a 26cm round pie dish and set aside to cool slightly., Flatten the pastry with your hands until you have a round piece of dough just bigger than the pie dish. Sprinkle over the crispy chicken skin and use a rolling pin to squash it into the pastry., Brush a little milk over the rim of the dish, carefully lay over the pastry and use your hands to crimp the overhang to seal, then brush over another splash of milk (or any remaining sauce from the pan)., Make a small incision in the centre of the pie (so the steam can escape) and bake at the bottom of the oven for 35 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the pie is piping hot. Cook the peas in the microwave according to the packet instructions, drain, then serve alongside the pie."
Kalupol roast chicken | Jamie Oliver recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/141435006.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",,"“This was one of the very first dishes we developed for our menu, based on a classic Kalupol chicken curry. We bought a rotisserie just to cook this one dish and the result was totally worth it. We served this spectacular chicken whole and you could see conversations stop and eyes following the plate every time a waiter walked one through our tiny Soho restaurant. Guests who hadn’t ordered the chicken would watch lustfully and vow to return to eat it another day. Many would return, often again and again, just for this one dish.

By cooking the rice in the same tray, we don’t have to turn on the hob (or face a pile of washing up!). Feel free to swap the peppers for whatever veg you have knocking around – think leeks, broccoli florets or slices of courgette. Plus, it couldn’t be easier to make this vegetarian – check out the tip below for a bit of inspiration. ”",633,22.5g,5.9g,12.4g,0.5g,34.6g,77.6g,5.8g,"2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red onions, 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    mixed-colour peppers, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    chicken legs, skin on, bone-in, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                Cajun seasoning, 4                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar, 1                                                                                                                                                                mug of                                                                                                                                                                basmati rice (300g), 4                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                natural yoghurt, optional: extra virgin olive oil",

Kamil's chicken | Jamie Oliver recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/136705204.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",,"“This recipe has been in the family since Dad was a kid; it’s had many variations, from squashing in a kiwi to tenderise the meat to marinating it overnight with yoghurt. I think that me and Kamil have finally got it to a point where it’s at its best and, to be honest, that’s happened from just simplifying and stripping it down. It’s super important to get yourself a brilliant chicken for this – don’t get me wrong, of course you can make it with a supermarket chicken, but if you can get your hands on a big, beautiful, organic bird, it’s just gonna be better. Growing up, this marinade always went on little cubes of chicken breast or on bone-in, skin-on thighs. The more I cooked on the BBQ and understood temperature, the more I used spatchcocked chickens. Whole chickens aren’t the easiest to cook, but if you have a go, it pays off hugely. BBQ’ing a chicken low and slow is a gamechanger – it allows you to slowly build flavour and great colour. ”",,,,,,,,,"For the chicken, , 3

the chicken, except the chicken and salt, in a bowl and mix together. Use the marinade to cover your chicken, then leave to marinate for 1–8 hours. The marinating time isn’t super important as we’re going to double dip our chicken while it’s cooking., Heat your BBQ to a 3 count* take your chicken out of the marinade, hold it above the bowl and allow the extra oil to drip back in. Season your chicken generously all over, then place it on the BBQ, carcass-side down. The reason we are going carcass-side down first is to check out the BBQ temperature and to give ourselves a little bit of a safety net. The marinade is oil-heavy in order to create that kebab-shop smoke, BUT if we were to go skin-side down first and our grill is too hot, we’ve ruined the skin and it’s pointless after that., I like to turn my chicken regularly, every 2–3 minutes at the beginning. The temperature of the charcoal will drop once you’re cooking so, when it first goes on, it’s vital that we continuously move and turn the chicken so we don’t get any burnt spots. After about 15 minutes, slowly building smoke and colour, we can turn less regularly. Now, when our chicken is gently hissing away, have a poke and prod with a finger and feel the meat; it should feel slightly tighter but still have a waterbed-like fluidity. Check the temperature of your chicken using a meat thermometer – I reckon you’ll be at about 24–34°C/75–93°F., Now it’s time to double-dip your chicken in the marinade, again allowing the excess oil to drip off before putting it back on the BBQ. You can repeat this until the marinade is finished, or give the chicken a little baste with a pastry brush until you’re all out of marinade. Continue cooking the chicken for about 15 minutes., OK, so guys in lab coats will tell you that ‘Your chicken must have a core temperature of at least 75°C/167°F’, but those people don’t cook at home and probably also don’t care about eating a piece of meat at its absolute prime. Take your chicken to 61–62°C/141–144°F and then leave it to rest for about 15 minutes. The internal temperature will creep up to about 65–69°C/149–156°F., While the meat is resting, roughly pick the coriander and parsley leaves – a little stalk is good as that’s where the flavour’s at, plus it also adds another texture. Strip the mint leaves from the stalks. Put all the herbs in heavily-iced water. This will give the herbs a crispness and shock them back to freshness. Leave them in the iced water for a good 10 minutes. Once the herbs have crisped, take ’em out and dry them completely; if you don’t dry them thoroughly, the dressing won’t stick and will just stay in the bottom of your bowl., Slice your chilli super fine – just everyday rounds, nothing special. Put it in a bowl with the rest of the dressed herbs ingredients and mix together. To make the yoghurt and cumin tomatoes, start by toasting and crushing your cumin seeds., Dry-toast the cumin seeds in a small pan over a medium heat until they turn golden brown and fragrant, then transfer to a pestle and mortar and crush into a powder. Slice all your tomatoes in half; I like to do this horizontally as I think they look prettier – it doesn’t add anything to flavour, it’s just attention to detail. Add the cumin, then grate in the garlic. Mix in your yoghurt next and season with a big crack of salt and a little pepper., Add your olive oil and stir it in slowly. The oil and the yoghurt won’t mix so it will all look separate, but we want that. We want the hum of garlic, freshness from the tomatoes, acidity from the yoghurt and pepperiness from the olive oil., Flash your rested meat on the BBQ to warm through and then carve. When you first cut this chicken, the brown meat may look pink but, trust me, it’s cooked; I’ve cooked chickens ‘dangerously’ ever since I met Barnaby Benbow at Fifteen, years ago, and haven’t died since., This dish gets better if you just stick the meat, herbs and tomato in some warm lavash, roll it up all together and smash it."

Now, there will be one piece with 1 bone running through like a small drumstick. Carefully cut the skin around the top of the bone then scrape and push the skin and meat down, gathering at the bottom – this will leave you with the top half of the bone exposed and the meat at the end in a lollipop shape., Keep the wing tip end whole and repeat with the remaining wings. Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7., In a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan, toss the wings in the paprika, cayenne, garlic and baking powder, then roast in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden, crisp and cooked through., Meanwhile, if making the blue cheese dip, blitz the blue cheese with the yoghurt until smooth. Trim and finely slice the spring onions., Remove the wings from the oven and turn it off. Move the wings to the side of the pan and add the butter. Once melted, whisk in the remaining buffalo sauce ingredients and toss gently to coat. Return the wings to the warm oven for 5 minutes so that the glaze sticks to the wings but doesn’t burn., Serve with the blue cheese dip and sliced spring onions sprinkled over the top."

Peel and add 2 cloves of garlic. Finely grate in 20g of Parmesan and the zest from 1 lemon, and squeeze in all the lemon juice. Add a pinch of sea salt and a good pinch of black pepper and blitz until smooth., Pour over the chicken and toss together well, massaging that flavour into the meat., Working in batches, gently turn the chicken strips in the tray of crumbs until nicely coated. Place on a large baking tray, then bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway., Meanwhile, quickly rinse the blender, then put in most of the remaining ½ a bunch of fresh basil (15g) and 4 heaped tablespoons of Greek yoghurt. Peel, destone and add 1 ripe avocado, then blitz until smooth., Taste and season to perfection, then divide between your plates and add a few drips of chipotle Tabasco and extra virgin olive oil to each portion., Lightly toast the remaining 4 pittas, pick apart the leaves from 2 little gem lettuces, and halve 320g of cherry tomatoes., Divide it all between your plates with the goujons, pick over the remaining basil leaves, mix it up and tuck in."

Mix all the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Make a few cuts in the chicken pieces to let the marinade soak in, then add the chicken pieces to the bowl and mix well, making sure they are all coated. Leave overnight in the refrigerator – even just 30 minutes is fine., Add the spinach to a blender with 3 tablespoons of water and blend to a smooth paste. You may need to do this in batches. Separately, blend the ginger, garlic and green chilli with 2–3 tablespoons of water to form a paste. Set aside., Heat the oil in a heavy-based, non-stick saucepan or kadhai, over a medium heat. Add the whole spices and fry for a few seconds. Add the onions and fry for 15 minutes, stirring well, until the colour begins to change. Add the ginger, garlic and chilli paste and fry for a further 2 minutes, stirring. Add a splash of water if it begins to stick to the base of the pan, then add the tomato purée. Fry for a couple of minutes, then stir in the ground coriander., Now add the marinated chicken and fry for 7–8 minutes, stirring and making sure to seal the pieces well. Reduce the heat to a low, season to taste, then cover and cook for 15–17 minutes until the chicken is cooked through, stirring halfway to make sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan., Now add the puréed spinach and continue to simmer over a low heat for a further 5–7 minutes, with the lid on. Finish with the garam masala, fresh coriander and ginger matchsticks, and stir together. Serve with naan or pulao, some raita and pickled slices of onion."

The pickles need to be prepared at least one day ahead for the onions to turn pink and will last for a week in the fridge once drained. You can choose to make either the chicken or lentil satay patties.  ”",,,,,,,,,"CUCUMBER PICKLES, , 2

with the rapeseed oil in a large bowl. Add the chicken strips and buttermilk and turn to coat them all over. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 1 to 2 hours, preferably overnight., Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer (the safest option) or heavy-based, deep saucepan filled to just under half the depth of the pan to 180–190°C (350–375°F) or until a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds., Meanwhile, put the cornflour in a separate bowl with the seasoning and nutmeg and mix well., Dip each chicken strip into the seasoned cornflour to coat evenly – try to do 4 or 5 pieces in quick succession, as you need to drop them into the hot oil straight away., Fry the chicken, in batches, for no more than 3 to 4 minutes to keep them succulent and juicy yet cooked through, and golden and crispy but not burnt. Remove from the oil and drain on kitchen paper, keeping the cooked chicken hot while you fry the rest., It’s that easy – the best fried chicken you’re ever going to eat!"

Season generously with sea salt and black pepper and drizzle with 1 teaspoon of olive oil, then set aside., Using a large sharp knife, carefully cut down the back of the chicken and open it out flat. Rub the butter and a good pinch of salt and pepper all over both sides., Place the potato tray on the bottom shelf of the oven, and the chicken directly onto the shelf above. Place the unpeeled onions on top of the chicken and roast for 1 hour 10 minutes, turning the potatoes regularly and brushing the chicken with the cooking juices using the rosemary sprigs., Trim the beans and cook in boiling salted water for 5 minutes, or until tender. Finely chop the walnuts., Spoon the mustard into a bowl, peel and finely grate in the garlic, then whisk in 1 tablespoon each of walnut oil and extra virgin olive oil and a dash of white wine vinegar. Season to perfection with salt and pepper., Drain the beans and toss them in the dressing, then tip onto a serving plate and sprinkle with the walnuts., Remove the chicken from the oven and leave to rest for a few minutes. Squash the onions and garlic out of their skins and toss through the potatoes. Serve with the chicken and green beans."

Lightly cut through the skin between the chicken leg and breast, so that the leg falls to the side., Bend the leg backwards to disjoint it, and turn breast-side down. Cut between the leg and breast, removing the whole leg, then repeat., Find the joint in between the drumstick and thigh, tap the heel of the knife and cut through the bone, separating the drumstick and thigh, then repeat., Leaving the breasts on the bone, carefully cut between the breasts and backbone to separate the front and back of the bird., Slice between the breasts on the bone to separate, then use the heel of the knife to cut across each breast through the bone, leaving you with two large chunks, then slice each chunk into four pieces. Season the chicken with sea salt, black pepper and 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds. Pop the carcass in a bag and put in the freezer for tasty cooking another day – it makes an amazing stock., Put a large non-stick pan on a medium-high heat with 50g of butter. Add the chicken wings, legs and thighs skin-side down to brown in the pan for around 3½ minutes, or until golden all over, turning occasionally. Once the butter is dark brown and almost burnt, transfer the chicken to a plate and throw away the oil and butter left in the pan. This will leave you with tasty sticky goodness at the bottom of the pan, which will give you a lovely caramelly flavour later on., Return your chicken to the pan with another 50g of butter, and repeat the process, turning the chicken for another 3½ minutes, or until the butter is dark brown, then throwing away the almost burnt butter., Go in with the breast meat and another 50g of butter, and return the browned meat to the pan for a final time along with the bulb of garlic, turning the meat occasionally to get an even golden colour., Meanwhile, peel, quarter and add the onion. Finely slice the fennel stalks, stopping when you hit the bulb, finely slice the leafy tops, and cut the bulb into quarters, adding to the pan as you go., Scrape up any sticky bits from the bottom of the pan, then make a well in the middle and add the final 50g of butter., Use a speed-peeler to peel big chunks of lemon zest into the butter, pick in a large handful of sage leaves and add the cinnamon stick. Fry for a couple of minutes, or until the veg is softened, stirring occasionally., Pour in around 1 litre of milk (half of the chicken should be submerged) and scrape up all the lovely sticky bits. Squeeze in the lemon juice. The lemon zest will sort of split the milk, making a sauce which is absolutely fantastic. Reduce the heat, cover with a cartouche (greaseproof-paper disc) and simmer for 50 minutes, removing for the final 20 minutes. Taste and check the seasoning and remove the cinnamon stick., To serve, pull the meat off the bones and divide between plates. Spoon over plenty of juice and the little curds. Delicious served with Parmesan polenta and lemony greens."

Peel and add the garlic, then blitz into fairly fine crumbs., Place the chicken breasts between 2 large sheets of greaseproof paper, then wash your hands., Whack the chicken breasts with a rolling pin or the base of a large non-stick frying pan to flatten them to about 1cm thick. That’s the fun bit!, Now lift up the chicken, pour half the breadcrumbs onto the paper, put the chicken back and scatter the rest on top. Roughly pat them on, then re-cover with the paper and wash your hands., Whack the chicken again, to hammer the crumbs into it and help them stick., Put the pan you used to bash the chicken on a medium heat. Once hot, pour in 1 tablespoon of oil, then fry the crumbed chicken for 3 minutes on each side, or until crisp, golden and cooked through., Remove the cooked chicken to a board, and squeeze over a little lemon juice. Use the thyme as a brush to spread the honey evenly over the chicken (or drizzle over), then slice the chicken 1cm thick. I like to serve it with a colourful chopped salad."

Finely grate in the zest of ½ a lemon, squeeze in half the juice, then add the squeezed half for extra flavour. Just cover with boiling kettle water – get an adult to help you if you need to. Cover the bowl and put aside., Now, very carefully push 3 skewers horizontally into each chicken breast (if the skewers are too long, cut them in half). Wash your hands, then season the chicken breasts with black pepper, squeeze over the juice of ½ a lemon and drizzle with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil., You can cook the skewers on a hot barbecue or in a hot frying pan on the hob. Always get an adult to help you! Either way, cook the skewers for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning regularly with tongs. For the final minute of cooking, grab your rosemary sprigs and use them to brush the honey over the chicken, giving it a lovely sticky glaze., To make a zingy salsa, first clean down your board. Halve, deseed and finely chop the pepper. Peel and finely chop the onion and the pineapple, then pop everything in a bowl, dress with a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, then season to perfection. If you’ve got them, finely chop some fresh soft herbs using the cross-chop method, and add to the mix., Uncover the couscous, fluff it up with a fork, and divide between your plates., On a clean board, use a sharp knife to slice the chicken between the skewers. Check that it’s cooked and if it needs another minute or two, simply put it back on the barbecue., Place 3 chicken lollipops on each plate, and serve with the pineapple and pepper salsa, natural yoghurt, for dipping, and lemon wedges, for squeezing over."

                                                        English mustard, white pepper","Use a large sharp knife to carefully cut down the back bone of the chicken, cutting it in half. Season with sea salt and black pepper., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and sear for 10 minutes, or until golden. Reserve the pan for the cabbage., Meanwhile, chop the pancetta into 1cm chunks, pick in the thyme leaves and place in a large shallow casserole pan with 1 teaspoon of oil. Put it on a medium heat so the fat renders out, while you wash and trim the white part of the leek (save the green for making soup) and the celery. Peel the onion and carrot, then roughly chop all the veg into 1.5cm chunks and add to the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened., Stir in 2 heaped tablespoons of flour, cook for 2 minutes, then pour in the cider. Let it bubble away for 2 minutes or until almost evaporated, then stir in the mustard and stock. Add the chicken breast-side down, bring to a simmer, then cover and cook on a low heat for 1 hour, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender., Meanwhile, for the pastry, put the flour in a bowl with a good pinch of salt. Grate in the cold butter, then rub with your fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs. Pour in 100ml of cold water, mix with a fork, then bring together with your hands until it forms a dough, adding an extra splash of water if needed. Divide into 2 pieces – you will need ⅓ for the lid and ⅔ for the base – flatten with your hands and chill until needed., Finely slice the mushrooms and set aside., Transfer the chicken to a plate and shred the meat (discard the carcass)., Stir the mushrooms into the pan, followed by the shredded chicken and the crème fraîche, mix well and season to taste., Strain the chicken mixture through a sieve over a clean pan to catch the liquid, gently pressing to help it along, and reserve for your gravy. Leave to cool., Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5., Lightly grease a 30cm pie dish with oil. Roll out the larger piece of pastry between 2 sheets of greaseproof paper to just a few millimetres thick and use it to line the dish – allow an overhang. Press firmly into the edges and up the sides of the dish., Fill with the cooled chicken mixture, then carefully roll out and top with the remaining piece of pastry. Beat the egg and brush a little over the edge of the lid then fold over the overhang and press down gently to seal. Egg wash the pie all over, then make a small incision in the centre to let the steam escape and bake at the bottom of the oven for 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden and the pie is piping hot., Click off and discard any tatty outer leaves from the cabbage, then cut in half. Halve the core, then finely slice. Roughly chop the rest into large chunks. Place the chicken pan on a high heat, add the cabbage stalks and fry for 2 minutes, then go in with the leaves and a splash of water and cook for 5 minutes more, or until softened and lightly charred. Stir in the mustard, then add a pinch of salt and white pepper with a splash of water, and simmer for 1 minute, tossing a few times., Reheat the gravy and enjoy with the pie and cabbage. Delicious served with creamy mash."

Dollop the harissa into a large roasting tray, add a splash of vinegar and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Scrub the sweet potatoes, drain the chickpeas and add to the tray, along with the chicken. Give everything a really good rub and mix up, then place the chicken breast-side down and roast for 1 hour 20 minutes, turning the chicken halfway through, and basting and shaking occasionally., To make the slaw, place 2 tablespoons each of vinegar and oil into a bowl. Scrub the carrots and roughly box grate or finely slice along with the apples (core and all) and cabbage. Roughly chop the mint leaves (if using), then toss everything in the dressing and season to taste., When the chicken is cooked, transfer to a big platter along with the chickpeas. Tear open the sweet potatoes and add to the platter, then drizzle over any juices from the tray., Warm your tortillas in the oven for 1 minute. Ripple a little harissa through the yoghurt.

Halve and throw in the garlic bulb, then roughly tear in the herbs and add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Toss well, making sure the sauce gets into all the nooks and crannies of the chicken. Cover tightly with a double layer of tin foil and pop in the fridge for at least 1 hour, or overnight – the longer the better!, Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Bake the chicken, covered, for 1 hour, then remove the foil and carefully drain any juices into a jug – this will be your gravy. Skim off any fat that has risen to the surface and spoon it back over the chicken. Return to the oven, uncovered, for a further hour, or until golden and gnarly, turning and basting with the reserved juices halfway through., To make the slaw, peel the onion and coarsely grate, along with the apple, carrot and cabbages onto a serving plate. Pick and finely chop the herbs, then scatter over the veg and season with a with a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss with 2 tablespoons each of cider vinegar and extra virgin olive oil., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat and toast the peanuts until golden, tossing regularly. Tip into a pestle and mortar and pound until fine. Finely chop the chives., Remove the chicken to a serving platter to rest. Place the roasting tray on the hob over a medium heat. Add a good splash of cider vinegar and let it cook away for a couple of minutes, scraping up any sticky bits from the base and sides of the tray., Pour in the reserved chicken juices with 100ml of boiling water, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes, or until thickened and reduced. Add an extra dollop of hot sauce to taste, then strain the gravy through a sieve into a warm jug., Scatter the crushed peanuts and chopped chives over the chicken and serve with the hot sauce gravy and rainbow slaw.

Using wide tin foil, make the bag by placing 2 pieces on top of each other (about as big as 2 shoeboxes in length), folding 3 sides in and leaving 1 side open., Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7., Tear up the mixed mushrooms. Peel and slice the garlic. Mix everything together in a bowl, including the chicken. Place in the bag, with all the liquid, making sure you don’t pierce the foil., Close up the final edge, making sure the bag is tightly sealed and secure on all sides, and carefully slide it on to a roasting tray. Place the tray on a high heat on the hob for 1 minute to get the heat going, then bake in the middle of the oven for 25 minutes., Remove from the oven, place the bag on a big plate, take it to the table and carefully break open the foil. Feel free to vary the recipe – things like grated parsnip, smoked bacon and red wine also work well."

Add the garlic, ginger and chilli, toss for 30 seconds, then add the chicken and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes more, or until golden., Add all the veg and stir-fry for a further 3 to 4 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the veg is tender but with a bit of bite., Meanwhile, cook the noodles in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions., Use tongs to drag the noodles straight into the wok, then add the soy and black bean sauce and toss to coat., Divide between your plates, scatter over the sesame seeds and coriander, and dig in."

        , (optional)","To poach the chicken, cut the onion into quarters (leaving the skin on), scrub and halve the carrots, trim and roughly chop the celery, halve the bulb of garlic. Place it all into a large, deep pot with the chicken, peppercorns and parsley. Cover with cold water, then add 1 teaspoon of sea salt and place on a high heat. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 1½ hours, or until the chicken is cooked through and falling away from the bone, skimming away and discarding any scum that rises to the surface. Turn off the heat and leave the chicken to soak in the pot until ready to serve., For the mole, halve and deseed the dried peppers, then lightly toast in a dry frying pan for a couple of minutes (being careful not to char them) – you may need to do this in batches. Tip into a large heatproof bowl, cover with boiling water and leave to soften (about 20 minutes)., Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of pork dripping in a large, deep frying pan on a medium heat. Add the sesame seeds, peanuts and almonds, and toast for 5 minutes, or until golden. Remove to a bowl., Add another tablespoon of dripping to the pan. Peel and roughly chop the onions and garlic, then fry with the ground spices for 5 to 10 minutes, or until softened., Peel the plantain and roughly chop with the tomatoes. Add to the pan, along with the raisins and toasted nuts and seeds (reserving 3 tablespoons for serving)., Roughly tear in the corn tortilla and bread roll, then drain the peppers and mix everything together in a large bowl ready for blitzing., Working in batches, transfer the mixture to a liquidiser and whiz until smooth, adding a little water to each batch until you reach the desired consistency. Pass the mixture through a coarse sieve into a large pan on a low heat, with 4 tablespoons of dripping., Coarsely grate in the dark chocolate, stir it through the mole, then  leave to simmer for 1 hour, or until the flavours have mellowed and the sauce is rich and thick, stirring regularly. Have a taste and season to perfection, adding a little poaching liquor from the chicken to loosen., For the corn salsa, preheat a griddle pan on a medium-high heat. Add the corn and toast for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the kernels are scorched and blackened, turning regularly for even cooking. Alternatively, char the corn directly on a gas hob. Carefully slice the kernels from the cob with a sharp knife., Finely zest 1 lime over a serving bowl, then squeeze in the juice of both limes and add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Peel the red onion and finely dice with the tomatoes, slice the jalapeños (deseed, if you like), then add to the bowl, along with the corn. Toss well and leave to one side., For the green rice, dollop the dripping into a pan on a medium heat. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, add to the pan and cook for a couple of minutes. Stir in the rice and cook for a few minutes more, or until the onions are golden and slightly softened., Add 500ml of the chicken poaching liquor or stock, then finely chop the herbs and add to the pan, along with the epazote (if using). Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked., Pull the chicken from the carcass and shred the meat. Bash the reserved seeds and nuts in a pestle and mortar to a chunky crumb., Ladle about 500ml of mole into a clean pan and keep warm while you assemble the enchiladas., Working two to three at a time, brush the outside of the tortillas with a little pork dripping, then flip them over and top each with a good handful of chicken. Fold them in half, pressing the edges to seal., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat and fry the tortillas for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp., Dunk the tortillas into the warm mole, then place on a serving plate. Sprinkle over the bashed nuts, then add a dollop of salsa and a few sprigs of coriander. Serve with the green rice. Delicious!"

Stir through the quinoa., Finely shred the cabbage, pick the remaining coriander leaves, then toss with the salad leaves., Place a griddle pan over a high heat. Peel the pineapple, remove and discard any core, then chop into 4.

Deseed and finely chop the chilli., Divide the yoghurt between four plates, then top with the chicken, adding the pineapple on one side and the dressed quinoa on the other. Toss the leaves and cabbage with the juice of the remaining lime half and a little salt and pepper, plus the chopped chilli. Divide between the plates, then serve."

the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden and nutty., Put the kimchi, gochujang, soy sauce, rice vinegar and 2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds into a blender, and whiz until smooth., Place the chicken in a snug-fitting baking tray. Pour one third of the marinade over the chicken and rub it in to all the nooks and crannies. Roast for 1 hour 20 minutes, or until everything is gnarly and cooked through., Add the honey to the remaining marinade and blitz until combined. Pour half into a small bowl and set aside – this will be your dipping sauce. Keep the rest of the sauce for your glaze., For the buns, cut out 12 x 8cm squares of greaseproof paper and rub each one with a little sesame oil to stop the buns sticking. Pour the coconut milk into a large mixing bowl, then add the flour and a good pinch of sea salt. Start mixing with a fork then get in there with your hands and knead until you have a soft, smooth dough – or do all this in a food processor., Tip the dough onto a flour-dusted work surface and roll into a sausage shape. Quarter it, then cut each piece into three to make 12 even-sized pieces and roll each into a ball. One-by-one, with a rolling pin, roll the balls into 10cm x 12cm ovals. Lay an oiled chopstick across the middle like a hinge, fold the dough in half and pull the chopstick out. Place each bun on a little rectangle of greaseproof paper ready for steaming., Remove the chicken from the oven and turn it off. Spoon over the reserved glaze to create another sticky layer and sprinkle over the remaining sesame seeds. Transfer to a plate and return to the oven to keep warm and tighten up the glaze while you cook the buns., Working in batches, place the buns on their greaseproof squares into a large bamboo steamer and pop the lid on. Place the steamer over a large frying pan or wok filled with 300ml of boiling water and steam for 8 to 10 minutes, or until fluffy and cooked through., For the slaw, scrub the carrots, trim the spring onions and chillies (deseed if you like), bok choi and cabbage. Finely zest and juice the limes into a serving bowl, add a little sesame oil and a good pinch of gochugaru. Finely chop all the slaw ingredients, drop them into the dressing bowl and toss with your hands to dress., Shred the chicken and serve with the coconut buns, slaw and remaining sauce."

Rub the meat all over with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper, then toss., Heat a large frying pan, big enough to hold all the chicken pieces snugly in one layer, and put the chicken into the pan, skin side down. If you don’t have a pan that’s big enough, feel free to cook the chicken in two batches. Toss and fry over a low heat for 10 minutes, or until almost cooked, then remove with a slotted spoon to a large roasting tray or dish., Prick the tomatoes with a sharp knife. Place them in a bowl, cover with boiling water and leave for a minute or so. Drain and, when cool enough to handle, pinch off their skins. You don’t have to, but by doing this they will become lovely and sweet when cooked, and their intense flavours will infuse the potatoes., By now the potatoes will be cooked. Drain them in a colander, then lightly crush them by pushing down on them with your thumb., Pick and bash up most of the oregano leaves with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar, or a Flavour Shaker if you have one. Add 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, a good splash of red wine vinegar and some pepper and give everything another bash. Add to the chicken with the potatoes, the tomatoes and the rest of the oregano leaves. Toss everything together carefully., Spread out in a single layer in the roasting tray, and bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven until golden., Lovely served with a rocket salad dressed with some lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil, and a nice glass of white wine."

oil","Place the chicken in a large, deep pot with the juniper berries and 1 teaspoon of sea salt, then cover with cold water., Pop the lid on and simmer over a medium heat for 1 hour 30 minutes, skimming away and discarding any scum and froth, and reserving any fat that rises to the surface., Meanwhile, make the sauces. For the mustard sauce, mix the mustard powder, vinegar and a good pinch of salt and pepper together in a little bowl, then sprinkle over the reserved herby fennel tops from the chicken recipe., For the fiery horseradish sauce, peel the horseradish and finely grate into a little bowl with the lemon zest, then squeeze in the juice. Stir in the crème fraîche, drizzle over a little oil, season and mix well. Put both sauces in the fridge until you're ready to serve up., Trim the fennel and chop into 8 wedges, reserving any herby tops for later. Scrub and trim the carrots, roughly chopping the large ones, then peel and quarter the onion, and trim and roughly chop the celery, reserving any delicate yellow leaves., When the time’s up on the chicken, tie the herbs together and add to the pot with the bulb of garlic and all the veg, except the peas and broad beans. Cook for 30 minutes, or until the veg are perfectly cooked and the chicken is falling away from the bone., Meanwhile, make the dumplings. Beat the eggs with 5 tablespoons of the reserved chicken fat, then stir in the matzo meal and a pinch of salt and black pepper – the dough should be quite sticky., You want to make about 24 dumplings, so, with wet hands, form 3cm to 4cm balls, placing them on a large tray lined with greaseproof paper as you go. Firm up in the fridge until needed., Once done, carefully transfer the chicken and veg to a large bowl. Pour the broth through a sieve into a large shallow pan (big enough to fit the dumplings in a single layer), then taste and season to perfection., Bring to the boil, then dot in the dumplings. Cook for 5 minutes, then add the noodles, peas and broad beans, and cook for a further 5 minutes., Meanwhile, pull the chicken off the bone in big chunks, discarding any bones and skin, then arrange nicely on a serving platter with all the veg, ladling over a little of the cooking liquor to stop it from drying out. Drizzle with oil, then scatter over most of the remaining fennel tops and the reserved celery leaves., Serve steaming ladles of chicken broth with the dumplings, noodles, peas and broad beans. Top generously with shredded poached chicken and veg. Finish with mustard sauce and fiery horseradish, to taste."

On a large sheet of greaseproof paper, toss 2 chicken breasts with salt, pepper, ½ a teaspoon of sweet smoked paprika and 2 heaped tablespoons of polenta., Fold over the paper, then bash and flatten the chicken to roughly 1.5cm thick with a rolling pin., Put into the frying pan with 1 tablespoon of oil, turning after 3 or 4 minutes, until golden and cooked through., Cut 4 thick slices of ciabatta, place on the griddle pan, and remove when nicely charred on both sides., Squash 1 clove of unpeeled garlic through a garlic crusher into the liquidizer., Squeeze in the juice of 2 lemons, crumble in 40g of Parmesan and add 4 anchovy fillets, 4 heaped tablespoons of natural yoghurt, 1 splash of Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon of English mustard and ½ a bunch of fresh basil. Blitz until smooth, then season to taste., Rub the toasts with a halved garlic clove and cut into soldiers., Quarter 2 red chicory and add to the griddle pan with 4 slices of smoked pancetta to char for a couple of minutes., Roughly slice 2 romaine lettuces and arrange over a large serving board or platter., Scatter over the ciabatta soldiers, halve 10 cherry tomatoes and slice 2 jarred red peppers, then add to the board., Toss the chicory in a splash of balsamic vinegar and arrange on top., Slice the chicken, lay it around the salad, drizzle with the dressing, crumble over the crispy pancetta and snip over 1 punnet of cress., Use a speed-peeler to shave over a little extra Parmesan, if you like."

With your other hand gently separate the skin from the meat of the breast – it's normally connected by a little bit of tissuey-type stuff, and you can either leave this attached in the middle and make two little tunnels either side or you can try to cut away the middle., Sprinkle a little salt down the gaps that you have made, push in most of the chopped herbs and drizzle in a little oil., Push the lemon halves into the cavity along with the bay and rosemary sprigs, then pull the skin of the chicken breast forward so that none of the flesh is exposed, tuck the little winglets under, and tie up as firmly as possible., Rub a little oil all over the chicken skin, scatter over the remaining chopped herbs and season very generously with salt and black pepper. Slash each thigh about 3 or 4 times to allow the heat to penetrate directly., Remove the hot tray from the oven and drizzle with a little oil. Put the chicken into the tray, breast-side down and leaning to one side, then place in the oven. Roast for 5 minutes, then lean it to the other side, still breast-side down. Cook for another 5 minutes, then place the chicken on its bottom and cook for 1 further hour, or until golden and cooked through – the skin should be really crispy and the herbs will flavour the meat– this really must be the best roast chicken. Trust me – it's not fiddly, it's pukka."

Put aside., Drizzle all the chicken pieces with oil, place in a large shallow pan on a medium-high heat, skin side down, to get golden on all sides, then remove to a large platter., Wipe the salt off the aubergines and add to the pan, turning until lightly golden on all sides. Remove the aubergines to the platter and reduce the heat under the pan to low., Peel and slice the garlic, prick the chillies and place both in the pan with the cinnamon, woody herbs and capers., Stir and fry for a couple of minutes while you peel and finely slice the onions, then stir them into the pan, too. Cook for 15 minutes, or until starting to caramelize, stirring occasionally., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Squeeze the tomatoes in a bowl of water to remove the seeds – a fine nonna trick to prevent you getting splattered – then tear them into the pan., Put the chicken and aubergines back in, drizzle over any resting juices, then pour in 600ml of water., Sprinkle over the pine nuts, then squeeze over the lemon juice. Cook at the bottom of the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden., Pick over the basil leaves and serve with a nice big bowl of lemony couscous."

Its heart is Indian spices, which were brought through the spice trade to Britain, where we manufactured our first curry powder; then, back again through trade, they went to Japan, along with the French technique of thickening sauces with a roux (fat and flour) – and the katsu curry was born. Katsu was traditionally made with pork, but I have to say, chicken is my favourite. ”",885,30.9g,7.5g,8.7g,1.5g,49.2g,111.5g,3.6g,"4 x

Place them in a bowl, pour over the buttermilk, add the curry powder and a pinch of sea salt, crush in the garlic, then toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight., When the time’s up, sprinkle the breadcrumbs on to a tray. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, shake off the excess, then turn in the breadcrumbs, pressing down to make them stick and flatten them a little more. Keep in the fridge until you’re ready to cook., For the sauce, peel the onion, garlic, ginger and carrot, then finely chop with the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves)., Fry in a large pan on a medium low heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the spices for 15 minutes, or until starting to caramelize, stirring regularly., Stir in the flour, then the mango chutney. Pour in 800ml of boiling water and leave to blip away for 15 minutes, or until reduced to a nice sauce consistency, stirring occasionally. Taste, season and add more mango chutney, if needed., Meanwhile, place 1 mug of rice in a medium pan with 2 mugs of boiling water and a good pinch of salt. Break in the creamed coconut and mix together. Bring to the boil, stir, then put the lid on and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the water has evaporated. Turn the heat off and leave with the lid on., Make a quick pickle by peeling and very finely slicing the red onion. Place in a bowl, finely grate in the lemon zest, squeeze in the juice and add a good pinch of salt. Deseed and finely slice the chilli and add to the bowl, then mix up., Just under half fill a large sturdy pan with vegetable oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go., Carefully lower the chicken into the oil, fry for 8 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, then drain on kitchen paper., Alternatively, drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a large, cold non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Cook the chicken for 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning after 6 minutes and drizzling with an extra 2 tablespoons of oil as you turn., To serve, put a quarter of the rice into a small bowl, press to compact and turn out on to a plate, then repeat with the other portions. Place the chicken next to the rice, cover with the sauce, then sprinkle over the pickle and the coriander leaves."

ginger, deseed the chillies, then slice it all with the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves). Place it all in a large ovenproof pan on a medium heat and char for 1 to 2 minutes to soften slightly., Tip into a large pestle and mortar, add the remaining paste ingredients and bash to a thick paste (or whiz in a food processor)., Return the pan to a medium heat. Halve the chicken legs through the bone, then place skin side down in the pan with the quail. Cut off and add the partridge and pheasant legs. Remove and discard the partridge and pheasant backbones, then halve the birds and add to the pan., Dry-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until everything is golden all over, then add the curry leaves and 1 heaped tablespoon of the paste. Leave to tick away on a low heat while you prep the aubergines, stirring regularly., Leaving the finger and round aubergines intact at the stalk, cut into quarters lengthways. Cut the large aubergine into thick rounds and slice down into the outer edge of each round to make a pocket. Use the remaining paste to stuff all the aubergines and coat their outsides., Layer into the pan on top of the game – it’ll be snug! Transfer to the oven to cook for 40 minutes, or until the aubergines are tender and the meat is cooked through., Put the pan back on a medium heat on the hob, then pour in the coconut milk and a splash of water. Let it gently bubble away for 2 minutes, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper and sprinkle over the coriander leaves. Delicious served with pickles, salad, rice and Fluffy coconut breads."

and peas in 1 litre of water overnight., To make a marinade for the chicken, peel and grate 1 onion, 4 cloves of garlic and the ginger, then finely slice the Scotch bonnets. Bash the pimento seeds in a pestle and mortar until fine, then add the ground cloves, a pinch of black pepper and a few scrapings of nutmeg., Mix in the grated mixture, stock cube and chillies, then rub all over the chicken. Cover, then marinate in the fridge overnight., The next day, preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., For the rice and peas, peel and smash the garlic, then place in a pan with the pimento seeds, creamed coconut and beans (soaking water and all). Cook on a medium-low heat with the lid on for 1 hour, or until just tender., Place the chicken in a roasting tray and roast for 40 minutes. Meanwhile, mix all the sauce ingredients, except for the thyme, together., When the time’s up on the chicken, reduce the temperature to 150ºC/300ºF/gas 2., Pour the sauce over the chicken, using the thyme to brush it all over, then roast for a further 35 minutes, or until cooked through., Peel and deseed the pumpkin, then chop into 2cm chunks. Peel and finely chop the remaining 2 onions and 4 cloves of garlic, then place it all in a large pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and a few scrapings of nutmeg., Simmer with the lid on for 45 minutes, or until starting to caramelize, adding splashes of water, if needed. Smash half the pumpkin with a fork, then stir back through and season to taste with sea salt and white pepper., When the kidney beans are tender, prick and add the Scotch bonnet, strip in the thyme leaves, halve the spring onions lengthways and add with the rice. Mix well, just cover with water, then pop the lid on and cook on a medium-high heat for 25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked., For the salsa, randomly chop the cucumber. Finely slice the Scotch bonnet (deseed if you like) and tear over the bay, discarding the stalks. Mix with the vinegar, then season lightly and leave for 20 minutes to lightly pickle., Serve the rice and peas with the chicken, pumpkin and salsa. Finely grate over a little extra nutmeg before serving."
Greg Davies' Thai green chicken curry | Jamie Oliver recipes,Baby Thai aubergines & Thai sweet basil,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/64503823.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '8']",In1 hour,"“Greg has always been fond of Thai cuisine, but found a real love for it after gigging there, especially for Thai green curry. Now, the base of any good curry is the paste, so it’s worth the effort to hunt out all the ingredients.

Pound to a powder in a pestle and mortar, then tip into a bowl., Trim the chillies (deseed if you like) and roughly chop with the lemongrass (use just the thick, lower part, discarding the outer layer), then peel and chop the galangal, garlic and shallots., Place it all in a pestle and mortar with 2 sprigs of coriander (stalks and all) and a good pinch of sea salt. Finely grate in the kaffir lime zest, then pound to a paste. Muddle in the shrimp paste, ground cumin and coriander, and white pepper (or whiz everything together in a food processor)., Deseed the red chillies, finely slice at an angle and place in ice-cold water, ready for serving. Slice the chicken into 2cm strips., Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a large heavy-bottomed pan on a medium-high heat. Add 3 heaped tablespoons of the curry paste (save the rest for another day) and a splash of coconut milk, then fry for 30 seconds, or until smelling fantastic, stirring continuously., Stir in the chicken, then, after 5 minutes, pour in the remaining coconut milk and bring to the boil, stirring regularly. Tear in the kaffir lime leaves and simmer for 10 minutes., Stir the palm sugar into the pan and have a taste; the curry should be slightly sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Add the fish sauce and taste again – it should taste well rounded, salty with an underlying sweetness., Quarter the aubergines and add to the pan to cook for 2 to 3 minutes (regular aubergines will take quite a bit longer, so cook until tender), then turn off the heat., Pick and stir in most of the Thai basil, then drain the chilli and sprinkle over with the remaining Thai basil and coriander. Delicious served with jasmine rice."

               free-range eggs","Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Place all the birds in a large roasting tray. Strip the thyme and half the rosemary leaves into a pestle and mortar, then bash up with the bay, juniper berries, a pinch of sea salt and ½ a tablespoon of black pepper., Muddle in 6 tablespoons of oil, then rub all over the birds. Roast for 1 hour., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion, carrots and celery. Wash, trim and finely slice the white part of the leeks (save the green for making stock or soup) and the bacon. Peel the potatoes and cut into 2cm chunks., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large pan on a medium heat, add the bacon to render out the fat, then strip in the remaining rosemary. Once golden, add the onion, carrots, celery and leeks, then cook for 45 minutes on a medium-low heat, or until softened, stirring occasionally and adding the potatoes halfway through., For the pastry, put the flour and a good pinch of salt into a bowl with the suet, cube and add the butter, then use your thumbs and forefingers to rub the fat into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs., Beat the eggs, then, reserving just enough to eggwash the pie, stir into the bowl with 180ml of ice-cold water. Use your hands to gently bring it together into a ball, but don’t overwork it. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes., When the time’s up, remove the birds from the oven. When cool enough to handle, pick all the meat, discarding the skin and bones. Sieve the tray juices into the stock., Reduce the oven temperature to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3., Stir the flour into the veg for 1 minute, then pour in the cider and cook for 10 minutes, or until slightly reduced., Shred the meat and stir into the veg pan, then add the stock. Season well, bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes, or until thickened., Carefully drain the liquid through a coarse sieve into a pan, skimming away any fat from the surface. Leave to cool., Grease the bottom of a pie dish (25cm x 30cm) with a little oil. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry on a clean flour-dusted surface to ½cm thick and use it to line the pie dish., Stir 300ml of the strained gravy through the meat and spoon into the dish. Eggwash the edges., Roll out the remaining pastry to ½cm thick and a little bigger than the pie dish, then carefully place on top of the pie, trimming off any overhang. Pinch the edges to seal and make two small incisions in the centre for the steam to escape. Use any spare pastry to decorate the pie, if you like., Eggwash the top, then bake at the bottom of the oven for 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden and the pie is piping hot., To serve, reheat the remaining gravy, skimming off any fat from the surface, and serve alongside the pie. Delicious with creamy mashed potato and seasonal mustardy dressed greens."

the apple juice, sea salt, thyme and bay leaves. Crumble in the dried chillies and bring to the boil, then turn the heat off, top up with 1 litre of cold water and leave to cool., Use a sharp knife to carefully cut down the back of the chicken so you can open it out flat, then add to the cooled brine (transfer to a bigger container, if needed). Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, then drain and pat dry with kitchen paper., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Roughly tear the sourdough into big chunks, break up the garlic bulb, and put aside. Rub 1 tablespoon of olive oil all over the chicken and place it directly on the bars of the oven, skin side up, with a large tray underneath to catch the juices., Roast for 30 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 160ºC/325ºF/gas 3., Add the sourdough and unpeeled garlic cloves to the tray and carefully toss to coat in the juices. Roast for 1 hour, or until the chicken is golden and cooked through, tossing the croutons occasionally. Leave the chicken to rest for 30 minutes before carving., Meanwhile, drain the anchovies (saving the oil) and halve lengthways, then arrange on a plate in a criss-cross fashion. Finely chop the parsley stalks (reserving the leaves), finely slice or chop the chillies, and scatter both over the anchovies., Drizzle over ½ a tablespoon each of the reserved anchovy oil and extra virgin olive oil, then finely grate over half the lemon zest and squeeze over half the juice. Leave to marinate., For the Caesar dressing, finely grate the Parmesan into a bowl, add the mustard, Worcestershire sauce and yoghurt, and whisk to combine. Squeeze in the lemon juice, add 8 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and mix again. Taste and season to perfection, loosening with a splash of water, if needed., Trim the lettuces and radishes and scrape a fork down the sides of the cucumber. Finely slice the radishes, cucumber, parsley leaves and chives, roughly chop the lettuces, and place everything in a large bowl., Add half the croutons to the salad, pour over half the dressing and toss together, then use a speed-peeler to shave over a little Parmesan. Arrange the chicken and remaining croutons on a board, then serve it all up with the anchovies and extra dressing. Let everyone dig in."

Have fun with it. ”",579,18.7g,3.4g,5.5g,1.4g,45.5g,60.7g,4.3g,"30                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                unsalted peanuts, 2 x 120                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                free-range skinless chicken breasts, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                black bean sauce, 150                                                                                                                                                                g medium                                                                                                                                                                free-range egg noodles, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                tenderstem broccoli","Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat and toast the peanuts as it heats up, tossing regularly, then remove and set aside, leaving the pan on the heat., Meanwhile, score the chicken lengthways at 1cm intervals, going about halfway through., In a bowl, toss the chicken with 1 tablespoon each of olive oil, red wine vinegar and black bean sauce to coat.

half the lime juice., Peel and finely slice the onion, then trim and deseed the peppers. Slice the peppers and the chicken breasts into 1cm strips., Add the onion, pepper and chicken to the bowl of spices with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and toss to coat. Leave to marinate while you make the mole sauce., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a pan over a medium heat. Finely chop the tomatoes and add to the pan, followed by the chipotle paste and spices. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then pour in 200ml of hot water. Cook for a further 10 minutes, or until thickened, mashing the tomatoes to make a smoother sauce., Remove from the heat and finely grate in the chocolate, stir until melted, then set aside for later. Wrap the tortillas in tin foil and put to one side., Pour 1 tablespoon of oil into a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the chicken and veg and fry for 6 minutes, or until cooked through, turning halfway. You may need to do this in batches., Meanwhile, pop the parcel of tortillas into a low oven for 5 minutes to warm through. Cut the remaining lime half into wedges, pick and finely chop the coriander leaves, and put the yoghurt into a little bowl., Remove the tortillas from the oven, and build the fajitas: take a wrap, spoon over some mole sauce and top with chicken and veg. Spoon over some yoghurt, scatter over a few coriander leaves and squeeze over a little lime juice. Nice served with a dollop of fresh guacamole."

sauce, peel and crush the garlic, peel and very finely grate the ginger and add to a pan with the remaining ingredients. Place over a medium-high heat until beginning to bubble; reduce the heat and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, or until thickened and syrupy. Remove from the heat and set aside., Prepare your deep-fat fryer if you have one. Otherwise, pour the vegetable oil into a large pot, to no higher than 5cm below the rim, and use a thermometer. Place over a medium-high heat and, using a thermometer to guide you, bring the oil to 150ºC., Meanwhile, combine the flours, baking powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper and 2 teaspoons of sea salt in a bowl. Add the chicken, toss to coat, then gently shake off any excess. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook, in batches, for 12 minutes. Remove and drain on kitchen paper., Increase the temperature of the oil to 185ºC. Return the chicken to the oil, in batches again, and fry for 6 more minutes, until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain as before., Reheat the sauce, if necessary, then gently toss with the chicken to coat completely. Serve the sticky wings piled up with the sesame seeds and thinly sliced chives scattered over."

Cook for 6 minutes, or until golden, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, place the mushrooms in the dry pan, tearing up any larger ones. Let them toast and get nutty for 4 minutes, then tip into the chicken pan and strip in half the thyme leaves., Remove the pan from the heat, add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then stir in 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar and 150ml of water., Working quickly, roll out the pastry so it’s 2cm bigger than the pan, then place it over the filling, using a wooden spoon to push it into the edges., Very lightly criss-cross the pastry, then brush with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Poke the remaining thyme sprigs into the middle of the pie., Bake at the bottom of the oven for 15 minutes, or until golden and puffed up. Easy!"

Peel the garlic, deseed and roughly chop the chillies, finely grate the zest of 1 lemon and place in a pestle and mortar. Add a pinch of sea salt and pound to a paste., To make the dressing, squeeze the juice of the zested lemon into a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of oil, season with salt and black pepper and put in the fridge until needed., Place the chicken wings and prawns on a tray and rub all over with half of the oregano paste, making sure you get it into all the nooks and crannies. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge overnight., Soak the wooden skewers in water before use – this will prevent them from catching on the barbecue., When you're ready to cook, preheat the oven to 160ºC/325ºF/gas 3, then prepare the barbecue., Carefully place the chicken wings onto the wooden skewers; start at the wing tip and push the meat onto the skewer. Do the same with the prawns; start with the head, pushing the skewer all of the way along the body. Pop the prawns back into the fridge., Place the chicken wings on a large baking tray and cook for 1 hour, or until cooked through., Cut the courgettes into 3cm chunks, then slide them onto the remaining skewers. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil and season with salt and pepper., Remove the dressing from the fridge and let it come up to room temperature., When the coals of your barbecue are glowing and the flames have died down, place the skewers on the grill and cook until golden – this should take about 3 minutes on each side., Serve on a platter, drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle over the reserved oregano. Serve with lemon wedges."

Cook for 5 minutes, or until sealed on all sides., Trim and add the carrots, sprinkle in the flour and cook for a couple of minutes, then pour in the stock and crème fraîche. Stirring constantly, bring to the boil and let it simmer and thicken for a few minutes. Pick, chop and add the tarragon leaves., Pour the pie filling onto an ovenproof dinner plate (about 26cm in diameter). Beat the egg and use it to brush the edges of the plate., Roll out the pastry to the thickness of a £1 coin and top the pie, pressing down firmly around the edges to seal. Brush with beaten egg and place in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the chicken is cooked through., Meanwhile, trim and slice the runner beans into 1cm diagonal strips. Cook the peas in a pan of boiling salted water for 2 to 3 minutes, then add the runner beans. Cook for a couple more minutes, then drain, season and serve with your pie."

Toss in 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil, season well and roast for 45 minutes., Remove the tray from the oven. Carefully squeeze the roasted lemon wedges over everything, squashing down some of the potatoes so they burst – this gives you a bigger surface area so they soak up lots of flavour and get nice and crispy., Add the olives, give everything a stir and roast for another 15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are golden., Remove from the oven and serve – this is delicious with a handful of watercress on the side."

teaspoon of cornflour until smooth. Chop the pineapple and peaches into bite-sized chunks and put aside., Pull off the chicken skin, lay it flat in a large, cold frying pan, place on a low heat and leave for a few minutes to render the fat, turning occasionally. Once golden, remove the crispy skin to a plate, adding a pinch of sea salt and five-spice., Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 3cm chunks and place in a bowl with 1 heaped teaspoon of five-spice, a pinch of salt, 1 teaspoon of cornflour and half the lime juice. Peel, finely chop and add 1 clove of garlic, then toss to coat., Next, prep the veg: trim and roughly slice the asparagus and broccoli at an angle, leaving the pretty tips intact. Peel the onion, cut into quarters and break apart into petals, then peel the remaining clove of garlic and finely slice with the chillies. Deseed and roughly chop the peppers, then peel and matchstick the ginger., Place the frying pan on a high heat and cook the chicken for 5 to 6 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway, then leave on a low heat., Meanwhile, place a wok on a high heat and scatter in the pepper and onion to scald and char for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of oil, followed by the peaches, pineapple, ginger, garlic, most of the chillies, the baby sweetcorn, asparagus and broccoli., Stir-fry for 3 minutes, then pour in the sauce. Cook for just a few minutes – you want to keep the veg on the edge of raw – adding a good splash of boiling water to loosen the sauce, if needed., Drizzle the honey into the chicken pan, turn the heat back up to high, and toss until sticky and caramelized. Plate up the veg and top with the chicken. Clank up the reserved crispy skin, and scatter over with the remaining chilli., Pick over the coriander leaves and serve right away, with lime wedges for squeezing over. Good with classic fluffy rice."

chunks. Trim, halve and wash the leeks, then finely slice. Roughly chop the bacon. Chop all the chicken meat into 3cm chunks, Tie the herb sprigs together with string to make a bouquet garni., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan on a medium heat, add the chicken and bacon, then cook for a few minutes, or until lightly golden. Add the onion, carrot potatoes and leeks, then cook for a further 15 minutes, or until softened , stirring occasionally., Next, add a knob of butter, then stir through the flour to coat., Gradually pour the chicken stock into the pan, then stir in the English mustard, creme fraiche, and the bouquet garni, and continue cooking for 10 minutes, stirring regularly. Season with white pepper., Meanwhile, make your pastry. Chop the butter into cubes, then put into a bowl with the flour, suet and a good pinch of salt. Use your thumbs and forefingers to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles cornflake shapes., Lightly stir in 100ml of cold water, then use your hands to gently pat and push together into a rough dough. Do not overwork it. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and put in the fridge until needed., Meanwhile, for the meatballs, pick and finely chop the sage, season with salt and pepper, then using you hands, scrunch and mix with the veal. Roll into 3cm balls, then gently place into a large pan with a splash of oil and cook for 10 minutes, or until golden., Add the filling to a large oval pie dish (roughly 25cm x 30cm), discarding the bouquet garni, then leave to cool slightly, then dot the balls on top., Roll out the pastry on a flour-dusted surface so it’s slightly bigger than your pie dish. Beat the egg, then brush over the edge of the pie dish, drape over the pastry, press lightly to stick, then trim away the excess, pinching or crimping with a fork to seal., Eggwash the top, then use the excess pastry to decorate the top of the pie, if you like., Bake in the oven for around 50 minutes, or until golden, then leave to stand for 10  minutes before serving with some steamed, seasonal greens."

Place in a blender with the toasted spices and coriander (reserving a few nice leaves in a bowl of cold water for later)., Add the peanut butter, soy sauce, the green parts of the spring onions, the zest of 2 limes and the juice of 3. Blitz until almost smooth, loosening with a few splashes of water, if needed, then taste and season to perfection., Cut each chicken thigh into 4 pieces and toss with half the satay sauce. Divide and thread onto 4 skewers and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight., If you’re using a barbecue, get it going 1 hour before you want to cook. If you’re using a griddle pan, cut your wooden skewers to fit and preheat the pan., Get a garnish plate together – drain the coriander leaves, finely slice the whites of the spring onions, finely slice the remaining chillies and wedge up the remaining lime. Toast the peanuts in a dry pan until golden, then crush and add to the plate., When you’re ready to cook, oil and lightly season the chicken on both sides, then place on your medium-hot barbecue or griddle pan. Cook for around 15 minutes, or until beautifully gnarly and golden, turning regularly., Serve on a platter with the rest of the sauce on the side. Sprinkle over the garnishes and slice up some nice ripe wedges of watermelon or pineapple to serve on the side – heavenly."

Leave to one side for about 5 minutes – the mushrooms will have soaked up some of the liquid and be nice and rehydrated., Strain through a fine sieve, reserving the liquid, then roughly chop., Place a pan over a medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Peel and finely slice to the garlic, pick the thyme leaves and add both to the pan when the oil is hot., Once it begins to colour, tear in the fresh and rehydrated mushrooms along with the soaking liquid. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until all cooked down with a beautiful rich flavour, stirring continuously., Remove from the pan and briefly blitz in a food processor or roughly chop on a board. Leave to cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a bowl., Roughly chop the butter into cubes and add to the mushroom mix (it will start to melt a little with the heat)., Pick the parsley leaves and roughly chop, then stir through the mushrooms, with 1 teaspoon of truffle oil and a good pinch of sea sat and black pepper., Peel and roughly chop the onion into wedges. Trim the celery and fennel, then chop the celery into 3cm chunks and cut the fennel into wedges. Add the veg to a large roasting tray along with the tomatoes and wine., To prep the chicken, carefully place a rubber spatula under the skin – the easiest way to do this is from behind the neck. Gently push the spatula under the skin from the front, working your way across while moving towards to the back. Once you have created the space, carefully stuff (or pipe) the mushroom filling into it, massaging on the outside and pushing it in an even layer across the underside of the skin., Place the chicken in the tray on top of the veg, drizzle over 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season generously. Roast for 1 hour 40 minutes, or until cooked through, but check after 1 hour 30 minutes. Cover with tin foil for the last 20 minutes if it is getting too much colour., Leave to rest for 10 minutes.

Season with sea salt and black pepper and squeeze in half of the lime juice. Peel, finely slice and add the onion, drizzle in 1 tablespoon of oil, then mix everything well and set aside., Shred the chicken and place a large mixing bowl. Spoon in the mayo and yoghurt, then finely grate in the lime zest. Destone the olives, then finely chop and add to the chicken along with the raisins., Slice the ends off the apples and discard, then finely slice the apple into rounds, either with a mandolin (use the guard!) or a sharp knife. Toss with the watercress and squeeze over the remaining lime juice., To assemble your subs, open up the rolls and evenly spread with the tomato salsa. Spoon over the chicken and top with the sliced apple and watercress. Top with the crisps, if using, and squeeze together with the roll top. If you’re using two large subs, cut them in half.

the onions, garlic and ginger, then finely chop the chilli. Pick the coriander and parsley leaves and set aside, then finely slice the stalks. Halve and deseed the peppers and cut into thin strips., Place a large casserole or saucepan over a medium-low heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the chopped veg and sliced herb stalks and sauté for 10 minutes, or until softened but not coloured., Meanwhile, chop the tomatoes, then blitz with the dried shrimp in a food processor until it forms a paste., Cut the chicken into 1cm strips, then add to the pan. Turn up the heat slightly and fry for 2 to 3 minutes., Add the tomato and shrimp paste, paprika and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Fry for 3 to 4 minutes before adding the tinned tomatoes and coconut milk. Stir it all together, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of the spoon, then gently bring the stew to the boil., As soon as it starts to bubble, pop a lid on the pan – leaving it slightly ajar – and reduce the heat to low. Leave it to tick away for around 25 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and everything is rich and reduced slightly., Cook the rice according to the packet instructions. Roughly chop the cashews, peanuts and herb leaves., Once the xim xim is ready, stir through the nuts and herbs, and serve up the stew alongside the steaming hot rice."

Add the onion, garlic, celery and coriander stalks, then sauté for about 10 minutes, or until the veg is softened but not coloured., Add the cumin and cayenne to the pan and fry for a further minute. Stir in the black beans, along with their liquid, and the chicken stock., Cut the corn from the cob and add it all to the pan, along with the bay leaf. Gently bring it all to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 15 minutes., If you prefer your chowder to be on the smooth side, you could blitz it just a little with a stick blender, otherwise just leave it nice and chunky., Shred the chicken and add it to the pan with the cream. Season with sea salt and black pepper to taste, then return to the hob for a further 10 minutes., Toast the corn tortillas in a hot, dry frying pan until lightly golden. Cut them into large pieces and serve them wedged into bowls of the soup, finished with the reserved coriander leaves and wedges of lemon for squeezing over."

centimetres apart, and sprinkle with the paprika and cumin. Pick over the thyme leaves and cover with another sheet of greaseproof paper., Using a heavy pan or a rolling pin, bash the chicken breasts to flatten them out to an even thickness all over., Place a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat and scatter in the pumpkin seeds. Toast for a few minutes until they’re golden and start to ‘pop’. Remove from the pan and set aside., Return the pan to the hob, drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil and, once hot, pop in the chicken, seasoned-side down. Fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden. Flip over and cook for a further 2 minutes, or until golden and cooked through., Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of honey, cook for further 1 minute, then remove from the pan and place on a chopping board until cool enough to handle., Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the mango. Drain the hearts of palm and chop up with the mango and cooled chicken., Halve the avocados and scoop out the flesh onto the board, then top with the lettuce and rocket. Run your knife through everything a couple of times until it is all chopped and mixed together., Squeeze over the lime juice, season well with sea salt and black pepper, then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Toss it all together, then scoop the salad into a serving bowl or platter., Crumble over the feta, sprinkle with the toasted pumpkin seeds and snip over the cress."

Finely grate over the zest from 1 lemon, then just cover with boiling kettle water. Pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up., Once done, remove the asparagus to the plate, crumble 20g of flaked almonds into the pan to toast until lightly golden, then remove., Use the base of a pan to flatten the thicker side of 2 chicken breasts slightly, then use three wooden skewers to pierce each chicken breast at regular intervals. Sprinkle both breasts with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and rub with 1 teaspoon of oil., Place the chicken breasts in the pan for 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, but still juicy, turning every couple of minutes, and returning the asparagus to the pan for the last minute to warm through., Meanwhile, mix 2 heaped of teaspoons sun-dried tomato paste with 2 tablespoons of yoghurt and half the lemon juice until smooth. Fluff up the couscous, squeeze over the remaining lemon juice, then pick, finely chop and stir in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh mint.

Add the garlic and rosemary leaves to the tray., Drizzle with oil, season with sea salt and black pepper, then toss well and spread out in an even layer., Rub the chicken all over with a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of oil. Stuff the chicken cavity with the whole lemon and the thyme sprigs. Place the chicken in the tray, on top of the vegetables., Reduce the oven temperature to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6, then add the chicken and roast for 45 minutes., Carefully remove the tray from the oven, use tongs to turn the vegetables over, then spoon any juices from the tray over the chicken., Return the tray to the oven for a further 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. To check, pierce a chicken thigh with the tip of a sharp knife – if the juices run clear, it’s done. Otherwise return the tray to the oven, cook for a little while longer and repeat the test., Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a board and return the vegetables to the oven for a final 5 minutes to crisp up, if needed., Cover the chicken with a layer of tin foil and a tea towel, then leave to rest for 10 to 15 minutes., Using a sharp carving knife, carve up the chicken, then serve with the roasted veg.

Place with the whole chicken into a large deep pan and fill with enough cold water to cover the chicken., Slowly bring to the boil, then turn it down to a simmer. Skim the froth from the surface every so often., Allow it to bubble away for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the chicken is delicious, soft and starting to come away from the bone., To make the tortellini, add the pasta flour and eggs to a food processor along with a little sea salt. Blitz until everything comes together into a dough. If its too dry, add a splash of stock or water., Tip the dough onto a floured surface and knead for a few minutes. Wrap in clingfilm and allow to rest until you are ready for it., Carefully remove the chicken from the broth. Pull the meat from the chicken. Carefully take the breasts from the bird – they will come away very easily – and put to one side. Pull all of the remaining meat from the carcass and shred it for your pasta filling., Add to a bowl. Pick, chop and add the tarragon (saving some of the leaves for later) along with a generous grating of Parmesan. Season with salt and black pepper, and allow to cool., Return the broth to the heat and bring it to the boil. Trim, roughly chop and add the carrots and fennel, then simmer for 15 minutes., Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Lightly dust a tray with flour., Use a pasta machine (or floured rolling pin) to roll out 1 piece (covering the rest with clingfilm or a tea towel) into a long, very thin 10cm-wide strip. Slice into 5cm squares., Place 1 teaspoon of the chicken filling in the middle of a pasta square, then fold the pasta into a triangle, pressing the edges to seal., Wind the folded edge around the tip of your middle finger and press the ends to form a ring. Place on the floured tray., Continue until you have used all the rolled-out dough, then repeat with the rest of the dough., Get the broth to a rolling boil and add the peas and broad beans, and the chicken breasts. Chop the asparagus into 1cm pieces and add those too, followed by your tortellini. You will know when they are done because after a few minutes the tortellini will float to the surface., Divide the carrot and fennel between the serving bowls. Use two forks to shred the chicken breasts and share the meat between the bowls, along with the tortellini, peas and beans., Ladle over the broth and serve topped with tarragon leaves and fine gratings of Parmesan."

Season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, gather up the sides of the foil to make a big bowl, add a splash of water then scrunch all of the edges of the foil to make a parcel., Pop the parcel onto a baking tray and cook in the oven for 45 minutes, or until the chicken is beautifully tender and the meat pulls away easily from the bone., Meanwhile, make your glaze. Soak the raisins in a cup of boiling water and set aside., Heat a lug of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the garlic, chilli and most of the sliced onion, saving a small handful for later. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until everything is soft and sticky., Tip in the raisins, their soaking water and the tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon., Allow to bubble away for 10 to 15 minutes, or until thickened, then add 4 tablespoons each of the balsamic vinegar and honey. Take your time with it and don’t be tempted to cook it too quickly – it will be worth it!, Season with salt and pepper, then add the mixture to a blender (or use a stick blender) to smooth the glaze. Don’t go mad as a bit of texture in the glaze is good., In a bowl, scrunch up the remaining onion slices with a pinch of salt and a good splash of vinegar and set aside – this will mellow the onions and they will add an incredible sharpness to cut through the sweetness of the deliciously dark, sticky, shiny glaze., Check the chicken wings are as tender as you like them. Heat a lug of oil in a large frying pan over a high heat, pick in the rosemary leaves and fry until crispy, then transfer to a small dish for later., Keep the pan hot, add the wings and fry until golden. Add the glaze and keep turning the wings to coat them (at this point you can add an extra drizzle of honey, if you like your wings extra sticky)., Scatter with the quick-pickled onions and crispy rosemary, then get stuck in! Delicious served with griddled bruschetta, if you like."

onions, then trim and finely slice the fennel., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan, add the onions and fennel, along with the chilli flakes, fennel seeds and cinnamon and cook slowly for 10 to 15 minutes, or until soft and sticky., Meanwhile, add the saffron to a small cup, top up with a little hot water and set aside – this will draw the flavour out of the strands and allow it to mix evenly in the pan when you add it., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a high heat, add the chicken thighs and drumsticks and brown on all sides, adding them to the veg pan when golden., Pour in the saffron-infused water, followed by the tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Fill the empty tin with water, pour into the pan and mix together., Add the bay, finely slice and add the preserved lemons, roughly chop and add the fresh tomatoes and destone and tear in the olives., Season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then leave to bubble away for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken starts to fall off the bone and the sauce has thickened and reduced., Put the couscous into a bowl and just cover with boiling salted water, then pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up., Serve the chicken and couscous, scattered with picked coriander."

trim and add 4 spring onions, along with the unpeeled garlic cloves. Drizzle over the honey and fry until dark, golden and sticky., When it’s all looking good, add the whole plums, vinegar, soy and a little sesame oil to stop everything from sticking. Put the lid on, reduce the heat and let it cook slowly for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender., Remove the lid and allow the liquid to reduce and get sticky, then transfer everything to a board. Let it all cool a little, then shred the chicken and return it to the pan, discarding the bones., On a board, chop up the plums and garlic (discarding the stones and skin), the chilli and remaining spring onions, mixing to create a kind of hot chopped salad. Discard the ginger, then scrape it all back into the pan with the chicken., Place the noodles, sugar-snap peas or mangetout, spinach and tea bag in a pan and cover with boiling water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 3 minutes, then discard the tea bag., Use a slotted spoon to transfer the noodles and veg to the pan with the chicken. Use a little cooking liquid to loosen the sauce, then toss it all together., Pick and roughly chop the herbs, then sprinkle on top. Serve with wedges of lime for squeezing over."

Spring chicken and citrus stew | Chicken recipes | Jamie Oliver,"With fennel, asparagus & tarragon","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/3TiRvISsawYAwqa4Xy7PMd.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['to', '6']",35 minutes,"“This is a brilliant transitional dish. You’ve got the stew element, which is warming, comforting and exactly what you want during the colder months, but there are loads of fresh colours and flavours to remind you what’s around the corner at this time of year. The lemon and egg sauce you stir through at the end is something I first saw added to Greek stews. I know it might sound a bit unusual, but the results will make you sit up and smile.  ”",724,54.4g,12.1g,4.1g,,47g,11.7g,,"1

legs, thighs, breasts and wings., Put a large casserole pan over a medium heat and add 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Season the chicken portions and place in the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, until browned on all sides, turning regularly, then remove to a plate., Meanwhile, prep your veg. Peel and finely chop the garlic and onion. Trim and finely chop the fennel, trim and finely slice the leek and snap the woody ends off the asparagus. Pod the peas and broad beans, then pick the herb leaves and finely chop the stalks., There should be a few tablespoons of fat left in the pan; if you have more, get rid of most of it. Add the garlic, onion, leek, fennel and herb stalks and cook until softened, stirring occasionally., Place the chicken back in the pan, pour in the stock and season with black pepper. Cover with a lid, then cook over medium-low for around 45 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and falling off the bone., Bring the mixture back up to a boil, destone and stir in the olives, peas, broad beans and cannellini beans. When the vegetables are done, add most of the herb leaves, reserving some for garnish., Remove the chicken from the stew and use 2 forks to pull the meat off the bones. Discard the bones, return the meat to the pan, then season to perfection and remove from the heat., At this point, the stew will be delicious, but it’s the next step that makes it amazing. Beat the juice of 2 lemons and the eggs together well, then pour slowly into the stew – don’t let it boil or the egg mixture with scramble – it should just add a gorgeous shine., Stir in the yoghurt before ladling the stew into bowls. Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over each bowl, grate over a little Parmesan and serve sprinkled with the reserved herbs."

Halve the garlic bulb around the equator., Put all the ingredients in a large pan with a pinch of sea salt, then cover with cold water., Place on the hob over a medium heat and bring just to the boil. Reduce the heat to a low simmer, skimming off any scum that rises to the top., Simmer gently for about 1 hour, or until the juices run clear when you pierce the meat., Remove the bird from the pan and bubble the poaching liquid for 40 minutes, or until reduced by about one-third (to add more flavour, you could strip the meat from the chicken and return the bones to the stock, too)., Sieve the stock, then store in the fridge for up to 1 week."

Quarter the plum tomatoes, and pick the coriander leaves., Rub the chicken legs all over with a drizzle of oil and the garam masala, then transfer to a large non-stick ovenproof pan., Add another drizzle of oil and fry the chicken over a medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until lovely and dark golden all over. Be brave and let it get really nice and dark – it will make such a difference to the end result if you get it right at this stage. Drain off any excess fat., At this point, preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Next, add the curry leaves, mustard seeds, chillies, onion and garlic to the chicken. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, then add the tomatoes and white wine vinegar.

Transfer the pan to the oven. Cook, uncovered, for 50 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and falling off the bone., Pop the pan on the hob and reduce the liquid until sticky. Scatter with the coriander leaves and serve with the cooling yoghurt. Delicious with rice or couscous, and a crisp, refreshing salad."

Peel the garlic, onions and ginger, keeping them whole., Place into a very large saucepan with the chicken, bay leaves and parsley stalks. Season well with sea salt and black pepper and add enough water to just cover the chicken (about 3 litres)., Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer for 1 hour., Remove everything from the pan, leaving only the stock. Throw away the herbs and ginger and once it’s cool enough to touch, shred the chicken., Bring the stock back to the boil and add a good splash of sherry, the saffron and a splash of ginger vinegar (if using)., Add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is al dente., Return the chicken and vegetables to the pan and simmer over low heat until they are warmed through."

Pick and finely chop the parsley., Season the drumettes all over with sea salt and black pepper. Place a 30cm ovenproof sauté pan over a medium-high heat, add the oil, then add the chicken drumettes, in batches, and brown well on all sides. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside., Add the chorizo and onions to the pan, and cook until the onions are softened – about 4 minutes. Add the piquillo peppers, paprika and tomato pureé, season and cook until the tomato pureé bubbles., Add the rice to the pan and stir well to coat it evenly with the tomato mixture. Cook the rice for about 3 minutes., Add the wine, stir through and bring to the boil. Once the rice has absorbed the wine, add 750ml hot water or stock, then stir in the peas and half the parsley.

After 15 minutes, they should be really easy to peel, so peel off and discard the skin., Peel and finely slice the onion and garlic, then roughly chop the tomatoes. Halve, deseed and finely slice the chilli, then pick and finely chop the oregano leaves., Heat a little olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and fry for a couple of minutes, then add the garlic, tomatoes, paprika, chilli and most of the oregano. Cook for around 5 minutes, or until starting to soften., Pull the chicken off the bones in chunky pieces, discarding the bones and skin. Add the chicken to the pan with the stock., Tear the peppers into chunky strips, add to the pan and stir well. Leave to bubble away for 25 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced and is thick and glossy., Place the fennel seeds into a pestle and mortar and bash until crushed., Place a second frying pan over a high heat. Slice open the skins of the chorizo sausages. Add a splash of olive oil to the pan and squeeze in the meat from the sausages, then add the crushed fennel seeds., Cook for about 5 minutes, or until dark golden, crisp and smelling fantastic, using a wooden spoon to break up the chorizo, stirring occasionally., Add a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and a generous pinch of sea salt and black pepper to the chicken., Take the pan straight to the table, dollop over the crème fraîche, drizzle with the balsamic and scatter with the crisp chorizo and reserved oregano. Delicious served with warm flatbreads or tortillas, or as a topping for jacket potatoes."

Trim the chicken livers, removing any stringy bits., Heat a frying pan on a medium heat, add a splash of oil and gently fry the pear, onion, garlic, chestnuts and sage leaves for 15 minutes, or until softened., Add the butter, move the veg to one side, then add the livers. Season well and cook for a minute or so, then add the brandy and stir., Cook on high for no more than 4 minutes, so the livers are still blushing inside; you’ll see them plump up. Overcooked, they’re tough, and we want them silky smooth., Tip it all into a food processor and pulse till creamy, but with some texture. Stir in the cranberries, then spread out on a plate and pop in the fridge to cool for a few minutes., Preheat your oven to full whack., Gently push your fingers between the skin and chicken breast meat to create a pocket. Push the stuffing into it, pull back the skin and secure with a couple of cocktail sticks. Drizzle with oil and season well, rubbing it all over the meat., Slice the orange into 6 wedges, then fit as many into the chicken’s cavity as you can – leave enough room for air to circulate – then transfer it to a roasting tray., Place the bird in the oven, then turn down the heat to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Cook for 1 hour 20 minutes in total, or until cooked, basting the chicken and covering the breast with bacon halfway through., When done, transfer to a board to rest before carving.

If your chicken has been refrigerated, let it come up to room temperature., Cut the unpeeled potatoes into 2cm-thick chips, then parboil in a pan of salted water with one of the whole lemons for 4 to 6 minutes., Drain in a colander (remove the lemon and set aside for the dressing), leave to steam dry for a couple of minutes, then shake them around a little to create rough edges – this will help to make them nice and crispy., Massage a little olive oil, sea salt and black pepper into the chicken. Halve the remaining lemon, then rub one half over the bird, before popping both halves into the cavity., Place the chicken, breast-side-down, directly on the grills in the middle of the oven – most of the fat is in the back of the bird, so this will allow the juices to run into the breast and keep all of the meat moist., Position a tray on the shelf below to catch the juices (you’ll need these for the chips), and roast the chicken for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until cooked through, turning the chicken over after 45 minutes to crisp up the rest of the skin., Once you have 30 minutes of cooking time left, add the parboiled chips and thyme to the tray with the chicken juices, stirring to coat. Smash and add the garlic, season it all and pop in the oven to cook, tossing after 15 minutes., Once the chicken is cooked, take it out of the oven and turn up the temperature to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Leave the chips in for 5 to 10 minutes, or until crisped up, while the chicken rests., To make the dressing, halve the boiled lemon and scoop the jammy insides into a bowl. Very finely chop half of the skin (avoiding the bitter pith) and add this too., Pick and finely chop the basil and parsley leaves along with the chives. Add to the lemon with the yoghurt. Stir, season and loosen with a little extra virgin olive oil. Set aside., Reserving the bushy tops, finely slice the fennel, finely shred the cabbage and peel the carrots lengthways into ribbons., Add the veg to a large serving bowl, toss through the lemony dressing, then scatter over the saved fennel tops. Herb tops and baby leaves are delicious here too., Serve the roast chicken with the chips and lemony salad on the side."
