Blitz until smooth, then pour into a large serving dish., Trim and halve half of the sprouts through the root. Place in a large dry frying pan, cut-side down, and char until brown and blistered., Finely slice the remaining sprouts then pile on top of the sauce. Tip the charred Brussels over the top and put the empty pan back on the heat., Slice the bread into 1cm chunks, tip into the pan and toast. Make a well in the centre, peel and grate the garlic into the pan, and then drizzle with olive oil. Give the pan a shake., Grate over the remaining Parmesan, shake the pan, add another drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, then return to the heat, until the cheese is melted., Tip the crunchy cheesy croutons onto the salad and then give everything a really good toss until it’s coated in the lovely dressing. Speed peel over shavings of Parmesan and serve."

Carefully cut the top off the squash and remove all the pulp and seeds. Place in a large roasting tray, cut side up, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, add a few gratings of nutmeg and season with sea salt and black pepper. Rub all over the flesh, cover with foil and roast for 1½ hours or until tender (if you’re using butternut squash, scoop out some of the flesh to make a gully for the sauce all along the length of the squash)., Meanwhile, cut the leeks in half lengthwise and slice. Peel and finely slice the garlic. Place a large pan over a medium heat, melt the butter, and then add the garlic. Once foaming, then strip in most of the thyme leaves and add the bay leaves. Before the garlic takes on any colour, add the green part of the leeks, some salt and pepper, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the white part of the leeks and cook, until starting to soften. Cover, cook for 30 minutes, stirring every now and then. The environment of heat and steam will make them soft, tender and gorgeous., Check the seasoning, then turn it into a super-charged white sauce. Stir in the flour. Add about 375ml of milk and stir until it thickens, then simmer and blip away, until thick and gorgeous., Remove from the heat, grate in the cheeses, then stir until melting and gorgeous. Carefully pour into the squash., Tear the bread into a food processor, blitz into breadcrumbs and tip into a bowl. Blitz the walnuts and then tip into the crumbs and scatter over the sauce., Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden, blipping and delicious., When there’s 5 minutes to go, pick the sage leaves into a small frying pan on a medium-high heat with ½ a tablespoon of oil and fry until crisp., Pick the remaining thyme leaves over the baked squash and decorate with the crispy sage, just before serving. Take it to the table with a big spoon, for everyone to dig in."

Fry for 5 minutes, or until browned, stirring regularly, then strip in the rosemary leaves and stir in the Cajun seasoning and smoked paprika for 1 minute., Go in with the frozen mixed veg and a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden, stirring occasionally., Peel, deseed and chop the butternut squash into 1.5cm chunks, then peel and finely chop the garlic. Add everything to the pan along with the balsamic vinegar, stirring for 1 minute, then add the beans (juices and all)., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Tip in the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of your spoon, then half-fill each tin with water, swirl around and pour into the pan., Bring to the boil, then cover with a lid and bake in the oven for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the squash is tender and the sauce is slightly thickened, removing the lid for the final 30 minutes and adding splashes of water, if needed., Once the time’s up, gently mash around a third of the chilli, until some of the beans are squashed into the sauce, then give everything a good stir. Taste and season to perfection, tweaking with a little balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil, if you like. Pick over the coriander leaves and serve with fluffy rice, dollops of yoghurt and a fresh green salad."
Sarit & Itamar's mushroom sfiha | Jamie Oliver recipes,With caramelised onions & ricotta,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/153135556.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In35 minutes,,,,,,,,,,"3 onions, 500g mushrooms, 2 tablespoons Baharat seasoning, 1 large flatbread, 250g ricotta, PANTRY, olive oil, black pepper, sea salt, extra virgin olive oil","Peel and dice the onions, then sauté in a pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt on a medium heat so they soften – about 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, thickly slice the mushrooms., Once the onions start to stick to the bottom of the pan, add the sliced mushrooms – they will start to let out water and after about 10 to 12 minutes the volume should halve and there should be no liquid left in the pan., Add the baharat, then taste and adjust seasoning, if needed., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Line a 20cm cake or pie tin (or adjust to the size of your flatbread) with greaseproof paper., Quickly run the flatbread under a lightly running warm tap, drizzle lightly with oil, then press it down into the tin, so that the edges overhang the sides., Fill the base with ricotta, keeping 4 teaspoons back to serve, and spread out to create an even layer., Top with the mushroom filling, fold the overhanging sides of the flatbread down onto the filling and brush the exposed bread with a little olive oil., Bake in the centre of the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, then allow to sit for 5 minutes in the tin, before using the greaseproof to help you remove it easily., Slice up and serve hot with a dollop of seasoned ricotta. Great with a green salad."
José Pizarro’s Zorongollo | Jamie Oliver recipes,SMOKY ROAST VEG & SUNSHINE EGGS,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/153135198.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In55 minutes,,,,,,,,,,"3 large red peppers, 2 large tomatoes, 4 cloves of garlic, 4 free-range eggs, 8 small or 4 large slices of bread, PANTRY, olive oil, red wine vinegar, sea salt, black pepper, extra virgin olive oil","Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Arrange the whole peppers, tomatoes and 3 of the garlic cloves in an oven tray, drizzle all over with olive oil, season well with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, and roast in the oven for 45 minutes, or until softened., Transfer the peppers to a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to cool., Once cool, peel off and discard all the skins from the peppers, making sure you reserve any juices. Tear the pepper flesh into long strips, discarding the core and seeds, then place in a bowl with the reserved juices., Peel the tomatoes and pop the roasted garlic cloves from their skins, then add both to the peppers., Using clean hands or a fork, lightly crush the vegetables together to combine all the flavours. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar (not too much), toss together and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Cover and leave to sit while you get on with the rest of the dish (if you want to make this the day before, it can sit overnight and will become even more delicious!)., Bring a pan of water to the boil, add salt (I find this makes the eggs easier to peel!) and boil the eggs for 11 minutes, then cool under cold water. Peel and slice the eggs into quarters., Toast your preferred bread and lightly rub with the remaining clove of raw garlic., To serve, spoon the salad (zorongollo) onto the toast and top with the sliced eggs. Drizzle with some of the juices from the bowl, extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper."

minutes or until tender. Drain the beetroot and set aside to cool for a few minutes, then cut into quarters., Meanwhile, in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat, heat the olive oil and cook the onion, garlic, parsley and basil stems for 3–5 minutes until fragrant and soft. Remove from the heat; do not wash the pan., Put the beetroot into a food processor or blender, add the onion mixture, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Pulse for 1 minute, then, with the motor running, stream in the milk. Blend on high speed until very smooth. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, to loosen., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the bucatini and cook for 9 minutes or until al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving 4–5 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water., Meanwhile, prepare the crispy garlic breadcrumbs. In a separate frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat, add the garlic and fry for 1 minute until lightly browned. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring frequently, until the breadcrumbs are lightly charred and fragrant, about 2–3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside., In the same frying pan used for the onion and garlic, add the cooked pasta and beetroot sauce and stir well over low–medium heat for 2 minutes. If too thick, stir in some of the reserved pasta water., Serve the pasta in bowls or on plates, garnished with roughly torn basil leaves, crumbled feta cheese and crispy garlic breadcrumbs."

Set the aubergine aside, and don’t wash the mixing bowl as you will use this later., Very finely slice the onions and fry in a little oil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they colour. Remove from the pan., Using the same ovenproof pan, spread one third of the aubergine on the base (be careful – it will be hot), followed by one third of the onions, then spoon over one third of the passata. Season with salt, pepper, the remaining dried oregano and scatter over a handful of grated Cheddar, then repeat with two more layers, finishing the final layer with extra cheese., Cook in the oven at 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden., Break the lettuce leaves into the reserved mixing bowl (it should still have a coating of olive oil and seasoning from the aubergines). Toss to lightly season the leaves and serve with the parmigiana."

Set aside until ready to use., Place a large frying pan over a medium heat, carefully cut the tofu into quarters, then cut each piece into four again. Add 1 teaspoon of groundnut oil to the pan, then add the tofu and leave to cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway. Remove to a bowl., Toast 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds in the pan, then toss with the tofu to coat., In a small bowl, mix ½ a tablespoon of cornflour, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar until combined., Peel and finely chop 1 clove of garlic and trim and finely slice 1 fresh red chilli. Peel a 5cm piece of ginger, then slice into matchsticks. Snap the woody ends from 320g asparagus, and slice on the bias., Place a wok over a high heat and add 1 teaspoon of groundnut oil. Once hot, stir in the garlic, chilli and ginger, followed by the asparagus and 150g of beansprouts. Cook for a couple of minutes, or until everything is fragrant and golden, stirring continuously., Stir in the cornflour mixture, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened, adding a splash of water, if needed., Serve the veggies alongside the tofu with some extra sliced red chilli and cooked rice noodles, if you like."

Season to taste., To make the filling, drain 2 x 400g tins of black beans and place in a bowl, season with sea salt and black pepper, then add a few shakes of chipotle chilli sauce, to taste., Crumble in 25g of feta cheese and add 1 splash of olive oil, then roughly mash half the beans and stir back through so you get a mixture of textures. Tear in half the reserved coriander leaves and stir through., Pour half the sauce into your pan and place over a medium-low heat., Divide the filling between 8 tortillas, then roll up into thin cigars, placing into the pan as you go., Pour over the remaining sauce and crumble over the remaining 25g of feta, then bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden and bubbling., To make a quick sweetcorn salsa, char 2 large or 4 small corn on the cob directly over the flame of a gas hob (or in a dry pan) on a medium heat for a few minutes, turning regularly, then slice off the corn kernels and place into a bowl., Drizzle over 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and squeeze over the juice from the remaining ½ a lime., Chop 2 spring onions and most of the remaining coriander leaves, stir through the salsa, then season to taste with salt, pepper and chipotle chilli sauce., Serve straight from the oven, scattered with the remaining coriander leaves, and with a spoonful of sweetcorn salsa and a dollop of yoghurt or soured cream. Nice served with cold lager or tequila!"

Once you have perfected this foundational recipe, the sky is the limit when it comes to what you can do with it — you can add a savoury protein such as my Barley Sausage (page 57 of Mississippi Vegan) or Smoky Baked Tofu (page 164).

Remove 1½ cups of this mixture and transfer to a separate bowl (you’ll add this to the gumbo toward the end). Set both bowls aside., In a large bowl, mix together the vegetable broth, canned tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, wine, tamari, tomato paste, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the oregano, thyme, jalapeño, if using, mustard, and liquid smoke. Set aside., Now you are ready to make the roux! In a large clean, well-greased cast-iron skillet (be sure to wipe out any residue), heat the peanut oil over medium-high heat. Once it’s hot, add the flour and stir constantly with a large wooden spatula, until it is well combined. Reduce the heat to medium and continue stirring until the roux is dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes. The goal here is to toast the flour and oil while preventing the mixture from burning. You do this by moving the flour and oil mixture constantly. If you stop for only a moment, the roux will burn and you will have to start over., Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the larger amount of the onion mixture (not the reserved 1½ cups). Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the vegetables are soft, 5 to 7 minutes., Mix all of the Creole spice blend ingredients together in a small bowl until well combined, then add to the vegetables and mix well. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring frequently, toasting all of the spices. Now you have the base of your gumbo!, Transfer the base to a large stockpot. Add the broth mixture and bay leaves. Mix well and bring to a boil, stirring often to prevent the bottom from burning. Once at a boil, uncover and cook for about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, to reduce and thicken the gumbo., Add the green onions, okra, the remaining ½ cup parsley, and the reserved 1½ cups onion mixture. If desired, add 1 to 2 cups water to loosen the gumbo. Simmer for another 20 minutes. Give the gumbo a taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Feel free to add more cayenne pepper at this point to make it spicy as well., To serve, ladle the gumbo into serving bowls, removing any bay leaves. Add a small scoop of cooked rice on top and garnish with the chopped parsley and green onions."

Whole burnt aubergine | Jamie Oliver recipes,"With charred egg yolk, tahini and chilli sauce","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/126135112.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['a', 'meal']",,"“This is the essence of our food, distilled into a single dish. It is inspired by the first whole burnt aubergine we ever ate, served with a smattering of grated tomato, at a very famous Jerusalem establishment we both love. It has since become a staple at every BBQ, and in our restaurant Honey & Smoke. Burning the aubergine really brings out the best in this slightly bland vegetable. Don’t hold back – by the time you’re done, the skin should be blackened and the flesh so soft it can easily be scooped out with a spoon.  ”",,,,,,,,,"2

Let them scorch all over, turning occasionally, until the skin is charred and the flesh is so soft that it seems they are going to collapse., While the aubergines are cooking, combine all the dressing ingredients apart from the chopped parsley. Separately mix the tahini paste with the water to form a thick whipped cream consistency., Once the aubergines are fully blackened, remove from the grill onto serving plates and slit open to reveal the flesh., Add the parsley to the dressing and mix well. Use half the dressing to douse the flesh of the slit aubergines, then top with the whipped tahini. Use the back of a spoon to create a little well in the tahini and place a raw egg yolk in the centre of each one. Using tongs, carefully remove a hot charcoal from the fire and lightly char the top of each yolk. Return the coal to the fire and drizzle the remaining dressing over the aubergines before serving."

Scrub the squash (there’s no need to peel it), carefully halve it lengthways and deseed, then chop into 2cm chunks., Place the squash in a roasting tray, pick and chop most of the marjoram leaves, then toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Roast for 1 hour, or until soft and caramelised., With 20 minutes to go on the squash, simmer the stock over a low heat. Peel and finely chop the onion and celery, then place in a high-sided pan on a medium heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring regularly, then stir in the rice to toast for 2 minutes., Pour in the wine and stir until absorbed. Add a ladleful of stock and wait until it’s been fully absorbed before adding another, stirring constantly and adding ladlefuls of stock until the rice is cooked – it will need 16 to 18 minutes., Remove the squash from the oven and mash up with a fork – I like to do half smashed and leave half chunky, then stir through the risotto about halfway through., Meanwhile, trim the broccoli, halving any larger stalks lengthways to help it cook evenly. Steam for 2 minutes, or until just cooked but still full of colour, then toss with the lemon juice and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and season to perfection., When the risotto is done, add enough extra stock or boiling kettle water to make the risotto oozy, then finely grate in the Parmesan, and beat in with the butter., Cover the pan, turn off the heat and leave to relax for 2 minutes. Stir, season to perfection, then divide between your plates., Pick over the remaining marjoram and serve topped with the broccoli. Lovely."

There’s no need to chop anything first, as now we’re going to mash it all up with a potato masher into a nice, flat, even layer., Season well with sea salt and black pepper, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until a lovely golden crust starts forming on the bottom., Now we get into the rhythm of the secret to good bubble & squeak. Use a fish slice to fold those lovely crispy bits back into the mash, then pat and flatten everything down again. Let it crisp up again, then repeat the process, and – importantly – keep repeating it over a period of about 20 minutes, until it’s golden, super- crispy and delicious. About halfway through, nick a bit, taste it, and correct the seasoning if you need to. When it’s looking good, you can serve it right away, or you can leave it on the lowest heat for a while – the flavour will only improve., You can serve this any which way you like – let’s be honest, it’s going to be amazing whatever you have it with. I like mine with fried eggs, a little lemon-dressed watercress and a few bombs of Piccalilli. Slices of leftover cooked ham are always going to go down a treat, too."

My Singapore-style fried rice | Jamie Oliver recipes,A proper fridge-raid meal,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/105754193.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",In25 minutes,"“There are so many variations on this wonderful dish – for me, it’s all about sumptuous fluffy rice with tang and seasoning. Classically there’d be some sort of smoky ribs or ham in the mix, but you can use the principle of this recipe to suit what you’ve got in the fridge and, of course, you can go veggie if you want to. It’s brilliant for embracing odds and ends from your veg drawer, and hopefully will help you to eat the rainbow. As with most stir-fries, this one is all in the prep, setting you up for fast and efficient cooking. You can absolutely make more portions, but it’s best to cook them no more than 2 portions at a time. ”",528,18.4g,3.8g,8.5g,1.5g,22.2g,72.3g,6.6g,"150                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                brown or basmati rice, 320                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                crunchy veg                                                                                                                                                                , such as asparagus, baby corn, broccoli, leek, Chinese, red or white cabbage, pak choi, carrot, 1                                                                                                                                                                clove of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 2                                                                                                                                                                cm                                                                                                                                                                piece of ginger, 1                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range egg, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    chipolata, 1                                                                                                                                                                rasher of                                                                                                                                                                smoked streaky bacon, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    fresh or frozen raw peeled prawns, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                tikka paste, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                low-salt soy sauce, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                mixed seeds, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                chilli jam","Cook the rice according to the packet instructions, then drain and leave to cool. If you spread it across a plate, it will cool more quickly., Now prep the veg – chop everything into strips or chunks that are about the same size so it will be a pleasure to eat. Chop asparagus spears into 2cm lengths, halve or quarter baby corn, matchstick the carrot, and shred up cabbage – you get the idea., Peel and finely slice the garlic. Peel and finely chop or grate the ginger., Put a large non-stick frying pan or wok on a medium-high heat., Beat the egg. Put 1 teaspoon of olive oil into the hot pan, then pour in the egg, swirling it around the pan to cover the base, essentially like a thin egg pancake. Let it cook through, then ease out of the pan with a spatula, roll it up and finely slice., Put ½ a tablespoon of olive oil into the hot pan. Finely slice the sausage and bacon, then add to the pan. Stir-fry until golden, then go in with the prawns, garlic and ginger., Stir in the curry paste until everything is coated, then start adding your veg, getting stuff that needs a bit longer in there first like carrots and leek. Keep stirring or tossing and adding the veg until it’s all in there., Mix in the cool rice and stir-fry until it’s hot through and the veg are just cooked., Add the soy, then toss in the egg ribbons., Divide between your plates, sprinkle over the seeds, season to perfection with more soy if you like, and finish with a drizzle of chilli jam. Eat right away – heaven!"

The recipe has been written to be flexible and scalable up to 50 portions. Note: all veg weights are for trimmed, prepped vegetables., Peel (or trim) and roughly chop the alliums., Place a pan large enough to hold all the ingredients on a medium heat with the oil., Add the alliums, curry powder and smoked paprika. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until the alliums are golden and softened, stirring frequently., Meanwhile, roughly chop the veg, keeping any leafy greens (if using) to one side for later., Add the chopped veg (except the leafy greens, if using) to the pan and cook with a lid on for a few minutes, or until softened., Note the liquid level in the pan, then pour in the curry and white sauces, the chickpeas (juice and all, if using) and 750ml of water., Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 35 minutes., Add the reserved leafy veg (if using).

Peel and slice the garlic., Roughly chop the Mediterranean veg., Place a large pan big enough to hold all the ingredients on a medium heat with the olive oil., Add the alliums and garlic. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until the veg is golden and softened, stirring frequently., Add the chopped Mediterranean veg and the herbs, and cook for 15 minutes more, or until the vegetables are golden and softened, stirring occasionally., Use a potato masher to gently crush the veg, breaking down any bigger lumps., Add the lentils and tomato base sauce, and bring to the boil – remember to note the liquid level in the pan., Add 200ml of water and stock cube (if using) and give everything a good stir. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 40 minutes, or until reduced – the liquid should return to the same level as in step 8., Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper. Delicious served with pasta, in a jacket potato, or use as the base for a veggie cottage pie or lasagne."

Peel the onion, trim the celery, then finely chop or coarsely grate them., Put 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 knob of butter, plus the onion and celery into a high-sided pan on a low heat. Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the veg is soft but not coloured., Turn up the heat to medium, add the rice and stir for 2 minutes, so it sucks up all the lovely flavour. If using, pour in the wine and stir until absorbed., Add a ladleful of hot stock, stir, and wait until it’s been fully absorbed before adding more. Cook for 16 to 18 minutes, adding more stock every minute or so and stirring regularly, until the rice is al dente. This means it should be soft and a pleasure to eat, but still holding its shape., About 5 minutes before your rice is ready, stir in the frozen veg to cook through., Now, your risotto needs to be slightly looser than you want it to be, as it will thicken as it sits, so add an extra ladleful of stock. Turn off the heat, stir or beat in the remaining butter and the Parmesan, then season to perfection., Pop the lid on and let it sit for 2 minutes before serving. The most important thing is that the risotto is always oozy., Finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, an extra grating of cheese and, if you’ve got it, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice per portion."

Place on a medium heat, add the bay, thyme and a good pinch of sea salt, then cook until syrupy, folding the carrots back into the glaze to coat. Leave to cool., One by one, lay out the filo sheets, rub with oil, then cut lengthways into 3 strips. Place a carrot at the bottom of each and roll up like a cigar, squeezing lightly to seal (don’t worry about being too neat). Repeat with the remaining carrots and filo, placing them on a baking tray as you go., Brush each lightly with oil, then roast for 20 minutes, or until lightly golden and crisp, drizzling with a little honey and scattering with the sesame seeds for the last 5 minutes., Stack the carrots on a board, scattering over any sesame seeds left on the tray, then swirl the tahini and harissa through the yoghurt and serve alongside."

One at a time, pat out on a 15cm square of greaseproof paper, to just under 1cm thick. Place the paper flat on your hand, put a peeled egg in the centre and mould the mixture up and around the egg to seal it inside, using the paper to help you. As it comes together into a ball, remove it from the paper and press gently in your hands to create the perfect covering – patch up any holes as you go., Place the flour in one bowl, beat the remaining egg in another, then whiz the naan to fine crumbs and tip into a third bowl. Cover the coated eggs with flour, dip into the beaten egg and roll in the crumbs until well covered, then chill., When you’re ready to cook, just under half-fill a large sturdy pan with oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go., Carefully lower the Scotch eggs into the pan using a slotted spoon and cook for 8 minutes, or until golden. Scoop out and drain on kitchen paper., Cut in half and serve seasoned lightly with sea salt and with mango chutney for dunking. Fantastic with salad for dinner, or serve up half as a starter or lighter bite."

Working in batches, grill, char and soften on both sides, then add to the bowl (this may feel like a very unusual process, but trust me, it’s delicious)., Once you've grilled the radicchio, turn the heat off (we're going to use the pan to make a warm dressing). Peel and finely slice the garlic, pick the rosemary leaves and place in the still-hot griddle pan with the pine nuts and 2 tablespoons of oil., Keep everything moving for 1 minute, then add the balsamic vinegar (it'll sizzle and smell amazing!), and pour every last bit into the bowl along with the honey., Toss and massage it all together, seasoning to absolute perfection with sea salt and black pepper., Leave to sit for 10 minutes, then toss through the rocket. Great as a side salad, or shave over a little goat's cheese and serve with hot toast."

Coarsely grate in the paneer and squash (deseed if needed), then peel and finely grate in the ginger. Sprinkle in the flour and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then squeeze over the lime juice. Add the curry paste and 50ml of water, then mix., Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat, then roughly divide the mixture into 4 portions and place in the pan, flattening them out into rough rounds, about the width of the buns (don’t worry about wispy edges, it’ll mean bonus crunch later!). Fry for 16 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning every few minutes. Meanwhile, pound most of the coriander leaves to a paste in a pestle and mortar, muddle in the yoghurt, then season to taste. Finely shred the lettuce, halve the burger buns (warm first, if you like), and puff up the dry poppadoms in the microwave for 30 seconds each., Divide the coriander yoghurt between the bases and inside bun-lids, then break up the poppadoms and sprinkle over. Place a crispy bhaji burger on top of each bun-base, add a dollop of mango chutney, a few coriander leaves and the lettuce, then pop the tops on and press down lightly., Serve with a cold beer and extra fresh chilli if you love a bit of heat (like me!)."

Peel and bash in the garlic, then pound in the almonds until fine., Muddle in 4 tablespoons of oil, finely grate in the Parmesan, then squeeze in the lemon juice. Season to perfection, and tweak to your liking., Scrub and finely slice the potato, trim just the stalks off the beans, then place both in a pan of boiling salted water with the tagliatelle and cook according to the pasta packet instructions., Prep the delicate summer veg as necessary, adding them to the pan for the last 3 minutes. Drain, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water, then toss with the pesto, loosening with a splash of reserved cooking water, if needed., Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, and finish with the remaining basil and a fine grating of Parmesan. Nice served with a crunchy seasonal salad."

Trim the lettuce, click apart the leaves and place a few in each bowl., Pop the eggs on top, pick over the herbs, and sprinkle with the nuts. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over, and extra soy, to taste."

Peel and finely chop the onion and fennel, reserving any herby tops, then place in a large, high-sided pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and 1 knob of butter., Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally, then stir in the rice to toast for 2 minutes. Pour in the vermouth and stir until absorbed., Add a ladleful of stock and wait until it’s been fully absorbed before adding another, stirring constantly and adding ladlefuls of stock until the rice is cooked – it will need 16 to 18 minutes., Beat in the remaining knob of butter, finely grate and beat in the Parmesan, then season to perfection and turn the heat off. Cover the pan and leave to relax for 2 minutes so the risotto becomes creamy and oozy., Divide the risotto between warm plates, place a tomato in the centre with a little sweet garlic and the herby fennel tops, then drizzle over the tasty tomato juices."

Carefully slice at just under ½cm intervals all the way along, putting the veg into a large roasting tray as you go., Peel the garlic and place in a pestle and mortar, strip in the thyme leaves, then bash to a paste and muddle in 6 tablespoons of oil, the vinegar, and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Toss well with the veg, then roast for 1 hour, or until golden and caramelised, turning halfway., Remove all the veg to a board and place the tray over a medium heat on the hob. Pour in the wine and leave to bubble and cook away, scraping up all the sticky caramelised bits from the bottom of the tray., Tip in the lentils (juices and all) and spinach, then stir until the juices have thickened and the leaves have wilted., Season to taste with salt and pepper, ripple through the yoghurt, then present to the table with the board of veg.

to drip through into a bowl, then leave to drain., Peel and trim just the portobello mushrooms, then peel and quarter the onion and separate into petals., Peel the garlic, roughly chop the preserved lemons, discarding any pips, and bash to a paste in a pestle and mortar with ½ a teaspoon of sea salt, 1 teaspoon of black pepper and the spices., Muddle in 1 tablespoon of oil, then toss with all the mushrooms and onions. Marinate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight., When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to full whack (240ºC/475ºF/ gas 9)., Randomly thread the mushrooms and onions on to a large skewer, then place on a large baking tray and roast for 20 minutes, turning occasionally., Push the veg together so it’s all snug, baste with any juices from the tray, then roast for a further 15 minutes, or until gnarly, drizzling over the pomegranate molasses for the last 3 minutes., Meanwhile, finely slice the radishes and cucumber, ideally on a mandolin (use the guard!), and quarter the tomatoes, toss with a pinch of salt and the vinegar, then leave aside., Tip the jalapeños (juices and all) into a blender, then pick in most of the mint leaves and whiz until fine. Pour back into the jar – this will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks for jazzing up future meals., Warm the flatbreads, spread with tahini, then sprinkle over the pickled veg, remaining mint leaves and dukkah., Carve and scatter over the gnarly veg, dollop over the hung yoghurt, drizzle with jalapeño salsa, then roll up, slice and tuck in."

Make a well in the middle, slowly pour in 200ml of cold water, then mix, pat and bring it together., Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 1 hour., After 30 minutes the mushrooms should feel quite soggy, so squeeze firmly to remove as much salty liquid as you can (the mushrooms should end up weighing around 400g)., Peel the swede, potatoes and onion and slice into small pieces, roughly the same size and thickness as a pound coin., Mix the veg with the mushrooms, then add the rosemary and a few generous pinches of black pepper., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Divide the pastry into 8, then roll out into 20cm rounds on a clean flour-dusted surface. Divide up the filling, then scrunch and pile it to one side of the middle, leaving a 2.5cm gap around the edges., Lightly brush the exposed pastry with beaten egg, fold over and press the edges down, then twist and crimp with your fingers and thumbs to seal., Eggwash, then place on a lined baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes, or until golden. Serve with a watercress and apple salad and a dollop of English mustard."

Make a well in the middle, crack in one of the eggs, add 2 tablespoons of cold water, then mix, pat and bring together., Place between two large sheets of greaseproof paper, flatten to 1.5cm thick and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes., Roll out the pastry between the sheets of greaseproof, then line a 25cm loose-bottomed tart tin with the pastry, easing and pushing it carefully into the sides and letting the pastry scruffily hang right over the sides (this will stop it shrinking). Prick the base all over with a fork and bake for 20 minutes, or until lightly golden, then trim off the excess pastry (sometimes I don’t bother as people seem to love the crispy bits)., Halve the asparagus spears, saving the tips for the quiche. Chop and place the rest in a large pan over a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil., Peel, roughly chop and add the potatoes and onions and strip in half the thyme leaves, and cook for 15 minutes, or until lightly golden, stirring regularly., Pour in the stock, bring to the boil, then simmer for 15 minutes. Whiz with a stick blender until smooth, pass through a sieve, then season to taste with salt and black pepper., While the soup is on the go, beat the remaining eggs in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and the ricotta, then grate in the Cheddar and pick in the remaining thyme leaves., Chop and add the reserved asparagus tips, then stir into the egg mixture and tip into the tart case., Bake for 40 minutes, or until beautifully golden. I like to serve the quiche and soup together – it’s a wonderful meal."

very gently apply pressure so that the liquid starts to drip through into a bowl, then leave to drain., Halve the tomatoes, season with sea salt and black pepper, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar, then toss and leave to macerate (this really brings out the flavour)., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Peel and finely slice the garlic, then place in a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat with the fennel seeds and 2 tablespoons of olive oil., Fry for a few minutes, stirring regularly, while you prep the veg, adding to the pan as you go: trim, wash and slice the leek, scrub the potatoes, squash (deseed, if needed) and courgettes and chop into 2cm chunks., Cover and cook for 15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, then remove the lid, tip in the chickpeas (juices and all) and season lightly with a pinch of salt and pepper., Finely chop the preserved lemon, discarding any pips, then add to the pan with a drizzle of juice from the jar, and the harissa. Fry for a further 15 minutes, or until beautifully caramelised, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, cover the sour cherries and saffron with 300ml of boiling water, leave for a few minutes, then add to the pan with the tomatoes, reserving the macerating juices., Lay the filo out flat, then brush all over with the reserved tomato juices. Roughly scrunch, wave and layer the filo into the pan, partly tucking it in at the edges (there’s no need to be neat)., Scatter over the sesame seeds and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Transfer the yoghurt to a plate and drizzle with a little oil from the harissa jar, then serve with the pie."

Peel and halve the garlic cloves and place in the gaps, then season generously with sea salt and black pepper. Cover, turn the heat down to low and leave to steam for 10 minutes to soften the onions slightly, then remove the lid and cook until – very importantly! – the liquid starts to caramelise, gently shaking the pan occasionally to stop it from sticking., Place the pastry over the onions, using a wooden spoon to push it right into the edges of the pan. Bake for 35 minutes, or until golden brown and puffed up (it will look quite dark, but don’t worry!). Using oven gloves to protect your hands, pop a large plate over the pan and confidently but very carefully turn out., Delicious served with goat’s cheese, a simple salad and a cold beer."

flavoured oil, season with sea salt and black pepper, and cook for 30 minutes, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the potatoes, cook in a pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until tender, then drain well. Mash with the butter and milk, and season to taste., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Quarter the onion, add to the porcini in the blender along with the Marmite and tomato purée and whiz until smooth., Pour into the veg pan and cook for 20 minutes, or until dark and caramelised, stirring regularly and scraping up any sticky bits from the bottom of the pan., Tip the lentils (juices and all) into the veg pan, bring to the boil, then season to taste., Spoon over the mash, place on a tray, bake for 30 minutes, or until lightly golden and bubbling at the edges, then sprinkle over the crispy rosemary.

Add the curry leaves, mustard seeds, curry powder and coconut and toast for 1–2 minute or until fragrant. Tip into a food processor and blitz well., Trim the spring onions and add to the food processor. Peel and chop the garlic and ginger and add to the food processor along with the vegetable oil. Pulse until the mixture forms a paste., Peel the beetroots and chop into 2cm cubes. Place the pan back on the hob over a medium heat, add the paste and cook for a few minutes. Add the chopped beetroot. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 25 minutes or until sticky and gnarly, stirring often., Tip in the cherry tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes, before starting to break them up with the back of a wooden spoon. Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the packet instructions., After 10 minutes, or once the tomatoes have completely cooked down, stir in the coconut milk and a squeeze of lemon juice. Increase the heat and cook for 5 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. Season to taste. If you want the curry a little looser, add a splash of water before serving., For the temper, place a frying pan over a medium heat and add the oil. Add all the temper ingredients and heat for 1–2 minutes, until the spices start to pop and smell aromatic. Turn off the heat and tip into a bowl lined with kitchen paper., Pick the coriander leaves and cut the lime into wedges. Serve the curry with the rice and temper, coriander leaves scattered on top and the lime wedges on the side for squeezing over."

mixing bowl. Scrub the carrot and squash, then coarsely grate into the bowl, along with the paneer. Peel the garlic and ginger and finely grate it into the bowl. Finely chop the green chillies (deseed if you like) and half the coriander (stalks and all) and add to the mix., Tip in the flour, turmeric and cumin, season with sea salt and black pepper, then squeeze in the juice of 1 lime. Add 100ml of water, then get in there with clean hands and give it a good mix up. Divide into 6, then shape and squash into 3cm-thick patties., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, add the patties and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp – you may need to work in batches. Remove to a baking tray and pop in the oven for 10 minutes, or until cooked through., For the coriander yoghurt, pick the remaining coriander leaves into a pestle and mortar, setting aside a handful for garnish. Add a pinch of salt, then bash to a paste. Squeeze in the juice of half the remaining lime, then stir in the yoghurt., Finely shred the lettuce, finely slice the red chilli (if using), halve the burger buns., To assemble, spoon a little coriander yoghurt over the base and inside lid of each burger bun. Crumble the poppadoms and sprinkle over the yoghurt, then sit a patty on top of each base and spread with 1 tablespoon of mango chutney. Top with a handful of lettuce, a few reserved coriander leaves and a sprinkling of red chilli, then place the bun lid on top. Serve with the remaining lime cut into wedges for squeezing over.

Score a criss-cross pattern in the flesh of each half with a sharp knife. Halve the lemon (if using) and rub it over the aubergine flesh – this will stop it discolouring., Pour ½ a wine glass of water into a lidded pan on a medium-low heat. Put the aubergine into the pan, , skin-side down, and pop the lid on. Leave to steam for about 8 minutes, or until the pan is almost dry and the aubergine is starting to open up., Chop your tomatoes, halving or quartering the larger ones and leaving any small ones whole., Pound the pistachios to a crumb in a pestle and mortar, leaving a few bigger chunks for texture. Chop the coriander stalks, reserving the leaves for later., When the aubergine water has almost disappeared, add a little oil to the pan and push the aubergines flat with a spatula to crisp up the skin., Add the spice paste to one side of the pan, fry it off a little, then add the coriander stalks and tomatoes, gently turning to coat in the paste. Turn the aubergine halves over and give the pan a little shake. Scatter over the pistachios, then transfer to the oven, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until bubbling and golden. Serve scattered with the reserved coriander leaves."
Veggie bubble & squeak | Jamie Oliver vegetable recipes,"Crispy, gnarly, caramelised veg","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/91994145.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '8']",In40 minutes,"“Bubble and squeak is a dish created out of leftovers and it’s become one of our great British recipes. The first recorded recipes for it were written in the early 1800s, when any roasted shredded meat or vegetables left over from Sunday’s dinner would be fried in the pan the next day to create this big and beautiful veggie patty. But it’s so damn good you shouldn’t have to wait for leftovers to enjoy it, so I’m giving you this recipe as a guide. As long as you use 60% potato, you can make the rest up using whatever you’ve got to hand – vegetables, crumbled chestnuts, herbs, crispy bacon or leftover meat. In the cockney cafés they call this ‘bubble’, and serve it alongside eggs for breakfast. Because it often sits in the pan for ages getting dark and crispy, it tends to take on a fairly dark grey and rather ugly colour, but ironically, those are often the tastiest bubble and squeaks of all. ”",179,6.1g,2.9g,4.5g,0.3g,3.8g,29.1g,4.1g,"1                                                                                                                                                                kg                                                                                                                                                                fluffy potatoes                                                                                                                                                                , such as Maris Piper, 600                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                mixed vegetables                                                                                                                                                                , such as carrots, swede, turnips, parsnips, kale, Brussels sprouts... anything you like!, 40                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter, olive oil, a few                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh herbs                                                                                                                                                                , such as rosemary, sage, thyme or whatever you have knocking about in the fridge","Peel and trim all the vegetables, cutting the root veg into 2.5cm dice., Cook the veg in a large pan of boiling salted water for 10 minutes, or until they are all cooked through., If you’re using swede or turnips, put them in about 5 minutes earlier than everything else as they take slightly longer to soften up.

and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic, and slice 200g of baby courgettes into 1cm rounds, adding to the pan as you go., Halve and stir in 160g of ripe cherry tomatoes, then cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Drizzle 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil into a bowl, then add a good squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper., Prepare the fruit (removing any stones, pips or seeds, if needed), slicing up however you fancy, then add to the bowl with 50g of rocket., Drop the pasta into a large pan of boiling salted water for just 2 minutes, then use a slotted spoon to scoop it straight into the frying pan, letting some starchy cooking water go with it., Pick in most of the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh basil (15g), tearing up any larger ones, then add 25g of pine nuts and a good squeeze of lemon juice., Finely grate over 15g of Parmesan, then toss together and let the sauce emulsify., Toss the salad together,

Tear the cauliflower leaves into the pan, then place over a medium heat on the hob. Pour in 500ml of water, so it’s just level with the cauliflower., Peel 1 red onion, cut into quarters and break apart into petals, then peel and finely slice 2 cloves of garlic, and place on top of the cauliflower. Bring to the boil, then leave to bubble away for 10 minutes., Transfer the pan to under the grill, roughly 5cm from the heat, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until gnarly, charred and cooked through, turning halfway., Meanwhile, cook 150g of basmati rice in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instruction with ½ a lemon thrown in, then drain., Remove the pips and any pith from the cooked lemon, then very finely chop the flesh and rind. Pick the coriander leaves from 1 sprig and scatter over with a few pickled chillies (if using) and a splash of the pickling liquor, and finely chop and mix together. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, then put aside until needed., Remove the cauliflower pan from under the grill, place over a medium heat, then pour in ½ x 400g tin of light coconut milk and bring to the boil, stirring gently to combine – try not to break up the cauliflower slices., One-by-one, puff up the 4 uncooked poppadoms in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute each., Pick the remaining leaves from the ½ bunch of fresh coriander (15g) and put aside, adding the stalks to a pestle and mortar with a pinch each of salt and chilli flakes. Bash to a paste, then muddle in 2 heaped tablespoons of natural yoghurt., Sprinkle the coriander leaves over the curry, squeeze the juice of ½ a lemon into the rice, then serve with the poppadoms, coriander yoghurt and lemon pickle. Cut the remaining lemon into wedges for squeezing over, then tuck in."

Grease the base and sides of an 18cm loose-bottomed cake tin with a little rapeseed oil, and line the base with baking paper., Peel and grate the carrots, beetroot and parsnip into a large bowl. Finely grate the zest of the orange and add two-thirds to the veg (reserving the rest for the frosting) along with the maple syrup, eggs and rapeseed oil. Fold in the flour, spice, baking powder and a pinch of salt., Finely dice the apricots, then add to the bowl along with the seeds. Mix everything until well combined., Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, rotating the tin after 20 minutes, until the top is light pinky-golden and bounces back when pressed lightly, and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin., Meanwhile, to make the icing, whisk together all the ingredients except the lemon, and most of the reserved orange zest, until completely smooth. Squeeze in a tiny bit of lemon juice and whisk in. Cover and pop in the fridge until needed., When the cake is completely cool, transfer to a plate or stand, then finish with the icing, smoothing it all over the top of the cake with the back of a spoon., Decorate the cake with the remaining orange zest, extra pumpkin seeds and edible flowers, if you like, then serve., This cake will keep for up to five days in a sealed container in the fridge."

Drain in a colander and set aside to dry., Toast the cumin and coriander seeds in a small frying pan over a medium heat for 3 minutes, or until fragrant. Using a pestle and mortar, finely grind the toasted seeds with a pinch of sea salt., Tip most of the spice mix into a large roasting tray and toss in the sprouts., Peel and slice the onions, then trim and slice the fennel. Tip into the tray along with a glug of oil., Spread everything in an even layer – you may need two trays – and cook for 20 minutes, until tender and starting to caramelise., Meanwhile, return your frying pan to the heat and toast the sesame seeds and hazelnuts for 3 minutes, then grind up with the remaining spices, using a pestle and mortar., Combine the yoghurt with the tahini. Peel and crush the garlic and stir through, then finely grate in half the lemon zest and squeeze in half the juice (save the rest for another day)., Taste the yoghurt and season well, then spread it evenly over the base of a large serving platter and sprinkle some sumac over the top., Spoon the sprout mix on top of the yoghurt mixture, scraping up the lovely crispy bits in the pan. Sprinkle the ground nuts and seeds over the top., Pick and finely chop the herb leaves, discarding the stalks. Scatter the leaves across the plate, then serve."

I’ve added courgette as well as aubergine to switch things up a bit, but also because courgettes are a source of folic acid, which helps to reduce fatigue.  ”",487,30.6g,9.3g,13.5g,1.8g,20.3g,33.2g,20.3g,"2                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                courgettes, 1                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                aubergine, 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil                                                                                                                                                                , 15g, 1                                                                                                                                                                clove of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, olive oil, 1 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                 tomatoes, 75                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                mozzarella cheese, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried breadcrumbs, 10                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Parmesan cheese, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, extra virgin olive oil, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                rocket","Preheat the grill to full whack and place a large tray on a shelf close to the heat., Trim the courgettes and aubergine, slice lengthways into ½ cm pieces, then place in a bowl. Sprinkle generously with sea salt and toss, then put aside., Pick the basil leaves, set aside and finely chop the stalks. Peel and finely chop the garlic., Heat ½ tablespoon of olive oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat, add the garlic and basil stalks, then fry gently for 2 minutes before adding half the tomatoes (save the rest of another day) and the same volume of water.  Cook for 10 minutes, or until it reaches a saucy consistency., Meanwhile, rinse the courgette and aubergine, then pat dry with kitchen roll. Tip back into a bowl and toss with 1 ½ tablespoons of olive oil, and a good pinch of seasoning., Spread the courgette and aubergine on the hot tray and slide under the heat (you may need to do this in batches, as you want the veg in one layer)., Grill for 5 minutes, or until browned, then flip the veg grill for a further 5 minutes. Keep an eye on the veg as it grills, then tip into a bowl., Taste and season the sauce, then pour over the vegetables. Tear over the basil leaves and mix., Spread evenly on the tray and tear over the mozzarella. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs and grate over the Parmesan, then slide back under the grill. Grill until the cheese has melted., Meanwhile, squeeze half the lemon juice into a bowl, add 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and pinch of seasoning. Mix well, then toss through the rocket. When the parmigiana is bubbling and delicious, divide between plates and serve with the rocket."

Whole Roasted Miso Aubergine | Vegetables Recipes | Jamie Oliver,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/BY25W0We4CD8FEKZgHDOVh.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",,"“I’ve met quite a few people who don’t love aubergine, and I can honestly say most of the time it’s because of the way it’s cooked. That rubbery, dry, slightly squeaky texture is pretty off-putting, but that’s purely because it hasn’t been cooked for long enough. Aubergines are a beautiful thing, and when given the right care they are stunning. Take this recipe, for example – I treat the aubergines like a piece of meat, slashing them, marinating them and slow-roasting them whole. The result is a deliciously creamy and fragrant dish that takes little effort to make. The other bonus is that you don’t use much oil, as you cook the aubergines whole, so it’s light too. ”",124,6.6g,1.2g,6.6g,1.5g,4g,12.8g,1g,"3cm piece of                                                                                                                                                                ginger, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    cloves of garlic, 2                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                green chillies, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    aubergines, groundnut oil, 200g                                                                                                                                                                vine cherry tomatoes, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    spring onion, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                coriander, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lime, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                tamarind paste, ½                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                 honey, 3                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                white sweet miso","Preheat your oven to 180°C/350ºC/gas 4., Peel the ginger and garlic, and finely slice the chillies. Pierce the aubergines all over with a paring knife, as if you were making incisions into a piece of meat., Grate the ginger into a large mortar and pestle, and bash together with the garlic, chillies and a good pinch of salt until you have a thick paste. Mix in just enough oil to make it spoonable, then spoon the mixture over the aubergines and massage it into the incisions, really getting the flavours inside., Place the aubergines in a large roasting tray, dot the cherry tomatoes around, and pop into the oven for 40 minutes, turning a couple of times., While the aubergines are cooking, trim and finely slice the spring onions and roughly chop the coriander, stalks and all. Put into a bowl, squeeze over the lime juice to coat and mix all together. Leave to one side., Mix together the tamarind, honey and miso and add enough water to make a thick glaze. Remove the roasting tray from the oven after 40 minutes, turn the oven up to 200°C/gas 6, and drizzle the miso glaze over the aubergines. Pop back into the oven for a further 15 minutes, to caramelise, then remove and leave to cool a little., Working carefully, remove the stalks from the aubergines and discard them, then roughly chop the flesh in the tray into coarse chunks. Stir in the dressed spring onions and coriander and serve right away."

quality cocoa powder, 1 heaping tablespoon peanut butter, 1–2 fresh red chiles, 3 large mixed-color peppers, 2 sweet potatoes (10 oz each), 1 bunch of fresh cilantro (1 oz), 2 x 15-oz cans of butter beans, 3 x 14-oz cans of plum tomatoes, 8 small baking potatoes, 5 oz Cheddar cheese, 4 little gem lettuces or hearts of romaine, 8 tablespoons plain yogurt","Put a large casserole dish on a medium-low heat and a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat., Prick the peppers, then sit them directly on the gas flame, or under a hot grill, for 10 minutes, until charred (keep an eye on them!). Meanwhile, scrub the sweet potatoes and slice into 2cm chunks (there’s no need to peel them), then char in the hot, dry frying pan for 5 minutes, turning them halfway through., Meanwhile, peel the onions and cut into 1cm chunks, then dry-fry in the casserole dish for 3 minutes until softened. Push them to the side and drizzle in 2 tablespoons of oil, then stir in the cumin seeds, paprika, cocoa powder and peanut butter. Add 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar and scrape up any sticky bits from the bottom of the pan, then stir in the charred sweet potato., Prick the chillies and blacken all over in the hot frying pan or directly over the gas flame. Carefully place the charred peppers on a board, then deseed and roughly chop, adding them to the casserole dish as you go. Carefully remove the charred chillies to a board, then finely chop and add to the mix., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Strain the butter beans in a sieve over the casserole dish, so the juices go straight in, then tip the beans into a the hot, dry frying pan and leave them in an even layer, without stirring, until they start to char and pop, then tip into the veg., Tip in the chickpeas (juice and all) and scrunch in the tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, then pour in 1 tin’s worth of water. Finely chop and add the coriander stalks (saving the leaves for later), season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and stir well, then pop on the lid, leaving a little opening, and cook for 1 hour, or until thickened, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, scrub the potatoes and dry with a clean tea towel. Prick them all over with a fork and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt, then place on a baking tray and bake for 1 hour, or until crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle., For the salsa, peel the onion and thinly slice with the apple, then tip into a small bowl, dress with the lime juice and season to perfection., For the cheat’s chilli sauce, blitz the jalapeños and their vinegar with the mint in a food processor until smooth., When you’re ready to serve, finely chop the coriander leaves and stir through the chilli with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Grate the cheese and click off the lettuce leaves., To serve, cut a cross into each baked spud, pinching the bottoms so they open up, and transfer to serving plates. Top with the cheese, stuffing it in well, then add a good spoonful of the chilli and serve with the lettuce leaves, a dollop of yoghurt, a sprinkling of the salsa and a drizzle of the chilli sauce., Put a large casserole pan on a medium-low heat and a grill pan beside it on a high heat. The idea here is to work in batches, starting by charring the veg on the grill to add a smoky flavor dimension. Peel the onions and cut into ½-inch dice, char on the grill for 3 minutes, then place in the casserole pan with 2 tablespoons of oil, the cumin seeds, paprika, cocoa, and peanut butter, stirring occasionally. Slice the chile(s) ½ inch thick and grill while you seed and roughly chop the peppers and chop the sweet potatoes into rough ¾-inch chunks (leave the skin on for extra nutritional benefit, just give them a wash). Grill it all, adding to the casserole pan as you go. Finely chop and add the cilantro stalks., Preheat the oven to 350°F. Drain the beans in a sieve over the casserole pan so the juices go in, then tip the beans into the grill pan in an even layer. Have faith and leave them without stirring until they start to char and burst, then add to the veg. Pour in the canned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Stir well, then pop the lid on ajar and leave for 1 hour, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, wash the potatoes, prick, then bake for 1 hour, or until crispy on the outside, fluffy in the middle., Just before serving, finely chop the cilantro leaves and stir through the chili, taste, and season to perfection. Cut a cross into each spud, pinching the bottoms so they open up, then grate the cheese and divide it between them, stuffing it in well. Pick apart the gem lettuces, and serve each cheesy spud with a good portion of chili, some gem leaves, and a dollop of yogurt."

Finely chop the rest and add to the jar with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Pop the lid on and shake well to combine., On a large chopping board, chop up the broccoli until fairly fine. Fluff up the couscous with a fork, then scrape the broccoli into the bowl and mix well., Take half the couscous to work with a little pot containing half the dressing and toss them together, scatter with half of the baby mint leaves and crumble over half of the feta before serving, then repeat the following day!"

Fry for a few minutes, or until lightly golden, then crumble in the chestnuts., Fry for about 5 minutes, or until deep golden, then add the onions and sage. Turn the heat down to low and cook slowly for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, trim the Brussels and peel away any tatty outer leaves, halving any larger ones through the core and keeping the smaller ones whole., Place the Brussels in a large saucepan over a high heat for a couple of minutes, then, once the pan is nice and hot, cover with boiling salted water., Boil for 5 minutes, or until just tender but with a little bite. Taste to check – they should be slightly undercooked., Drain the Brussels, then stir through the chestnut mixture, scraping up any lovely sticky bits from the bottom of the pan., Add the butter and season to perfection, then serve right away, or cover and store in the fridge, reheating in the pan when needed."

cheese","Peel and finely chop the garlic and onion. Trim and roughly chop the carrots, celery and courgette, then add the vegetables to a large bowl., Cut the ends off the leek, quarter it lengthways, wash it under running water, then cut into 1cm slices. Add to the bowl., Scrub and dice the potato. Drain the cannellini beans, then set aside.
Finely slice the bacon., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the bacon and fry gently for 2 minutes, or until golden., Add the garlic, onion, carrots, celery, courgette, leek, oregano and bay and cook slowly for about 15 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened, stirring occasionally., Add the potato, cannellini beans and plum tomatoes, then pour in the vegetable stock. Stir well, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon., Cover with a lid and bring everything slowly to the boil, then simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the potato is cooked through. Meanwhile..., Remove and discard any tough stalks bits from the greens, then roughly chop., Using a rolling pin, bash the pasta into pieces while it’s still in the packet or wrap in a clean tea towel., To check the potato is cooked, pierce a chunk of it with a sharp knife – if it pierces easily, it’s done., Add the greens and pasta to the pan, and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente. This translates as ‘to the tooth’ and means that it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of a bite and firmness to it. Try some just before the time is up to make sure you cook it perfectly., Add a splash more stock or water to loosen, if needed., Pick over the basil leaves (if using) and stir through. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, then serve with a grating of Parmesan and a slice of wholemeal bread, if you like."

Separate out the leaves, throwing any tatty ones away., Pop them in a colander and give them a good wash under cold running water over the sink., Spin them dry in a salad spinner, or wrap in a clean tea towel and shake dry, then pile the leaves into a large salad bowl., Pick and add the herbs to the bowl, discarding the stalks., From a height, drizzle 3 tablespoons of the dressing over the leaves and gently toss together with the tips of your fingers until every leaf is coated – try not to be heavy-handed and don’t be tempted to overdress or the leaves will go limp., Have a taste and add a splash more dressing, if needed – remember you can always add more but you can’t take it away, so be cautious.

Chargrill the chillies until their skins are black and blistered all over., Meanwhile, peel and halve the tomatillos or green tomatoes, then peel and slice the onions into wedges. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Pick the coriander leaves, then peel, destone and quarter the avocado., Place the charred chillies in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to sit for a few minutes., In batches, chargrill the tomatillos or green tomatoes and onion wedges until they have picked up some serious char marks and are blackened and caramelised on all sides., Remove the chillies from the bowl and peel off the blackened skin. If you prefer a milder flavour, remove the seeds., Now you have to choose whether you want a big, chunky salsa or something smoother. For a textured, chopped salsa, place the chillies, tomatillos, onions, garlic, coriander leaves and avocado on a big board., Use a large chef’s knife to chop everything, melding all the flavours together, until the ingredients are all about the same size. Mix in the lime juice and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., For a smooth, bottled salsa, blitz all the ingredients in a blender., Drip onto eggs or on crispy chicken. Pour into sterilised bottles and keep in the fridge for up to a week."

Set aside. Peel and finely dice the onion., In a large frying pan, cook the onion in 2 tablespoons of oil over a low heat. After 10 minutes, add the tomato purée, cinnamon, turmeric, cumin, 1 teaspoon of sea salt, ½ teaspoon of freshly ground pepper, the chopped tomatoes and split peas., Pour in about 500ml of water and simmer everything over a low heat for 45 minutes or until the split peas are soft., Spear the dried limes on a metal skewer, then add to the pan and cook, covered, for another 15 minutes. Once the cooking time is up, add the saffron water and stir through thoroughly. Remove the skewer from the limes., Meanwhile, halve one large aubergine lengthways, then slice each half again lengthways into three equal spears. Salt generously and then let sit for 30 minutes.

Roughly chop them and place in a bowl with the onion, tomatoes, cucumber, feta and oregano (if you can buy flowering oregano, great, add a few shakes of that)., Add the zest and juice from the remaining lemon, a good splash of red wine vinegar and a good lug of oil, and season to taste., Pick and finely slice the remaining mint leaves, saving any baby ones for later, and fold through the Greek salad., Scrunch up a large piece of greaseproof paper, then flatten it out again and oil it lightly on one side. Use it to line a 1.5-litre glass bowl., Spoon one-third of the quinoa into the bowl, top with half the Greek salad, another third of quinoa, the remaining Greek salad, and the rest of the quinoa. Press it all down with a spoon between each layer so it’s nice and compacted., Cover with another piece of greaseproof paper then place a small plate on top and sit something heavy on it. Refrigerate or leave somewhere cool to set for about 2 hours., When you’re ready to serve, carefully turn the salad out onto a board or plate, remove the paper, drizzle with oil and sprinkle over the reserved mint leaves. Serve with toasted pitta bread, sliced into fingers, if you like."

Carefully cut the pastry block in half with a table knife. Wrap the other half and refrigerate or freeze for later., Dust some flour onto a clean work surface and, using a rolling pin, roll out the pastry into a square, measuring 26cm x 26cm. Cut into 4 equal squares., Place the pastry squares on a baking tray, leaving a space between each., Using the back of a spoon, spread the centre of each square with pesto, but don’t spread it onto the edges., Squash the tomatoes into a large mixing bowl, then snap the asparagus spears into 3cm pieces. Keep the lovely pointy tips and a little of the stalk, but discard the end 3cm., Using a speed peeler, carefully shred the courgettes into ribbons. Tear the roasted peppers into strips and add to the bowl., Pick the basil leaves, reserving the pretty ones for later. Place the large ones in the mixing bowl., Mix the vegetables together in the bowl, adding a splash of oil. Pile a little of the mixture on each pesto-smeared tart and top with two olives (if using)., Break up the mozzarella and place little bits on top of each tart – this will make it gooey like a pizza.

Remove and reserve the seeds. Cut each half into quarters and lay the pieces in a roasting tray., Scrub, then quarter the larger beetroots and halve the smaller ones, then add to the tray. Peel and slice the onion into sixths and tuck in among the other veg., Remove the fronds from the fennel, popping them in cold water for later, then cut each bulb into 6 wedges and add to the tray. Drizzle with a little olive oil., In a pestle and mortar pound the coriander seeds with a good pinch each of sea salt and black pepper. Sprinkle this over all the vegetables on the tray and toss to coat., Roast the vegetables for about 40 minutes, shaking halfway through, until soft and golden and just starting to caramelise. Allow to cool slightly., Meanwhile, make your dressing by combining the vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, mustard and seasoning in a small jug or jam jar. Mix well., Dress the roasted veg while still warm so they soak up all the dressing, then pick and sprinkle over the herb leaves,  and reserved fennel tops., Cut the pomegranate in half and whack the back of each half with a wooden spoon to release the seeds, then add to the vegetables. Crumble over the feta, then gently toss everything together."

Halve the passion fruit and scrape in the pulp, then add the oil and mix together., Finely slice the cabbage, discarding the core. Remove the woody ends from the asparagus, then finely slice along with the trimmed spring onions and celery. Peel and coarsely grate the apple and carrot., Pop all the shredded fruit and veg into a large bowl. Pour over the dressing, mix well and season to taste., Enjoy straight away, or better still, cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 days so the veggies soften slightly and the flavours mingle and develop. Mix well before serving and spoon over a little extra passion-fruit pulp, top with shredded spring onions and sprinkle with poppy seeds."

In a separate bowl and cover the walnuts with water and place both bowls in the fridge to soak overnight., For the ‘spaghetti’, use a spiraliser to cut the courgettes into long curly strands or use a julienne peeler to slice into thin strips. Set aside., To make ‘parmesan’, blitz the cauliflower florets in a food processor until you have a grainy consistency. Place it on kitchen towel to soak up excess moisture while you prepare the rest of the dish., Place the garlic, rosemary and chilli in a food processor and blitz until finely chopped. Add the carrot, celery, red pepper and onion and 
blitz again until chunky., Drain and rinse the walnuts and add to the other ingredients in the processor with the beetroot, plum tomatoes, 150g of the cherry tomatoes, the lemon zest and juice, dates and sundried tomatoes (with their soaking liquid), parsley and half of the basil leaves. Quarter the remaining cherry tomatoes and set aside to garnish., Process the mixture until it forms a thick sauce and the walnut pieces resemble a minced texture. Depending how juicy your tomatoes are, you might need to thin it with a little extra water. Season to taste., To serve, divide the courgette ‘spaghetti’ between plates, pour over the sauce, sprinkle with the quartered tomatoes and cauliflower ‘parmesan’, then top with the remaining basil."

Finely slice the chives., Heat 1 tablespoon of peanut oil in a wok over a medium heat. Add the dried shrimps and shallots and stir-fry until the shallots start to soften., Stir in the minced pork and stir-fry for about 1 minute, or until the pork starts to brown. Season with a pinch of white pepper and a pinch of sea salt, then take it off the heat. Set aside to cool., In a large bowl, mix the three flours together with 400ml water until completely combined. Set aside., Pour 900ml of cold water into a large pan, grate in the stock cube and add the grated turnip, sugar, ¼ teaspoon of white pepper and ½ teaspoon of salt., Bring to the boil, stirring continuously to prevent the ingredients from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Remove from the heat and stir in the pork mix., Quickly stir the flour and water mix into the turnip pan, as it will start to thicken immediately., Once combined, pour it into the foil containers and sit them in both layers of your steamer. Pop the lid on and set it over a medium–sized wok just less than half–filled with water, making sure that the base of the steamer doesn’t touch the water., Steam for 40 minutes over a high heat. Add more water to the wok during cooking if needed – just be careful the steam doesn’t burn you. You can test if the cakes are cooked by pressing the tops – if they feel firm and springy and your finger doesn’t sink in, then they’re cooked. If the cakes give slightly, leave them in the steamer for an extra 10 minutes or so. (You can also insert a skewer into the middle of the cakes and if it comes out clean then they’re cooked.), Allow the cakes to cool completely in the tins before gently tipping them out and slicing them into sections. Typically the cakes are served as 8cm squares, but for a party it’s also nice to slice them into smaller (4cm), bite-size cubes., Place a wok over a medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of peanut oil and stir-fry the cake cubes until all the sides are nicely brown and crispy. Transfer to a serving plate., In a small serving bowl, combine both chilli sauces. Serve the turnip cake cubes sprinkled with the finely chopped chives, with the chilli dipping sauce on the side."

Place in a baking tin, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and fill the tin to a depth of about 5cm with water., Cover the dish with tin foil, then bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, or until a knife slips easily into the flesh and the skins slide off. Remove the beets from the tin and leave to cool., Peel and chop the onions into wedges, peel and finely chop the garlic, then drain and rinse the capers. Pick and chop all the herbs., On a baking tray, toss the onion wedges in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and season well. Add these to the oven too, and roast for about 30 minutes, or until soft. Remove and set aside to cool., When the beetroot is cool enough to handle, rub off the skins, then cut into wedges (wear plastic gloves for this, or your hands will be pink for days). Set aside., Blanch the beetroot stalks and leaves in a pan of boiling salted water for about 2 minutes, then drain well., Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a pan over a high heat, add the beetroot stalks and garlic and fry for a few minutes, until the garlic is golden. Then turn down the heat to medium, pour in the wine and cook for 10 minutes. Add the beetroot leaves, season, and cook until wilted., To make the vinaigrette, whisk the vinegar into the mustard, then stir in the olive oil and season to taste.

Peel and add the garlic, then bring to a simmer., Let it cook for 10 minutes until the garlic cloves are soft, then pour everything into a liquidiser., Add the vinegar, oil and mustard and blend for a few minutes, then stop and have a taste. You want it to be quite acidic, but if it’s too acidic add a bit of oil for balance., Add good pinches of sea salt and black pepper, then pour it over the sliced veg., Use your hands to toss and dress everything and get everyone around the table., Heat the seeds in a dry pan for a few minutes until warm, then scatter them over the salad.

Peel and thinly shave the celeriac, and place into a bowl of ice-cold water with the juice from ½ a lemon – this will stop it from discolouring. Set aside., Peel and shave the beetroots into another bowl, then halve and add the radishes. Slice the cornichons into rounds, then add to the bowl with the  walnuts and dill fronds., Make a dressing by peeling and finely dicing the shallots, then add to a bowl with the cornichon vinegar, the juice from ½ a lemon and 3 to 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Season well and set aside., Slice each bread slice into 3 strips and finely grind the juniper berries., Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the bread and sprinkle each side with the juniper. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until you end up with golden, crispy toasts., Mix the sour cream with a couple of squeezes of juice from the remaining lemon half and add a pinch of sea salt., Drain the fennel and celeriac and dry well with a kitchen towel, then gently toss with the beetroot and a couple of tablespoons of the shallot dressing. Pile in the middle of a large serving plate., Using a large spoon, bash the back of each pomegranate half so all the delicious seeds fall over the top of the salad., Serve with the hot toasts, the soured cream and a small pile of extra juniper on the side."

Lightly grease a 20cm x 30cm baking dish with oil., Get the kids to help you cover the baking dish with a layer of pastry, letting the edges overhang slightly. Brush with a little oil, then add another layer of pastry, repeating until you have used it all (there should be 3 or 4 layers)., Boil the kettle, then place the spinach in a colander and pour over the hot water to wilt it (you may have to do this in 2 batches). Push the spinach down with the back of a spoon, then, when it’s cool enough to handle, have the kids squeeze out any excess water, using their hands. Place the spinach on a board and roughly chop, then place in a large bowl and set aside., Put the grill on high and grill the bacon till crisp, then set aside to cool., Whisk the eggs in a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Whisk in the milk and mustard powder, snip in the chives, then grate in the lemon zest., Have the kids crumble the cooled bacon into the spinach and then trim, slice and add the leeks.

Season generously., Add the potatoes, tomatoes (breaking them up with a spoon, if using tinned), bay leaves and tomato purée to the pan and stir well. Add enough water to just cover the mixture and then simmer, covered, over a low heat for 20 to 30 minutes., Remove the lid, add the olives and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the potatoes are tender., Serve hot or at room temperature with a slab of feta and a sprinkling of oregano and a drizzle of oil, or as a side to grilled poultry."

Add a big lug of oil, and the fenugreek and mustard seeds., Fry until the mustard seeds start to pop, then stir in the mango chutney. Remove from the heat and leave to cool., Puff up the poppadoms by microwaving for a minute or two., Peel and grate the carrots on a large board, then chop and add the cucumber, spring onions, radishes, lettuce, tomatoes and chilli (deseed it first), mixing and chopping as you go.

mash with a fork., Peel and thinly slice the onion, and pick and finely chop the parsley, then add to the chickpeas. Squeeze over the lemon juice, then add the remaining ingredients and mix together. Season, and set aside., Warm the honey, then combine with the harissa in a small bowl and set aside., Next, prepare the vegetables. Trim and slice the aubergines lengthways, and thinly slice the courgettes. Deseed and slice the peppers, peel and slice the onions, then slice the tomatoes., Cook all the vegetables on a barbecue or char-grill pan over a medium heat, basting with the oil and turning occasionally, for about 10 minutes or until tender and cooked. Season while cooking., During the last 5 minutes of cooking time, baste the aubergines with the harissa and honey marinade. Leave them to cook for 3 minutes longer than the other vegetables, or until they begin to blacken and soften., Using a sharp knife, split open the flatbreads and lightly toast., To serve, place the vegetables and chickpea salad on the toasted flatbread with some salad leaves."

the onion., Heat a splash of oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then slowly cook the whole garlic and sliced onion for 30 minutes, or until sweet and sticky – keep the lid on the pan for the first 20 minutes to keep in all the moisture, then remove for the final 10 minutes so they get a little colour., Add 2 litres of water to the pan. When it comes to the boil, turn the heat down to low and simmer for 20 minutes., Preheat the oven to 120ºC/gas ¼., Remove any tough stalky bits from the kale leaves, then place a third of the leaves in a low-sided baking tray (this will ensure it crisps up)., Toss it with a little drizzle of oil, then spread the leaves out so they’re not overlapping. Roast for 30 minutes, or until crisp and still green., Strain the broth through a sieve and, using a large metal spoon, squash the onion and garlic to release the flavour back into the pan., In a small bowl, mix both miso pastes and the tahini with a little of the broth to loosen it all up. Stir this back into the main pan and season with soy sauce and mirin., Keep the broth warm until everything else is ready., Blanch the remaining kale in your broth for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with tongs and set half to one side – it is perfect as it is. The other half is going to become the pickle., When the kale for pickling is cool enough to handle, squeeze out all the juice into the broth, and put the kale in a bowl., Scrunch roughly with the sugar, vinegar and a pinch of sea salt, then finely slice and toss through the red chilli., Thickly slice and dry-fry the mushrooms in a frying pan for about 10 minutes, or until they look a bit wrinkly and have stopped releasing water., Pour in the teriyaki and a splash of oil and keep them all moving around the pan for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they have soaked it all up and they are dark and shiny., Cook the noodles in the broth, according to the packet instructions. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan., Once everything is ready, divide the noodles and broth between four bowls, along with the mushrooms, pickled kale, blanched kale and crispy kale for the top., Sprinkle over the toasted seeds, then serve with chilli sauce and toasted sesame oil for drizzling over."

If you’ve got any salady bits and bobs hanging around, serve them up alongside your burger. ”",578,11.8g,2g,17.3g,1.5g,17.8g,106.9g,13.4g,"800                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                sweet potatoes, 2                                                                                                                                                                teaspoons                                                                                                                                                                smoked paprika, olive oil, 1 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                chickpeas, 1 x 340                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                sweetcorn, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh coriander                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), ½                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                ground coriander, ½                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                ground cumin, 3                                                                                                                                                                heaped tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                plain flour                                                                                                                                                                , plus extra for dusting, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 1                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                round lettuce, 2                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                ripe tomatoes, tomato ketchup, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    wholemeal burger buns, extra virgin olive oil","Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Scrub the sweet potatoes clean, then halve and cut into wedges. Sprinkle over a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and 1½ teaspoons of paprika (save the rest for the burgers). Drizzle with ½ tablespoon of olive oil, toss to coat and spread in one layer onto two baking trays., Bake in the hot oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through., While your wedges are cooking, drain the chickpeas and sweetcorn and place in a food processor. Pick the coriander leaves, then add half to the processor along with all of the stalks. If you don’t have a food processor, place in a bowl and mash with a potato masher or fork., Add the spices, flour and a pinch of sea salt, grate in the lemon zest, then pulse until combined, but not smooth – you want to retain a bit of texture. If you don’t have a food processor, combine with a fork, then scrunch with clean hands., On a flour-dusted surface, divide and shape the mixture into four equally sized patties (roughly 2cm thick). Pop onto a tray and place in the fridge for around 30 minutes to firm up., Heat a splash of olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the patties and cook for around 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway., Click off 4 nice lettuce leaves, then finely slice the tomatoes horizontally., Halve the burger buns, then squeeze a large dollop of ketchup onto the base of each one (toast them if you like), then top with the burgers., Layer over a couple of slices of tomato, a lettuce leaf, a few coriander leaves and finally the burger tops., Chop the remaining lettuce with any leftover tomato, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, add a squeeze of lemon juice, season, toss to coat and serve up with the burgers and sweet potato wedges."

Cover with cold water, bring it to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. Drain again, and set the ham aside., To make the chilli oil, place the groundnut oil in a pan over a very low heat. Peel the garlic and finely slice along with the chillies, then add to the pan and warm through for 5 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn’t brown. Set aside to steep while making the soup (the oil can be strained before using, or left as is)., For the soup, peel and roughly chop the onion and ginger (keep them separate), then scrub and roughly chop the parsnips., Heat a glug of olive oil in a large pan and add the onion. Cook gently, stirring often, for 5 minutes, then add the parsnips, rogan josh paste and ginger, and cook for a further 5 minutes., Add the lentils, stock (if using) or the same amount of hot water and the ham hock and bring to the boil. Simmer for about 30 minutes, until the lentils are nice and soft., Remove and discard the ham bone and liquidise the soup until smooth. Return any lean ham to the saucepan and reheat., Finely shred the mint leaves and serve scattered on top of the soup with a dollop of yoghurt and a swirl of the chilli oil."

Parboil the chips in boiling salted water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until soft but keeping their shape., Drain in a colander and leave to steam until completely dry – this is very important before frying., Heat a deep-fryer to 180°C or fill a deep saucepan to three-quarters full with vegetable oil over a high heat. For safety, clear the kitchen and never leave hot oil unattended. To test when the oil has reached the required temperature, drop in a cube of bread – at 180°C it will turn golden in 10 seconds., Carefully fry the chips, in batches, until golden crisp. Drain on kitchen towel, then sprinkle with sea salt., If you’re feeling funky, peel and thinly slice the garlic and pick and finely chop the parsley, then carefully mix with the hot chips., Or if you're in a posh mood, drizzle them lightly with truffle oil (combine with olive oil if it’s very strong) and finely grate over the Parmesan. Serve nice and hot."

egg","Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Peel and finely slice the garlic, pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves, discarding the stalks. Peel and slice the onions, and slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways, roughly 5mm thick., Peel and cut the squash into 5mm slices, then place on an oven tray, season and drizzle over 3 tablespoons of oil. Roast on the top shelf of the oven for 35 minutes, or until soft, adding the garlic and rosemary after 20 minutes., Put the whole peppers on a second tray and place on the lower shelf of the oven for 35 minutes, or until blackened. Tip them into a bowl, cover with clingfilm and set aside for 10 minutes., Peel and discard the skins of the peppers, deseed, then slice the flesh into large pieces. Season, then place in a colander to drain., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan over a medium heat and sweat the onions for 10 to 12 minutes, or until just caramelised. Stir in the balsamic and sugar and cook for another 5 minutes., Place a griddle pan over a medium-high heat. Brush the aubergine and courgette slices with oil and place on the hot griddle for 5 minutes, until soft and lightly charred (do this in batches). Turn and season them halfway through, then transfer to a plate. Set aside., Fill and boil the kettle. Put the spinach in a colander and pour over the boiling water to wilt it. Let it cool, then squeeze it dry, chop it up and pop it into a bowl., Add the ricotta to the spinach, then finely grate in the lemon zest and half the Parmesan. Season, stir to combine and set aside., Reduce the oven temperature to 180ºC/350°F/gas 4 and grease and flour a 23cm spring-form cake tin., On a floured surface, roll out 420g of the pastry, so it fits the base and sides of the tin. Carefully press the pastry into the tin, leaving a little overhang, and trim off any excess., Pick the basil leaves. Sprinkle half the basil and half of the remaining Parmesan over the pastry base, then layer up the veg. Begin with the courgettes and aubergines followed by a layer of the peppers, then the spinach. Spoon over the squash and onions, dot over pieces of the goat’s cheese, then scatter on the rest of the basil and Parmesan., Beat and brush the egg around the edge of the pie. Roll out the rest of the pastry, place it on top and crimp the edges with your fingers to seal. Poke a hole in the pastry top and brush with the beaten egg., Bake the pie in the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden, covering the top with kitchen foil for the last 10 minutes if it looks too dark., Leave the pie to cool in the tin on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then take it out of the tin to cool completely. Serve hot or cold."

Lightly crush and add the coriander seeds, and drizzle over the vinegar and oil. Toss the carrots and garlic to coat, then season with sea salt and black pepper., Roast in the oven for 45 minutes, or until the carrots are tender and caramelised in places but still have some bite. Remove the garlic as it caramelises or if it looks like it’s burning., Squeeze the garlic flesh from the skins and mash well. Mix through the yoghurt then serve in a bowl next to the roasted carrots."

Parboil for 4 minutes, then drain., Transfer the carrots to a roasting tin and drizzle with the maple syrup or honey and avocado oil., Roast in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Shake the tin to make sure the juices coat the carrots, then let cool slightly (they're better served when they're still warm)., Rinse the sprouting seeds, finely chop most of the parsley leaves, then mix with the hazelnuts and slightly cooled carrots in a serving bowl., For the dressing, combine most of the orange zest with the orange juice, avocado oil, maple syrup or honey and 2 teaspoons of cracked black pepper., Pour over the salad and toss to coat. Chop and sprinkle over the remaining parsley and top with the orange zest for extra prettiness."

Gently roll little balls of the feta mixture into tiny sausage shapes and stuff these into the olives., Set up a little station by lining up three shallow bowls – the first with the flour, whisk the eggs in the second, and the last with the breadcrumbs., Pour the vegetable oil into a deep pan and place over a medium heat. Pop a cube of bread in the oil, and when it's golden it is ready to use., Working quickly, roll the olives in the flour, followed by the egg, letting any excess drip off, then finally coat in the breadcrumbs., Carefully lower into the hot oil and deep fry until golden and crisp., To make your sauce, place the leftover passata in a small pan with the oregano leaves and dried chilli., Season, place over a medium heat and simmer rapidly for 4 to 5 minutes, or until reduced slightly., Stir in a little extra virgin olive oil and serve with the fried olives and a glass of wine."

Slice the bacon, peel and finely chop the onions and garlic, then chop the carrots, celery and fennel. Pick the basil leaves, finely chopping the stalks., Heat a lug of oil in a pan over a medium-low heat, stir in the chopped ingredients and sauté gently for 15 to 20 minutes, or until everything is soft but not coloured., Halve and slice the courgettes lengthways. Core the cabbage or remove the tough stalky bits from the chard, then wash the leaves and finely slice., Add the wine to the softened veggies and bring to the boil. Tip in the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, then add the courgettes. Bring back to the boil, and simmer on a low heat for around 15 minutes., Mix in the cabbage or chard, the beans and their juice and the stock. Bring to the boil, then add the pasta. Simmer over a medium heat until the pasta is cooked (use the packet instructions as a guide) – if the soup is too thick, add a little stock or water to loosen., Season to taste, then rip in most of the basil leaves and dress with a few lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Stir well, and serve with the reserved basil and a fine grating of Parmesan."

Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4. Wash the potatoes and dry well, then prick each one with a fork and wrap in foil., Put on a rack in the middle of the oven and cook for about 1 hour 15 minutes. The exact time depends on the size of your potatoes, but to check, give them a quick squeeze, bearing in mind they’ll be hot: the potato should just give under your fingers., Remove from the oven then, when cool enough to handle, cut them into quarters. Leave to cool completely., Peel and dice the onion. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat and cook the onion for 10 minutes, or until soft., Cut the potatoes, skin and all, into 2cm chunks. Add the potato and Parmesan rind to the pan, season, then cook for 5 minutes., Add 1.25 litres of stock, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes., Remove the rind, then purée the soup until smooth with a stick blender or in a liquidiser. Return to the pan, check the seasoning, and thin with the remaining stock, if you like., Serve garnished with a dollop of sour cream, snipped chives and a pinch of black pepper.

If it breaks, don’t worry, it will all melt back together. Basically what you’re trying to create is a big halloumi plate. 
Once golden on both sides, slide it onto a serving board., Finely slice the beef tomato and lay the slices on top of the halloumi., Tip over the dressed tomatoes over and scatter with the reserved basil leaves., Take to the table with the tomato and roast garlic dressing to drizzle over before serving."

Pick over a few large mint leaves and throw on a good pinch of salt and pepper., Chop, chop, chop until you have finely chopped greens. Scrape these straight into your lunchbox, pour the uncooked couscous on top and gently sit a lemon half in it., Toast the seeds in a dry frying pan, then mix with the cumin and wrap in clingfilm, so they stay crisp until you’re ready to eat., In a small jar, add the juice from the remaining lemon half, a good swig of olive oil (twice as much oil as juice is a good ratio), the harissa and a few small mint leaves, then crumble in the feta. Mix well, screw the lid on and put in your lunchbox., At lunchtime, boil the kettle. Take the lemon, seeds and jar from your lunchbox, then pour in boiling water to just cover the couscous., Pop the lid on and wait 8 to 10 minutes until the water is absorbed and the spinach is wilted. Squeeze in the lemon juice, pour over the dressing and mix with a fork. Sprinkle with seeds before eating."

Turn up the heat and bring to the boil., Season, reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or until thickened and creamy. If it reduces too much, add a splash more water., Next, crack the eggs directly into the soup and reduce the heat slightly. Leave the eggs to poach in the soup for 5 minutes, or until the whites are cooked but the yolk is still a bit runny., While they’re poaching, make a salsa. Finely chop the coriander leaves and add to a bowl with the remaining chopped onion, the red wine vinegar and a few tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Mix well., When you’re ready to serve the soup, warm your tortillas directly over an open flame or on a hot griddle pan., Serve them alongside the black bean soup and salsa, and finish each bowl with a drizzle of the chilli coriander oil."

Peel the garlic cloves., In a large pan on a medium heat, fry the aubergine slices in generous amounts of olive oil, about 5 to 6 minutes on each side, or until golden brown – you will need to do this in batches, adding more oil as necessary, as aubergines absorb a lot., Transfer to folded paper towels to drain, and allow to cool before chilling until needed., For the dressing, pick and finely chop the mint leaves.

Add a good pinch of sea salt and a pinch of black pepper, the clementine juice (you can use oranges instead, if you prefer), vinegar and butter., Bring to the boil and cook for 20 minutes, or until nearly all the liquid has evaporated., Once the butter starts to glaze the carrots, add the thyme sprigs and reduce the heat to low.

Start by angling the tray and using a spoon to skim away about three-quarters of the excess fat (you can keep this for another day)., Place the tray on a medium heat on the hob and stir in the flour with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the sticky bits from the base and sides of the tray., Once combined, pour in the stock, or you can even use cooking water you’ve saved from your veggies. Bring to the boil, then leave to simmer gently for about 30 minutes, or as long as it needs to get to the consistency you desire. As it simmers, if any fat or foam rises to the surface, simply skim it away., If you want to add extra flavour, a swig of red wine, Vin Santo, sherry or port will work a treat. I also like to add a spoonful of jam or jelly for a touch of sweetness., When you’ve reached the consistency you want, pour the gravy through a coarse sieve into a saucepan, pushing all that goodness through with the back of a ladle, then keep warm over a low heat until you’re ready to serve."

It’s named after the conical-lidded pot that the stew is traditionally cooked in – the design allows steam to condense back into the dish as it cooks, to retain its juices. This vegetarian tagine doesn’t need meat for flavour – the vegetables absorb the essences of the coriander, cumin, saffron, ginger and tomato-y stock. The vegetables should be chunky so they hold their shape during the slow cooking.

   soft bread rolls","Preheat the oven to its lowest setting., Place the mash in a large bowl, then slice the spring onions., Set a medium saucepan on a medium heat. Add a little splash of oil, followed by the spring onion. Cook for about 10 minutes or until just starting to soften., Spread the breadcrumbs out on a baking tray. Bake in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes to dry out, then set aside. Raise the oven temperature to 200ºC/gas 6., Tip the spring onion into a food processor with the corn, peas and leftover veg. Pick the parsley leaves and put to one side, then place the stalks in the processor., Pulse to just combine, then use a rubber spatula to scrape the mixture into the bowl with the potato., Mix together, then season with a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper and a scraping of lemon zest. Alternatively, mash everything together with a potato masher in the large bowl., Line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper. Split the veg mixture into 12. Roll each into a ball and shape into fingers., Place each finger on the tray, then chill in the fridge for 10 minutes or so to firm up., Now it’s time to set up a little production line: tip the flour into a shallow bowl and mix in the paprika. Crack the eggs into another bowl and whisk well with a fork. Tip the breadcrumbs into the final bowl., Take the fingers from the fridge. One at a time, coat them in flour, dip in the egg, letting any excess drip off, and then roll in breadcrumbs., Place back on the tray, drizzle with oil and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden and cooked through., In the meantime, prepare your sandwiches. Discard the outer leaves from the lettuce, then break off the nice, smaller ones. Rinse, pat dry with kitchen paper and set aside., In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise and yoghurt together with a little squeeze of lemon juice.

Pick the dill., Bring a pan of water to a simmer over a medium-high heat. Add the aubergines, pop on the lid, reduce the heat and simmer for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they are tender. Take them out and drain well on kitchen paper., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., When the aubergines are cool enough to handle, scrape out the flesh with a spoon, being careful not to pierce the skin. Roughly chop the flesh and place it in a large bowl, and arrange the skins in a baking dish., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan over a low-medium heat, then add the garlic and onion and gently fry for 3 to 4 minutes, until soft. Stir in the cumin and cook for another minute., Add the garlicky onion to the bowl of aubergine along with the cooked rice, lentils, raisins and half of the dill, mix well and season to taste., Stuff the aubergine skins with the rice mixture, and place them back in the baking dish. Drizzle over oil and roast for 25 minutes, until golden., To make the tomato sauce, place all of the ingredients in a pan over a low-medium heat and simmer gently for 4 to 5 minutes, until thickened. Blitz with a hand blender until smooth., Spoon the sauce over the stuffed aubergines and serve with the feta crumbled over and the remaining dill scattered on top."

pith, and pick the thyme leaves. Place the feta into the first jar, layering it up with strips of lemon zest, thyme leaves, a little sea salt and a good pinch of black pepper. Top up oil to cover, then seal the jar., For the olives, use a pestle to split and slightly crush the coriander seeds in a mortar. Add to the second jar and squeeze in the lemon juice. Add the olives, chilli and bay leaves. Season with a little sea salt and a good pinch of black pepper. Top up with oil to cover, then seal the jar., Char the peppers over a direct flame on the hob until blackened. Pop in a bowl and cover with clingfilm for 5 minutes. Add the unpeeled garlic to the third jar with the rosemary, a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and the vinegar., When the peppers are cool enough to handle, peel off the skin, deseed and slice into 4cm-wide strips. Add to the jar and gently mix. Top up with oil to cover, then seal the jar., All will keep for up to 2 months unopened; once open, refrigerate and use within 2 weeks."

Slice about two-thirds of the way into the flesh., Pick the rosemary, then stuff the cuts in the potatoes sporadically with the rosemary leaves., Cube, then dot the butter over the base of a large roasting tray and drizzle in the oil. Pop the tray into the oven for a few minutes so that the butter melts, then place the potatoes carefully into the tray.

Roast for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden and cooked through, basting with the butter in the tray a few times during cooking and turning regularly until they are golden and crisp all over., Drizzle all the spuds lightly with the honey, then return to the oven or another 5 minutes., Remove from the oven and place the potatoes on a board or platter. Crumble over the gorgonzola and serve while still warm."

the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Finely chop the spring onions, then peel and finely slice the garlic. Chop the chillies., Heat a good glug of oil in a large, ovenproof pan. Add the spring onions, garlic and bay leaves, and cook over a low heat for 10 minutes, until the spring onions are soft and sweet., Bash the cardamom pods and the coriander and cumin seeds with a pestle and mortar and add to the pan with the turmeric, chopped chilli and a couple of hearty pinches of sea salt. Stir for 3 to 4 minutes over a medium heat, until the spices are fragrant., Increase the heat, add the rice and a little more oil if needed and stir to coat in the spices. Pour over about 800ml of cold water – you want it to come about 1cm above the rice. Pop the lid on and put the pan into the oven for 25 minutes., While the rice is cooking, put the root veg on a baking tray, drizzle with oil, season and pop into the oven to warm up for the last 10 minutes., Meanwhile, poach your eggs. Put a shallow pan of water over a medium heat, add a splash of vinegar and, once simmering, break in the eggs and cook for 2 to 3 minutes., Once the veg and rice are done, remove them from the oven and stir them together. Mix through the greens, herbs and lime juice., Pile the mixture into bowls, top each one with a poached egg, and serve with the pomegranate seeds scattered on top."

200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Using a pestle and mortar, grind the fennel and coriander seeds, and chilli flakes until fine., Place the cauliflower on a sheet of tin foil, rub in half of the ground spices and 1 tablespoon of oil, and season with sea salt and black pepper., Wrap the cauliflower in the foil, pop it on a roasting tray and bake for 30 minutes, or until tender, removing the foil for the last 15 minutes to give it a gnarly crust. Remove and set aside., Peel and finely grate the ginger and 6 cloves of garlic. In a bowl, combine two-thirds of the ginger, the grated garlic and the remaining half of the spice mixture., Make an incision in each aubergine with a small sharp knife, then rub the ginger mixture into each one, along with a drizzle of oil., Place the aubergines in a small roasting tray and cook in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until softened and starting to split. Set aside., Make your spice blend. Split the cardamom pods, add the seeds to a mortar with all the other ingredients, then grind well., Peel and finely chop the onions, then deseed and roughly chop the chillies and tomatoes, keeping them separate. Peel and finely slice the remaining 3 cloves of garlic., Place a large pan over a medium heat and toast the ground spices for 1 minute, or until aromatic., Stir in 1 tablespoon of oil, followed by the onions, green chillies, sliced garlic, and the remaining ginger. Cook for 10 minutes, or until the onion and garlic are softened and coloured., Add the tomatoes, cinnamon stick and 200ml of water and let it simmer over a low heat for 30 minutes., In a blender, blitz the cashews with 4 tablespoons of water until you have a smooth paste, then stir this into your curry. Cook for 5 minutes, or until thick and fragrant., For the tempeh, peel and finely slice the garlic, then add to a frying pan over a medium heat with a splash of oil, the curry leaves and mustard seeds., Fry for 1 minute, or until crisp, then drain on kitchen paper., Chop the roasted cauliflower into florets and stir into the curry along with the aubergines., Top the curry with the tempeh and shaved coconut. Halve the pomegranate and bash it, cut side down, with a wooden spoon so the seeds come tumbling out. Scatter the seeds over the curry, then serve with chapatis on the side."

make the shallot compote, peel and finely slice the shallots, and finely chop the dates., Heat the oil in a medium pan over a medium-low heat.

Season well and reduce the heat to low., Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the shallots have caramelised and the mixture has thickened. Remove from the heat and let it cool., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/gas 6., Trim and halve the parsnips, then peel and halve the shallots. Core and finely chop the apple., Heat the goose fat and butter in a 22cm-wide ovenproof frying pan over a medium-low heat. Add the parsnips and shallots, cut-side down, and cook for 10 minutes, until they begin to caramelise., Add the chestnuts and thyme sprigs, season well and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and top with about half of the shallot compote., Roll out the pastry and trim it so it’s slightly bigger than your pan. Remove the pan from the heat and roll the pastry over the top, tucking it in the edges. Bake for about 30 minutes, until the pastry is golden and crisp on top., Meanwhile, simmer the apple with 100ml of water in a small pan over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until softened. Season and stir in the balsamic., Serve the tarte tatin hot with the apple balsamic sauce on the side."

Pick the thyme leaves and tear the stale bread into small chunks., Lightly toast the nuts in a dry frying pan, then roughly chop. Pick and roughly chop the parsley., Cover the porcini with 300ml of boiling water and leave aside to rehydrate., Heat the oil in a large, wide pan and add the shallot and garlic. Cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 8 minutes or until the shallot is softened but not coloured., Drain the soaked porcini over a bowl, reserving the liquid. Add these and the rest of the mushrooms to the pan along with the bay and thyme leaves and cook until all the mushrooms are well softened. If they release a lot of liquid, pour it onto the diced bread and carry on cooking., When the mushrooms are tender and browned, tip the mixture into a large bowl and leave to cool completely., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Once the cooked mushroom mixture has cooled, add the chunks of bread, a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, the pecans or hazelnuts and about half of the porcini’s reserved soaking liquid (make sure you pour it through a sieve first to stop any grit getting through). Combine well., If the stuffing seems too dry, just add a little more of the reserved porcini liquid., Add most of the parsley and stir it through then tip the stuffing into a lightly greased baking dish of approximately 20cm x 25cm and cover with foil., Place in the oven and bake for 35 minutes, then remove the foil and cook for a further 10 minutes.

Using a small cutter or wine glass, about 6cm across, cut out 12 rounds (you may need to re-roll the pastry)., Place the circles on the baking tray and prick their centres several times with a fork. Beat the egg, then eggwash the circles. Bake on the top shelf of the oven for about 12 minutes until puffed up, crisp and golden. 

Roughly chop or tear the mushrooms, peel and finely slice the garlic, and crumble the chilli (if using). Pick and roughly chop the parsley., Heat a lug of oil in a large pan and cook the mushrooms, garlic and chilli (if using), until golden., Off the heat, squeeze in the lemon juice, then add the crème fraîche. Season well and fold through the parsley. If the mushrooms are too dry, add a splash of water to loosen the sauce., For the vol-au-vents, cut a very thin layer off the top of each circle and use your knife to carefully hollow out a hole in each one., Fill with the creamy mushrooms and serve – you can pop the pastry lids back on, if you wish."

Remove to piece of kitchen paper to drain, reserving the oil., Lay the cooked squash on a board, remove the stalks and, using a knife and tongs, carefully slice the squash lengthways, down the middle. Scoop out and discard the seeds., Finely chop the chilli and crumble the chestnuts, then sprinkle over the squash halves with the cinnamon and a good pinch of black pepper. Really mash and chop all the lovely toppings into the squash with your knife, so all the flavours go right through., Serve the squash halves topped with the crisp sage, the toasted pine nuts, a drizzle of the reserved sage oil and a little balsamic vinegar (if using)."

Add enough cold water to cover it all, pop the lid on, and bring to the boil over a high heat – about 30 minutes., Once boiling, reduce to a simmer over a medium heat with the lid askew and cook for 1 hour, or until the chicken is cooked through., Carefully lift the chicken out with tongs and put aside (use in the Leftover chicken with tomatoes & chorizo recipe). Pour the soup through a fine sieve, discarding what’s left behind. To further clarify it, strain through 4 layers of muslin. Have a taste to check the flavour balance, and season with sea salt and black pepper, if needed., Skim off fat if serving straightaway. If you’re leaving it for another time, chill, then scoop off any fat that sets on the surface. Gently reheat the soup before serving. If you think it needs a bit of a colour boost, scoop out a cup of the broth and add 1 tablespoon of tomato purée to it. Mix until well combined then return to the broth and mix again., Delicious served simply with a drizzle of basil oil, a few herb tips and a shaving of Parmesan, if you like."

Add the red wine vinegar and thyme to one pan and the white wine vinegar and bay to the other., Keeping the colours separate, peel and slice the onions using a food processor, or you can slice them finely with a knife., Place both pans over a high heat and bring to the boil. Place the red onions in the pan with red wine vinegar and the white onions in the other pan., Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, pushing the onions down with the back of a wooden spoon to stop them rising to the surface., As soon as the onions have softened, use a slotted spoon to transfer them into sterilised jars. Ladle over the vinegar, then close the lids and leave to cool. These can be eaten straight away, but if you leave them for at least 2 weeks they’ll taste even more amazing."

Kimchi | Vegetable recipes | Jamie magazine,A Korean favourite,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/6EYwjcReqvD9Lajgy0GMA7.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['1', 'litre']",5 minutes,"“Kimchi is Korea’s famous dish and is traditionally made with cabbage, spiced up with garlic, ginger and shrimp paste. It’s full of flavour, but what’s more, it’s good for you too. The cabbage is mixed with salt, which starts off the lacto-fermentation process, where naturally occurring bacteria convert the vegetable sugars into lactic acid, a natural preservative. And, as beneficial bacteria thrive, eating it aids digestion. It’s so easy to make your own, and you can adjust the ingredients to suit your own tastes. Kimchi will last for up to three months in the fridge in an airtight jar.  ”",22,0.5g,0.1g,2.6g,1.4g,2g,3.2g,1.5g,"1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Chinese cabbage, 6                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 1                                                                                                                                                                thumb-sized piece of                                                                                                                                                                ginger, 2                                                                                                                                                                teaspoons                                                                                                                                                                caster sugar, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                Korean shrimp paste, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                dried gochugaru                                                                                                                                                                 , (see tip), 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                daikon                                                                                                                                                                , (see tip), 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                    spring onions","Quarter and remove the stalks from the cabbage, then chop it into 4cm pieces and place in a large bowl.

Wearing disposable gloves, use your hands to mix it all together thoroughly., Spoon the kimchi into a large kilner jar and press it down so the juices rise, leaving a gap at the top, then close and seal the lid., Leave the kimchi to ferment at room temperature for 2 to 5 days (place the jar on a plate to catch any brine that might bubble over.) Check the kimchi every day, letting out some gas and pressing the vegetables down into the brine., When the kimchi tastes delicious, transfer the jar to the fridge for up to 3 months."

Put the cider vinegar, shallot, bay leaves, spices and 150ml water in a stainless-steel saucepan along with a few good pinches of sea salt. Bring to the boil then simmer for 5 minutes or so to give the aromatics time to flavour the liquid., Peel and cut the celery into 5cm chunks. Drop the celery into the pickling liquid and simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes, or until the celery is heated through but still with a good bit of crunch; this really depends on how thick the stalks are. While the celery is poaching in the pickle, crush the olives gently with your thumb to flatten them down to the stone. Don’t remove the stones, but drop the squashed olives in with the celery for the last minute of cooking., Pour the pan’s contents through a sieve set over a bowl (discard the pickling liquid or use once again) and leave to drain and cool. Refrigerate until you want to serve, then tip into a bowl and toss with a splash of olive oil, sea salt and a little pepper."

Simmer for 30 minutes until cooked, then drain and leave to cool. You should be able to slip off the skins once they're cool enough to handle. Halve or quarter any big ones, leave smaller ones whole., In a separate pan, add the vinegars and sugar.

Stir in the coriander seeds, fry for a couple more minutes, then add the lentils., Stir in 800ml boiling water and bring back to the boil. Season well, reduce the heat, pop on the lid and simmer for 40 minutes, until the lentils are cooked and beginning to break down., Blacken the peppers by either placing them directly on a gas flame, or griddling them in a griddle pan, turning regularly until blackened all over. Pop them in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and let stand., After about 5 minutes the peppers should be ready, so flake away the blistered skin and remove the stalk and seeds. Slice the flesh into thin strips and leave to one side., Place the chipotle chilli in a small bowl and pour in just enough boiling water to cover. After a few minutes, it should have softened; carefully remove from the bowl and finely chop., Place a medium-sized pan over a medium heat and pour in a lug of olive oil. Add the garlic and all the chillies and fry for 1 minute, then add the peppers and paprika. Fry for a few more minutes, then add the tomatoes., Season well and gradually bring everything to a simmer. Leave to bubble away gently for 10 minutes, until you have a thick and rich tomato sauce. Add a splash of red wine vinegar and set aside. Chop the coriander leaves, then stir through., When your lentils are cooked, roughly purée with a stick blender, then pop back over a medium heat with a lug of oil. Fry for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, so you end up with crispy fried lentils., Place a frying pan over a medium heat and add a splash of oil. Crack in the eggs, one at a time, and cook to your liking. Slice the avocados and dress with the juice of 1 lime.

In a large roasting tray, toss and massage it with 1 teaspoon of oil, the ground coriander and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Deseed the peppers and cut into 3cm chunks, then, in a separate tray, toss and massage them with 1 teaspoon of oil and the smoked paprika. Place both trays in the oven for 35 minutes, or until softened., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop ¼ of an onion and put aside, then roughly chop the rest and place in a large casserole pan on a low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Crush in the garlic, add the bay leaves and a good splash of water and cook for 20 minutes, or until soft, stirring regularly., Tip in the beans, juice and all, then half-fill each empty tin with water, swirl and pour into the pan. Simmer until the time is up on the squash and peppers, then stir both into the pan., Trim, finely slice and add the okra, and simmer for a further 20 minutes, or until the feijoada is dark and delicious, loosening with an extra splash of water, if needed., Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the packet instructions, then drain., To make a quick salsa, deseed the tomatoes, then finely chop with as much chilli as you like and most of the coriander leaves. Scrape into a bowl with the reserved finely chopped onion and toss with the lime juice, then season to perfection., Remove 4 portions of feijoada, bag them up and once completely cool, freeze for a rainy day, when you’ll be really grateful it’s there., Serve the remaining feijoada with the rice and salsa, a spoonful of yoghurt and a sprinkling of the remaining coriander leaves."

Mix until nicely combined., Evenly divide the muffin mixture between the cases. Sprinkle over the sunflower and poppy seeds, then dot over the reserved slices of chilli., Use the remaining Parmesan to give a light dusting of cheese over each one, then bake at the bottom of the oven for 45 to 50 minutes (if using squash, it’ll be a bit quicker – check after 35 minutes), or until golden and set., These are amazing served warm 5 minutes after taking them out of the oven, and good kept in the fridge for a couple of days. Enjoy 2 muffins per portion."

tablespoons should come out – it’s messy, but really important to do this for great burger texture later)., Place the tofu in a bowl, scraping it off the tea towel. Crack in the egg, then add the breadcrumbs and Marmite. Mix and scrunch together really well with clean hands, then shape into 4 even-sized patties that’ll fit nicely in your buns once cooked., Roughly chop the tomatoes and put into a dry non-stick frying pan on a high heat with a pinch of black pepper, a splash of water and the vinegar., Squash the tomatoes with a potato masher, cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until thick and delicious, then tear in the basil leaves and season to perfection (I sometimes add a pinch of dried red chilli flakes too, for a kick)., If you want to plump up your buns, pop them into a warm oven for a few minutes., Meanwhile, finely slice or prep all the salad veg., Next, pick the basil leaves into a blender and blitz with all the other dressing ingredients and a pinch of salt and pepper until super-smooth., Place 2 teaspoons of oil in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Pick the rosemary leaves into the pan in four piles, place the patties on top and cook for 3 minutes on each side, or until golden., Slice or grate the cheese, place on the patties, reduce the heat to low, then cover and leave to melt for 3 to 4 minutes., Spread the tomato sauce into the buns, then sandwich the cheesy burgers and sliced gherkins inside., Toss the salad with half the dressing (save the rest for another day), serve alongside the burgers and enjoy – totally awesome."

Place a griddle pan over a high heat to get smoking hot., Halve and deseed the peppers, then add to the griddle with the corn. Grill for 8 to 10 minutes, or until charred and bar-marked, turning occasionally. Remove to a plate to cool., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. Drain and add the black beans, stir in the cumin and fry for 4 to 5 minutes, or until crisp, stirring occasionally., Once cooled, cut the corn kernels away from the cob and chop the peppers into 1.5cm chunks. Reserving 1 tablespoon of the corn, add to a large bowl with the peppers and black beans., Trim, finely slice and add the spring onions, reserving a small handful to one side. Deseed, finely slice and add the chilli. Pick and add most of the coriander leaves, reserving the stalks., Squeeze in the lime juice and season well with sea salt and black pepper., Wipe the frying pan clean with kitchen paper, then return to a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil., Peel and finely slice the garlic and finely slice the coriander stalks, then add to the pan for 1 minute., Stir in the tomatoes and ½ a tin’s worth of hot water, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a wooden spoon. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened and reduced., Season to taste, carefully transfer to a liquidiser and blitz until smooth., Divide the vegetable mixture between 8 corn tortillas and roll them up.

Drain and pat dry with kitchen paper to get rid of any excess moisture, then season with a good pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper., Heat 1cm of groundnut oil in a large wok over a medium heat. Drop a small piece of tofu into the hot oil – if it sizzles and turns golden, it’s ready to go. Add the tofu in batches and fry for 5 to 8 minutes, or until golden, turning regularly., Meanwhile, toast the cashew nuts in a dry frying pan for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden. Tip into a pestle and mortar and crush lightly. Peel the garlic and deseed the chillies, then finely slice. Slice the pak choy lengthways into quarters, then halve each piece lengthways again. Trim and slice the spring onions into 2cm pieces., Once golden, use a slotted spoon to remove the tofu to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain. Carefully remove and discard most of the oil, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pan, then return to a medium-high heat. Add the garlic and chilli and fry for 1 minute, or until lightly golden, then add the pak choy and spring onions. Fry for a further 3 to 4 minutes, or until softened slightly. Stir in the mirin, soy sauce, honey, sesame oil and vinegar for 1 minute and give it another good stir. Throw in the cashews and fried tofu, toss well for a minute to warm through, then serve straightaway."

board, slice the crusts off the ciabatta, then cut into 2cm chunks and place into a large mixing bowl., Cut the pepper in half, scoop out all of the seeds and white pith with a teaspoon, then cut into 2.5cm chunks and add to the bowl., Cut the halloumi into 2.5cm chunks and add to the bowl., Holding the courgette flat on a chopping board, use a Y-shaped peeler to peel off long thin ribbons of courgette, then place into the bowl., Cut the mushrooms in half or into quarters, depending on the size, then add to the bowl., Peel the onions and cut into thin wedges and place in the bowl., Carefully slice the chilli in half lengthways (if using)., Hold the stalk end of each half steady, then run a teaspoon down the cut sides to scoop out the seeds and white pith., Finely chop and sprinkle into the bowl, then wash your hands thoroughly., Using a microplane, finely grate the lemon onto a board, then scatter into the bowl., Drizzle over 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil., Pick the rosemary leaves, discarding the stalks, then finely chop and sprinkle into the bowl., Add the cherry tomatoes to the bowl., Using your hands, toss and mix everything together – you can leave to marinade in the fridge at this stage for added flavour., Remove the skewers from the tray, discard the water and wipe the tray dry., Divide and thread the ingredients between your skewers – pick whichever ingredients you want, just don’t push them too close together otherwise they won’t cook properly., Place each one onto the tray., Put the griddle pan on a high heat to warm up (or you could cook them under the grill or on the barbecue)., Place the skewers onto the griddle pan and cook for around 8 minutes or until cooked through, turning every 2 minutes to get nice and golden on all sides – you may need to do this in batches., Once cooked, transfer the kebabs to a serving platter and serve with a fresh zingy salad and some rice or flatbreads."

Trim, wash and finely slice the leek. Peel and dice the carrot, onion and celery., Heat a splash of oil in a medium pan on a medium heat, add the leek, carrot, onion and celery. Pop the lid on and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until softened. Add the lentils, stock and peas, then bring to the boil, stirring regularly. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through., For baby, remove a small amount to a blender (use a hand-held stick blender, if you prefer), or a bowl, then either blend to a purée, pulse, mash and/or finely chop depending on the stage your little one is at (for more information on stages of complementary feeding, click here)., For adults, season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, then add the tomato purée.

carrots, and trim the leek and celery, then blitz in a food processor until finely chopped (if you want your sauce a little chunkier, coarsely grate them instead, using a box grater)., Heat the oil in your largest heavy-based pan over a medium heat, then add the onion mixture and fry for 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Finely chop the remaining vegetables (again, coarsely grate, or roughly chop by hand for a chunkier sauce), then add to the pan and fry over a low heat for a further 20 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Stir in the oregano, tomato purée and bay leaf, fry for 2 to 3 minutes, then pour in the chopped tomatoes or passata., Add the sugar and vegetable stock (I try to use homemade stock, but if you’ve only got stock cubes, that’s fine too), then cover and let it bubble away over a low heat for 30 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally – the longer you cook it, the more the flavour will develop as it reduces and thickens., When it’s ready, fish out the bay leaf and season to how you like it (it’s important to season the sauce right at the end – it will thicken and intensify in flavour as it cooks, so you might find it’s salty enough already)., Divide the sauce between freezer-proof containers and leave to cool, then label and pop into the freezer for up to 3 months, to use whenever you like. This is great as a simple pasta sauce or in my lasagne, with simple spaghetti & meatballs or as a tasty base for pizza."

running water and drain again – this will stop them from cooking further., Tip the noodles into a large mixing bowl, pulling them apart with your fingers, then put aside., Squeeze the juice from 1 lime into a small mixing bowl and stir in the plum sauce, honey and a dash of soy sauce., Trim and finely slice the spring onions, then peel and finely chop the garlic and ginger. Slice the sugar snap peas in half lengthways, then deseed and slice the peppers into 1cm strips and shred the Chinese cabbage., Put a large wok on a high heat and when screaming hot, add the vegetable oil, garlic and ginger. Fry for a few seconds, then add all the prepped veg and stir-fry everything together for 1 minute, before adding the noodles, beansprouts and frozen peas., Stir all the ingredients together, making sure nothing’s stuck to the bottom, then cover with a lid and cook for a couple of minutes., When the noodles and veg are hot through, push the mix to one side of the pan and pour in the sauce. When it starts bubbling, mix through the noodles, loosening with a splash of water, if needed., Remove from the heat, then taste and add a little more soy, if necessary. Drizzle lightly with sesame oil (if using), then serve up right away with the remaining lime cut into wedges for squeezing over."

Anyone can make them – just make sure you use a good, sharp chef’s knife and your biggest chopping board – and watch your fingers!, It’s best to start chopping the harder, crunchier veg first – trim the ends off the spring onions and cucumber on a large chopping board, then roughly chop them., Pick and roughly chop the basil leaves, discarding the stalks, and bring to the middle of the board along with the spring onions and cucumber and continue chopping and mixing everything together as you go., Carefully cut all the way around each avocado lengthways, going as deep as the stones., Hold each avocado in your hands and twist until you can pull the two halves apart., Pull out and discard the stones from the centres – you can use a teaspoon to help you scoop it out, then scoop the flesh onto the board., Use scissors to snip over the cress, then continue chopping everything together, bringing the ingredients back into the middle every now and then., Once everything is chopped, you’ll have a big mound of salad on the board – make a well in the middle and add the extra virgin olive oil., Cut the lemon in half., Squeeze over the juice, using your fingers to catch any pips., Add a tiny pinch of salt and pepper, and toss together so everything is nicely coated, then serve."

Roast for around 1 hour, or until all the veg is soft, then tip into a large jug., Add a good splash of boiling water, then blitz with a stick blender to your desired consistency. At this stage, remove a portion for your baby, if needed (you can freeze in ice-cube trays for another day)., Place the remaining blitzed veg into a pan add the stock, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Add the pastina or break in the spaghetti/linguine, then stir through the soup, adding a splash more water to loosen if the soup is quite thick because the pasta will absorb the water., Place on the hob for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked through., Serve with good grating of Parmesan cheese (not for your baby, and only a little for toddlers)."

Peel and very finely slice the garlic, then pick and finely chop the rosemary. Finely slice the bacon., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large pan on a medium heat, then add the rosemary and bacon. Fry for a few minutes, or until the bacon is just turning golden, then add the chopped celery, carrots, leeks and garlic. Cook gently for around 15 minutes, or until soft, stirring regularly., Add the beans (there’s no need to drain them) and stock. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes – add a little more stock or water if you think it needs it., Finally, add the spinach or kale and the peas and cook for a further 3 minutes, or until the greens are cooked but still a vibrant green. Have a taste and season with sea salt and black pepper, if needed, then tuck in."

Pour the mixture into the well and mix thoroughly, gradually bringing in the flour from the sides until you get a rough dough – if it’s too sticky, add a little more flour., Knead in the bowl until smooth., On a flour-dusted surface, split the dough in half. Divide one half into two (for the adults) and the remaining half into 4 (for the kids)., Roll each piece into a ball and place on a semolina-dusted tray, leaving a gap between each one. Cover with clingfilm and place in a warm place to prove for 35 minutes, or until doubled in size., Next, make the sauce. Peel and finely chop the onion, then clean and roughly chop the mushrooms. Trim and roughly chop the celery and carrot, peel and finely chop the garlic, and pick the oregano., Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a medium pan on a medium heat, then add the onion, celery, carrot and garlic., Cook down for a few minutes, then add the remaining veg, oregano, chopped tomatoes and a good splash of water., Season lightly with black pepper, then cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft. Blitz until smooth with a stick blender, adding a splash of water to loosen, if needed., On a flour-dusted surface, press and shape a piece of dough out to the thickness of a pound coin, keeping the crust on the thicker side – this will help hold the sauce., Drizzle with a little oil, then spoon on a nice layer of sauce, spreading it all over the pizza, stopping 1cm from the edge., Tear and dot over mozzarella, then top with whatever you fancy – I like finely sliced courgette and red pepper, with some fresh oregano and a small grating of Parmesan, to finish, but feel free to come up with your own combinations., Pull the pizza onto a flat semolina-dusted tray, then very carefully slide onto the preheated tray that's in the oven. Cook for 7 to 10 minutes for the kids' pizzas and around 15 minutes for the larger ones, or until golden, crispy and cooked through., Repeat with the remaining dough and keep cooking them as and when you’re ready. Serve with a crisp green salad."

Tip back into the pan and top up with cold salted water., Bring to the boil over a high heat, pop the lid on, then reduce to a low heat for around 20 minutes, or until cooked through but still with a bit of bite, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, peel the onion and 1 clove of garlic and trim the celery and carrot, then roughly chop and place into a processor. Blitz until finely chopped., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat, add the blitzed veg and fry for 12 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Once cooked, drain the bulgur wheat and leave to cool., Pick the parsley leaves and put to one side, then roughly chop the stalks. Place the stalks and most of the leaves into the processor. Drain and add the chickpeas, then crack in the egg. Add the breadcrumbs and half the cooled bulgur, then blitz to a rough paste., Tip into a large bowl with the cooked vegetables and the remaining bulgur., Finely grate in the lemon zest and Parmesan, then add it to the bowl. Season with a pinch of black pepper and mix well with your hands until smooth., Divide and roll the mixture into golf-ball-sized balls, placing them on a tray as you go – you should end up with 24 in total. Cover the tray with clingfilm and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Peel and finely chop the remaining garlic. Return the large ovenproof frying pan to a medium heat, drizzle in 1 tablespoon of oil, then add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes, or until golden., Tip the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, then pour in ½ 
a tin’s worth of water. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for around 5 minutes, or until thickened. Squeeze in half the lemon juice., Once the veggie balls are firm, remove from the fridge. 
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, add the balls and cook for around 8 minutes, or until browned all over, turning occasionally, then transfer to the tomato sauce., Tear the red peppers into strips with your fingers, then arrange in the sauce. Season the sauce to taste and dot over the ricotta., Place the pan in the oven for around 20 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. Serve with a scattering of parsley leaves and lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Season lightly, then toss well so the potatoes absorb all those lovely flavours. Season to taste, then leave to cool completely., Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Crush the olives with the flat side of your knife, tear out and discard the stones, then roughly chop the flesh. Add the olives and capers to the pan and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until crisp. Meanwhile, pick and roughly chop the coriander leaves, then trim and finely slice the spring onions. Stir them through the salad, sprinkle over the olives and capers, then serve."

Place into a roasting tray with the chilli flakes, ground coriander and cinnamon, a drizzle of olive oil and a little sea salt and black pepper, then toss well., Spread out into an even layer and place in the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden and crisp., Meanwhile, cook the quinoa in boiling salted water according to the packet instructions., Slice the broccoli into small florets, then halve and finely slice the stalk. Place into a heatproof colander and rest it over the quinoa pan. Cover and steam for 3 minutes, or until just tender., Once cooked, drain and rinse the quinoa under cold running water, then leave to cool along with the broccoli. Remove the sweet potato from the oven and leave it to cool, too., Meanwhile, toast the nuts in a dry frying pan over a medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a pestle and mortar and crush lightly., Halve the pomegranate and squeeze half the juice into a large bowl. Add 3 times as much extra virgin olive oil, the lime juice and balsamic vinegar. Whisk well and season to taste., Add the cooled broccoli and sprouts to the dressing, then snip in the cress. Roughly chop the coriander (stalks and all), finely slice the chilli and add to the bowl along with the quinoa and sweet potato., Toss well, spread out on a serving platter, then scoop out and dot over the avocado flesh., Bash the reserved pomegranate half with a wooden spoon so the seeds come tumbling out and scatter these over the platter along with the nuts, snip the cress on top, then serve with the feta crumbled over the top."

Gradually add 125ml of cold water, continuously mixing until it comes together to form a rough dough, adding a splash more water, if needed. Bring it together with your hands, wrap in clingfilm and place in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Snap off and discard the woody ends from the asparagus, then slice the stalks into 1cm chunks, reserving the tips. Blanch the asparagus (including the tips), peas and broad beans in a pan of boiling salted water for 1 minute, then drain. Roughly chop and stir in the spinach so it wilts slightly, then refresh the veg under cold running water. Drain well and place into a large bowl. Trim, finely slice and add the spring onions., Finely slice the bacon (if using), then add to a frying pan over a medium-high heat and fry for 5 minutes, or until golden, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk in the cream, milk and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Chop and stir in the chives., On a flour-dusted surface, roll out the rested dough to roughly ½cm thick. Roll the pastry up around the rolling pin, then carefully unroll it to cover a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Gently press the pastry into the tart tin, moulding it to the tin as you go (don’t worry if it breaks – patch up any holes with spare pastry)., Trim away any overhanging pastry, then line with a double layer of clingfilm. Fill nearly to the top with uncooked rice or beans, then bake in the oven for 12 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove the rice or beans and clingfilm, then return the tart case to the oven for a further 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp., Spoon the greens into the pastry case, put the bacon pieces on top, pour in the cream mixture and crumble over the goat’s cheese. Place the quiche in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until just set. Leave to cool slightly, then serve with a crisp green salad."

Preheat your oven again to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Drizzle the polpette with oil and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the balls are golden and crisp., While they are cooking, make a tomato sauce. Place a medium-sized, non-stick pan over a medium heat and pour in a glug of oil. Finely slice the remaining garlic clove, finely chop the parsley stalks (reserving the leaves for later) and add both to the pan. Fry for 1 minute before scrunching in the tinned tomatoes., Fill the tin halfway with water and add, along with a splash of balsamic, then gently bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook over a low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, until thickened., Pour the sauce into a food processor and blitz until smooth, then return to the pan and keep warm until needed., Divide the sauce between plates, arrange the polpette on top, chop and sprinkle over the reserved parsley leaves and fennel fronds, and serve."

Top and tail the onions. Bring a saucepan of water to the boil over a medium heat, add the onions and simmer for about 25 minutes, until tender and easily pierced by the point of a knife., Drain the onions and allow to cool slightly. Cut them in half and, using a teaspoon, scoop out and reserve the flesh, leaving three layers intact to form your shells., Carefully slice the reserved onion flesh as finely as possible. Heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the sliced onion and fry for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Turn up the heat and cook for another 25 minutes, until the onion is deeply golden and crisp. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and season well., Preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4. Wipe the onion pan clean with kitchen towel and add the crushed cumin and coriander seeds. Toast over a medium heat for a couple of minutes, or until fragrant., Add the remaining olive oil along with the rice, lentils, turmeric, allspice, cinnamon and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Stir to coat the rice with oil, then add the stock, bring up to the boil, cover tightly and simmer over a very low heat for 25–30 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove the lid, cover with a tea towel, pop the lid back on and set aside for 10 minutes., Stir through the fried onions, toasted almonds and most of the chopped parsley. Season and spoon the mixture into the soft onion shells, filling them generously, then sandwich two sides together and place in an oiled baking dish, spooning any extra filling around the edges., Sprinkle over the red wine vinegar and sugar, cover the dish tightly with tinfoil and bake in the oven for 25 minutes, removing the foil for the last 5 minutes. Scatter with the remaining flaked almonds. Serve the stuffed onions warm, with a rocket salad on the side."

combine the flour, baking powder, a good pinch of sea salt and the ajwain seeds (if using) in a large bowl., Use your fingers to rub in 120ml of oil until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in 150ml of cold water, then bring it together with your hands into a rough dough, adding a splash more water, if needed., Place in a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 30 minutes., Peel and chop the potatoes into rough 2.5cm chunks, then break the cauliflower into florets so they’re roughly the same size., Add the potatoes to a large pan of boiling salted water and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until tender, adding the cauliflower after 3 minutes. Add the peas for the final minute, then drain., Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then peel and finely grate the ginger. Deseed and finely chop the chilli., Drizzle a lug of oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, add the cumin and onion and cook for 8 minutes, or until softened but not coloured. Stir in the garlic, ginger and chilli, then fry for a further few minutes., Bash the fennel seeds to a fine powder and add to the pan along with the garam masala and ground coriander. Stir well., Stir the cooked veg into the pan and crush gently with a potato masher – don't overdo it: you want a fairly chunky mixture. Squeeze in the lemon juice and season to taste. Leave to cool, then pick, finely chop and stir in the coriander leaves., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Lightly grease a large baking tray with oil., On a flour-dusted surface, halve the dough and roll out each portion to about 3cm thick. Using a 7cm pastry cutter, stamp out as many circles as you can, then roll into rounds, roughly ½cm thick and 18cm in diameter., Cut each round in half, then brush the straight edges with a little water. Roll into a cone shape, bringing the straight edges together and pressing lightly to seal., Spoon in the filling, brush the exposed dough with a little water, then fold over and press to seal. Place onto the prepared baking tray, then repeat with the remaining ingredients, keeping the samosas covered with a damp tea towel as you go., Brush the samosas with a little oil and bake for 45 minutes, or until golden and piping hot through.

Gently bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Gradually add 4 tablespoons of lemon juice, stirring continuously so the curds and whey separate., Carefully pour the mixture into the sieve so the curds collect in the muslin. Place under cold running water to get rid of any whey, then gather up the muslin and squeeze out the excess moisture., Keeping the muslin bundle in the sieve, cover it with a plate and top with a few heavy weights (a couple of tins work well). Place in the fridge for 1 hour 30 minutes to set. Once set, cut the paneer into 2cm chunks., Drizzle a lug of oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, add the paneer and fry for 5 minutes, or until golden, stirring frequently. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain., Peel and finely chop the onion, garlic and ginger., Return the pan to a medium-low heat, adding a splash more oil, if needed. Add the cumin seeds, fry for 1 minute, then add the onion and cook for around 8 minutes, or until softened., Stir in the garlic, ginger, garam masala and turmeric. Halve, deseed and very finely chop the tomato, add to the pan and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally., Stir in the frozen spinach, cover and cook for 5 minutes, then stir in the cream, paneer and a splash of boiling water., Reduce the heat to low and cook for a further 5 minutes with the lid off, or until reduced to a deliciously creamy consistency. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper and serve immediately."

Meanwhile, place the noodles in a large bowl, cover with boiling water and leave for 1 minute. Drain, rinse under cold water, then set aside., For the filling, finely slice the cabbage and peel and julienne the carrot. Add these to a large bowl with the noodles., Slice the white part of the spring onions on the diagonal and add to the bowl. Finely slice the green parts into ribbons and reserve for later., Peel and grate the ginger, then finely chop the chilli. Roughly chop the herbs and add to the bowl with the ginger and chilli., Crush the peanuts and add to the bowl with the sesame oil, beansprouts, soy and oyster sauces, and mix well., When they’re ready, drain the mushrooms, then chop them and stir into the filling. Season to taste., In a small bowl, blend the cornflour and 2 tablespoons of cold water., Next, lay one spring-roll wrapper, smooth-side down, on a clean surface as a diamond shape, with one corner pointing down towards you. Sprinkle a little of the five spice powder over it, then place another wrapper on top (the extra thickness will stop the rolls from breaking open while cooking)., Spoon 2 tablespoons of the filling on the bottom corner of the double wrapper. Brush each corner with the cornflour mixture, then start rolling up from the bottom. When the filling is covered, pull the corners in from each side (to seal the ends as you go). Continue rolling until the filling is tightly covered, then press to seal the top corner., Lay the finished roll on a large baking tray and cover with a damp tea towel. Continue until you’ve filled all the wrappers., Heat the groundnut oil in a large wok or saucepan over a medium heat. To check whether the oil is ready, drop in a piece of potato; it should sizzle and start to turn golden. In small batches, carefully lower the spring rolls into the oil and deep-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper., Serve with the sweet chilli sauce and reserved sliced spring-onion tops."

Heat a lug of oil in a large wok or heavy-based saucepan over a medium-high heat, add the mushrooms and fry for 4 minutes, or until lightly golden. Stir in the chilli paste and bamboo shoots and fry for a further minute., Meanwhile, mix together 3 tablespoons of soy, 4 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar, the honey and a good pinch of white pepper. Stir the mixture into the pan and cook for a minute, then pour in the hot stock and bring gently to the boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Meanwhile, chop the tofu into 1cm cubes, finely slice the spring onions and chives and whisk the egg well., Once reduced, remove the soup from the heat. Using a chopstick, stir the soup in a clockwise direction until you get a little whirlpool, then slowly add the beaten egg, stirring continuously to form thin ribbons. Stir in the tofu and return to the heat for 1 minute to warm through. Season to taste with soy and vinegar, then serve immediately with the spring onions and chives scattered on top."

Trim and finely slice the spring onions, reserving the green part for later., Heat a good lug of oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the mushrooms and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened., Add the chopped garlic, chilli, ginger, courgette, coriander stalks and the white part of the spring onions. Fry for a further 3 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden., Meanwhile, combine the cornflour and 2 tablespoons of water, then mix in the soy, agave syrup, sesame oil and rice wine or sherry. Stir the mixture into the pan and cook for a further 3 minutes, or until thickened., Roughly chop and add the spinach along with the noodles. Toss well to warm through, then tear in most of the coriander leaves., Serve with lime wedges, sambal or chilli sauce and the reserved coriander and spring onions scattered on top."

In a large bowl or measuring jug, dissolve the sugar in 50ml of boiling water., Remove and discard the tough outer layers of the lemongrass and finely chop. Stir through all the other ingredients and squeeze in the lime juice, then set aside., Peel and thinly slice the onion. Heat a little sesame oil in a frying pan and fry the onion over a low-medium heat, until soft and golden at the edges, about 10 minutes. Set aside., Drain the tofu and break into very rough chunks. In the same pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the sesame oil over a medium heat, then add the tofu and fry until it starts to go crispy on the edges – about 5 minutes., Stir in the hoisin sauce and keep it on the heat for about 3 minutes, until it’s sweet and sticky and coats all the tofu. Add the sesame seeds for the final minute, then it’s done., Soak the noodles in boiling water until soft, then drain., For the salad, grate the carrot and cucumber (or use a crinkle cutter). Finely slice the baby gem and spring onions. Pick the mint leaves. Combine all the salad ingredients in a bowl and set aside., Crush the peanuts, finely slice the chilli and cut the lime into wedges., To assemble your meal, divide the noodles between serving bowls, followed by the salad, then the tofu and onion, scatter over the peanuts and chilli and generously share out the dressing. Serve with extra toasted sesame oil, lime wedges and chilli sauce."

Add the coriander (stalks and all), flour, cumin and cayenne, season well with sea salt and black pepper, then blitz to a rough paste. Pulse in the sesame and sunflower seeds until combined., Divide the mixture and shape into 4 equal-sized patties, roughly 2cm thick. Place on a lightly flour-dusted tray, turning them in the flour to coat. Firm up in the freezer for 10 minutes, then transfer to the fridge., Preheat the oven to 160ºC/325ºF/gas 3, while you make the vegan mayo and onion rings., For the mayo, trim and roughly chop the spring onions and chilli (deseeded if you like) and place in a blender. Peel and add the garlic, along with the chickpeas, mustard, tomato paste, brandy, lemon juice and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Blitz well to combine, then, with the blender still running, slowly pour in 4 to 5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil until smooth and the same consistency as mayonnaise., For the onion rings, peel the onion and slice horizontally into 2cm-wide rounds. Separate into rings, then place in a bowl with the vinegar and a pinch of salt. Leave for 5 minutes., Meanwhile, combine the flour and baking powder in a bowl, then gently whisk in the ale until smooth, thick and coating the back of a spoon nicely., Place a medium, deep pan over a high heat, pour in the sunflower or sunseed oil and allow to heat up. To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a piece of bread into the pan – if it floats to the surface, sizzles and turns golden, it’s about right., Drain the onions, dust a handful of them with flour until lightly coated, then dip them into the batter. Remove with a slotted spoon and allow any excess batter to drip off, then carefully lower into the hot oil., Cook for around 1 minute, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway with the slotted spoon. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain, then repeat with the remaining onion., When you’re ready, cook the burgers in 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway and pressing down with a fish slice to get them nice and crispy., Transfer to a baking tray, then pop into the oven while you prepare the remaining ingredients., Finely shred the lettuce and mix with half the vegan mayo (keep the rest in the fridge for up to 2 days). Slice the tomatoes and place on a plate lined with kitchen paper., Sprinkle over a little salt and pick over the basil leaves. Top with another piece of kitchen paper and pat lightly to remove any excess water., Slice the gherkins lengthways, then halve and destone the avocado. Scoop out the flesh, cut into slices, then squeeze over the lime juice., Halve the burger buns and toast on a hot griddle pan or under the grill., Once ready, pile the dressed lettuce and sliced tomatoes and basil on to the burger bun bases. Pop the burgers on top, snip over the cress, then layer over the avocado, gherkins and crispy onion rings., Add a good squeeze of ketchup to the burger bun lids, place them on top, squeezing down gently, then tuck in."

the heat), then finely chop the ginger. Place into a small bowl, squeeze in the juice of both limes, then add the remaining sauce ingredients and 1 tablespoon of water. Mix well, then taste and adjust the flavours, if needed., Prepare the noodles according to the packet instructions. Drain, then leave to cool. Cut away any tough stalky bits from the kale, finely slice and place into a large bowl with the cooled noodles and beansprouts., Peel and slice the carrot into thin batons, roughly 5cm in length, then add to the bowl. Finely slice and add the ginger., Cut the pomegranate in half, hold one half over the bowl, cut-side down, and bash the back of it with a wooden spoon so that all of the seeds come tumbling out. Repeat with the other half. Pick in the herb leaves and add the sesame oil, then toss well., Dip one of the rice paper wrappers in a shallow bowl of warm water. Allow to soak for around 10 seconds until soft and pliable, drain on kitchen paper, then place onto a board., Spoon 1 heaped tablespoon of the filling onto the wrapper in a rough line, about 3cm from the edge nearest to you (be careful not to overfill them as they’ll be hard to roll)., Fold the edge nearest to you over the filling, then tightly roll it away from you, tucking in the left and right edges as you go, then press down to seal., Repeat with the remaining ingredients, halve each roll at an angle, then serve with the dipping sauce – enjoy!"

Always keep an eye on the fire and top up the heat source, if needed., Halve and destone the peaches, then lie them cut-side up in a snug-fitting roasting tray. Drizzle with oil, slide into the hot oven and roast for 20 minutes, or until charred and sticky. Keep an eye on them and rotate the tray for even cooking., Place two peach halves on each serving plate. Pop a small chunk of mozzarella and a slice of Parma ham over each one. Squeeze the lemon juice into a jam jar and add three times as much oil, season with salt and pepper and shake well. Place the rocket and mint leaves in a bowl, drizzle with the dressing, then scatter the leaves over the peaches. Serve straight away."

Meanwhile, finely chop the mushrooms., Peel and crush in the garlic, then add the chopped mushrooms. Cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms start to soften. Add the mustard and wine, season with salt and pepper, then reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until all the liquid has boiled and bubbled away. Set aside to cool., Add the cooled mushroom mixture and breadcrumbs to a large bowl. Pick, finely chop and add the parsley leaves, then pick in the thyme leaves. Stir well to combine, then season to taste., Cut the sheets of puff pastry in half lengthways so you have four equal-sized pieces. Spoon a quarter of the mushroom mixture along the middle of one length of pastry, moulding it into a long sausage shape with the back of a spoon., Brush the almond milk along the pastry edges, then carefully fold one of the long sides of the pastry up over the filling. Press the edges to seal, then crimp with a fork.

egg","To make the pastry, sieve the flour, salt and xanthan gum into a bowl.  Place the butter and 130ml water into a small pan over a low heat and bring to the boil, then set aside to cool slightly. Beat the eggs, then stir into the flour mixture. Gradually add the warm butter until it comes together into a rough dough, then bring it together with your hands. Cover and leave to rest while you make the filling., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper., Trim and finely chop the leek. Melt the butter in a medium pan over a low heat, then add the leek and thyme leaves. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until softened, then leave to cool. Pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, then add to a bowl with the leftover veggies, mustard and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mash well, stir in the cooled leeks and grate in the cheese., On a lightly floured surface, divide the pastry into 12 equal pieces, then roll each one out to roughly the thickness of a pound coin (if you find the pastry crumbles too much, roll it out between two large pieces of clingfilm). Using a saucer (roughly 12cm in diameter) as a guide, cut the pastry into circles., Place roughly a spoonful of the mixture on one half of each pastry round, spreading it out slightly. Beat the egg, then brush it around the edges. Gently fold the pastry over the filling, pressing the edges to seal. Place on the prepared baking tray, brush with a little more egg, then pop in the hot oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp, brushing with a little more egg halfway through. Serve hot!, TOP TIP If you’re short of time, you can buy ready-made gluten-free pastry in the freezer section of most supermarkets – just remember to fully defrost it before using."

free-range egg, semi-skimmed milk","Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Lightly grease a 25cm non-stick loose-bottomed tart tin with vegetable oil., Halve the pumpkin, scoop out and discard the seeds, then roughly chop into large wedges (there’s no need to peel it). Spread out on a baking tray, cover with tin foil, then pop in the oven for around 1 hour, or until tender, removing the foil for the final 10 minutes., Meanwhile, make the pastry. Sieve the flour and xanthan gum from a height into a large bowl, then stir in the sugar and cinnamon. Chop the butter into cubes, then use your fingertips to rub it into the flour mixture until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Beat the egg in a separate bowl, then add it to the mixture. Use your hands to bring it together into a rough dough, adding a good splash of milk (if needed), but don’t overwork it too much at this stage. Pat the dough into a flat round, roughly 2.5cm thick, wrap in clingfilm and place in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes., Once tender, remove the pumpkin from the oven and leave to cool. Roll out the pastry to roughly the thickness of a pound coin (if you find it crumbles too much, roll it out between two large pieces of clingfilm). Carefully place the dough into the prepared tart tin, gently pressing it into the sides. Trim away any overhanging pastry, prick the base with a fork, then place in the fridge to chill for another 10 minutes., Place a layer of clingfilm into the chilled tart case, fill with uncooked beans or rice, then pop in the oven to blind bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the clingfilm and beans or rice, then cook for a further 5 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely., Meanwhile, scoop the cooled pumpkin flesh into a food processor, discarding the skin, then blitz until smooth. Melt the butter in a small pan over a low heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until dark and frothy. Add the brown butter to the blitzed pumpkin with the sugar, flour, nutmeg, ½ teaspoon of cinnamon and the vanilla extract. Whisk 2 eggs in a separate bowl, add to the processor, then blitz again until well combined. Transfer the mixture to the cooled pastry case, using a fork or spoon to spread it out evenly., Roll out the leftover pastry to roughly the thickness of a pound coin, then cut it into long strips, roughly 1cm wide. Place on top of the pie, crisscrossing them as you go to create a nice lattice, then trim away any rough edges. Beat the remaining egg and brush over the pastry. Place the pie in the hot oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until golden. Dust with icing sugar and cinnamon, then serve."

flour and xanthan gum into a bowl, then add 1 teaspoon of sea salt., Place the butter and 150ml water into a small pan over a low heat and bring to the boil, then set aside to cool slightly., Beat the egg, then stir into the flour mixture with the warm butter until it comes together into a rough dough. Bring it together with your hands, then cover and leave to rest while you make the filling., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Peel and finely slice the onions, then add to a medium pan over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil, the rogan josh paste, cumin seeds and chilli flakes., Peel and crush in the garlic, then fry for around 10 minutes, or until golden and smelling delicious. Stir in the tomato purée and cook for a further minute, then add the spinach and stock. Cook for a further 5 minutes, or until thickened and reduced., Remove the pan from the heat. Mash the cooked veg, then stir it into the pan. Grate in the cheese, stir well, then season to taste. Spoon the mixture into a pie dish (roughly 20cm), spreading it out evenly., On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to roughly ½cm thick (if you find it crumbles too much, roll it out between two large pieces of clingfilm)., Beat the egg, then brush it around the edges of the pie dish. Carefully place the pastry on top, trim away any scruffy edges, then pinch the edges to seal., Score a cross in the middle, use any extra bits of pastry to decorate the top, then brush over more egg., Place the pie dish on a baking tray, then pop in the hot oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden and piping hot through, brushing over more egg halfway through cooking. Delicious served with gravy and steamed greens."

Gado-gado means medley or potpourri, which refers to all the different seasonal veggies and ingredients that are used, making it slightly different wherever you go and whatever the time of year. Tossed with the most incredible peanut dressing, which to be honest is more of a substantial sauce, and served with something crunchy on the side, such as prawn crackers, it’s a winning combination.

Scrub the potatoes and cook in boiling salted water for around 15 minutes, or until tender, then halve or slice up., Soft-boil the eggs for 6 minutes, or longer if you prefer them more cooked., Cut the tofu into 2½cm chunks and fry in a splash of sesame oil for around 15 minutes, or until golden, then sprinkle lightly with sea salt., Finely shred the cabbage if you want it raw or, if you’d rather cook it (which is traditional), cut it into 2cm slices, place in a colander and slowly pour a kettle of boiling water over the top. For me, this is the perfect amount of heat to soften the cabbage, but means you keep much of the delicious nutrients in there – feel free to apply this to any other seasonal greens you can find, too., Cut the tomatoes into wedges, quarter the radishes and slice the cucumber (I use my crinkle-cut knife – you should get one!). Season everything from a height with a little salt., Next, put all the sauce ingredients into a blender, peeling the garlic and grating in the palm sugar (if needed), then blitz until smooth. Have a taste and adjust the seasoning, making sure the acidity of the lime sings through, so tweak with more, if needed., Traditionally, you’d take a little bit of everything, put it into a bowl and pour the sauce over the top, which is a fine way to serve it. I like to do the reverse, because I feel that once you pour the sauce over you can’t see the care and attention that has gone into the preparation of the ingredients. So I spoon the sauce between four bowls, spread it up around the sides, then divide the ingredients around the bowls, taking a bit of pride in making them look nice., Pick over a few coriander leaves, add the prawn crackers and some finely sliced fresh chilli (if using), then show everyone what a celebration of food this is by getting them to toss together their very own portion."

The ability potatoes have to get mega crispy on the outside and super-fluffy in the middle when cooked is so good. Skinny and shoestring fries are delicious, but a proper fat handcut chip is something else. It’s just a shame that they’re not very good for you, but, like a good old cake, life wouldn’t be quite the same without them. At home, we don’t cook chips very often, so when we do have them, we definitely want the real deal. So let me tell you how I make the perfect chip – if you’re going to do it, do it right. ”",330,20.3g,2.4g,1.2g,0.5g,4g,34.8g,2.6g,"800                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Maris Piper potatoes, sunflower oil","Three obvious things are important on your journey to perfection – your choice of potato, your choice of oil and your choice of salt. For me, the Maris Piper potato wins every time, and you want to use nice large ones., On oil, sunflower and sunseed are very efficient, and many people swear by using groundnut oil. But, if you’re after flavour, cooking chips in beef tallow (rendered beef fat you can get from your butcher) gives you better flavour and colour – the choice is yours., Finally, on salt, being an Essex boy, in my house it has to be Maldon sea salt., So down to business: chop 800g of Maris Piper potatoes into finger-sized chips, leaving the skin on – don’t be too exact., Chip shops have massive industrial fryers, which you can’t recreate at home, so you need to use a large sturdy pan on a medium to high heat (unless you own a deep-fat fryer, of course). Your oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full. If you don’t have a thermometer, use a raw chip, and as it starts to float and fry the temperature should be about 140°C, which is perfect for blanching., Use a large metal sieve to gently lower the chips into the pan for around 8 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, then remove to a tray to cool., Turn the heat up under the oil and return one blanched chip to the oil as a guide again. Once it’s floating and golden the temperature should be about 180°C, which is perfect for frying and will give you chips with those all-important crispy outsides and fluffy middles., At this stage you may want to cook your chips in 2-portion batches, so you don’t decrease the temperature of the oil too much or overcrowd the pan. Fry the chips until beautifully golden, then remove to a bowl lined with kitchen paper, shake around a bit, season with sea salt and serve right away."

Peel and trim the parsnips, cutting them into batons approximately 5cm long and 1cm thick. Finely chop the shallot and crush the garlic for the dressing., Bring the stock to the boil, add the lentils and bay leaf and simmer gently for 25–30 minutes, or until the lentils are just tender but still retain some bite. Drain the lentils, discard the bay and set aside., Place the walnuts on a baking tray and toast in the oven until lightly browned and fragrant. Remove the tray from the oven, carefully scoop out the walnuts, and add the parsnips in their place. Drizzle with the olive oil and roast for 35 minutes until golden., Make the dressing by whisking together the walnut oil, vinegar, honey and mustard. Season and stir in the garlic and shallots., In a bowl, toss together the lentils, walnuts, parsnips and dressing. Place the watercress or rocket onto plates, pile on the lentil salad and shave over some vegetarian hard cheese."

Season well and mix together gently., Roast for 25 to 30 minutes, until the florets and sprouts are tender and starting to caramelise. You may find that the loose sprout leaves start to really crisp up; don’t be alarmed, it adds a lovely smoky element to the overall flavour., Transfer the roasted cauliflower and sprouts to a serving bowl and add the pine nuts and raisins.

Place in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and leave to simmer gently, partially covered, for 40 minutes. Drain and set aside., Finely grate the zest of one of the lemons into a bowl and squeeze in the juice from both, passing it through a fine sieve, to ensure no pith or pips remain., Finely chop the dill and onion, and add to the bowl with the sugar, olive oil, capers and 1 teaspoon of sea salt. Whisk all of the ingredients together until fully amalgamated., Run the beetroots under a cold tap and gently slide off the skins (they should peel off easily). Trim the tops and bottoms from the beetroots and discard. Then, using a mandolin or a sharp knife, slice the beetroot into very thin rounds., Arrange the beetroot slices on a serving platter or individual plates and spoon over the dressing, letting it sink into every crevice of the beetroots. Cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours before serving."

large baking tray to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Start by making the pastry. Sift the flour and xanthan gum into a food processor, add the margarine, vegetable shortening and a pinch of sea salt, and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. If you don’t have a food processor, place the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and cut together with the flat of a knife., Add 2 tablespoons of cold water, pulsing as you go (or stirring with a flat-bladed knife, if making the pastry by hand), until the mixture begins to pull together to form a dough., Tip the pastry into a large bowl (or keep in the same bowl, if making it by hand) and, using your fingertips, pull together into a ball. Knead lightly for about 2 minutes  or until smooth and elastic., Shape the pastry into a ball and place between 2 large sheets of clingfilm, then roll it out into a circle slightly larger than the tart tin and no thinner than 3mm. Peel off the uppermost sheet of clingfilm and carefully flip the pastry into a deep 23cm tart tin. Peel away the remaining clingfilm and gently press the pastry into the sides of the tin, filling in any cracks with pastry and patting it flat with your fingertips. Trim the edges and set aside., Next, prepare the potatoes. Peel and cut in half, quartering any large ones. Place in a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. The second the water begins to boil, time the potatoes, allowing them to cook for  4 minutes before removing from the heat and draining. Shake the potatoes in the colander a little to chuff up the edges – this helps them crisp up., Pour 8 tablespoons of the groundnut oil into a large roasting tin, tip in the potatoes and 1 heaped teaspoon of sea salt and firmly shake to coat evenly. Set aside while you make the filling for the tart., Finely chop the onion, crush the garlic, then finely grate the carrots. Trim the stalks from the chestnut mushrooms and slice into rounds. Halve 240g of the chestnuts (the rest will be used for the topping)., Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy-based frying pan until hot, add the onions and cook gently over a low heat until softened. Add the carrots, garlic, thyme and mushrooms, and fry gently until softened and all of the liquid from the mushrooms has been absorbed – around 10 minutes., Stir in the cream cheese and halved chestnuts and mix together gently until the cheese has softened and formed a creamy mixture. Season to taste, spoon the filling into the pastry case then level the top., Place the tart on the baking tray on the top shelf of the oven and the potatoes on the bottom shelf. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is crisp., Remove the tart from the oven, cover loosely in foil to retain its heat and set aside. Move the potatoes to the top shelf of the oven and increase the temperature to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Continue roasting the potatoes for a further 25 to 30 minutes until golden and crisp., For the gravy, heat the walnut oil and redcurrant jelly in a small saucepan, stirring until melted and smooth. Add the hot stock, bring to a simmer and stir in the cornflour. Simmer gently and stir continuously until you have the desired consistency. Set aside., Finally, tear the wild mushrooms into pieces, roughly chop the remaining chestnuts and finely chop the parsley. Heat the garlic oil in a heavy-based frying pan until hot, add the mushrooms and fry gently until softened. Stir in the chestnuts, cranberries and parsley, and spoon over the tart to form a decorative layer. Reheat the gravy and serve with the tart and roast potatoes."

Leave to cool completely in the baking tray, as it will be quite delicate straight from the oven. Keep the oven on., For the topping, chop the sweet potato into cubes, then place on a baking tray. Toss with a little oil, then bake for 25 minutes, or until soft., Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, slice and add the mushrooms along with 1 teaspoon of cracked black pepper, and sauté for 6 to 8 minutes, until the mushrooms brown., Blitz the roasted sweet potato in a food processor with the crème fraîche, nutmeg and ½ a tablespoon of cracked black pepper (or to taste) to a smooth, creamy consistency., To assemble the tart, crumble the blue cheese over the base, arrange the sautéed mushrooms on top, then finish with the sweet potato mix., Sprinkle with linseed, roughly chop and scatter over the pistachios followed by the sunflower seeds, then add a drizzle of rapeseed oil, and pop back in the oven for 6 to 7 minutes until it just starts to brown.

Pick the coriander leaves and set aside, then finely slice the stalks. Heat a splash of groundnut oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, then add the garlic, ginger and coriander stalks. Fry for around 3 minutes, or until golden. Slice the mushrooms, then add to the pan for around 5 minutes, or until lightly golden brown., Add the vinegar, chilli sauce and soy, then cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the liquid has boiled and bubbled away and the mushrooms are golden brown and starting to caramelise. Transfer to a bowl., Trim and finely slice the spring onions, then add the white part to the bowl. Deseed and finely slice the chilli, then add half to the bowl, reserving the rest for later. Stir in 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, then set aside., Add the coconut milk, 2 heaped tins’ worth of flour and a good pinch of sea salt to a food processor. Whiz to a dough, then transfer to a flour-dusted surface and roll into a thick sausage. Cut into 12 equal-sized pieces, roll into balls, then flatten into rounds, roughly ½cm thick., Equally divide the mushroom mixture between each of the 12 dough circles (you'll need roughly 1 tablespoon of filling per circle), making sure to leave a 2cm gap around the edges. Pull and fold the sides over the filling, pinching the edges together to seal. Place upside-down (so the scruffy edges are underneath) in double-layered, lightly greased muffin cases and divide between two bamboo steamer baskets., Place a wok over a high heat, then fill with 1 litre of boiling water and pop the steamer baskets on top. Reduce the heat to medium and steam for around 12 minutes, or until piping hot through and puffed up., Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Once the buns are ready, sprinkle over the seeds and the reserved spring onions and chilli. Tear the coriander leaves on top, then serve with hoisin sauce for dipping."

Pick the coriander leaves, adding half the leaves and all the stalks to the processor., Add the spices, flour and a pinch of sea salt, finely grate in the lemon zest, then pulse until combined, but not smooth – you want to retain a bit of texture., On a flour-dusted surface, divide and shape the mixture into 4 equal-sized patties, roughly 2cm thick. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up., Heat a splash of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the patties and cook for 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway., Meanwhile, click off, wash and spin-dry four nice lettuce leaves, then finely slice the tomatoes horizontally., Squeeze a large dollop of ketchup onto the base of each bun (toast them if you like), then top with the burgers. Layer over a couple of slices of tomato, a lettuce leaf, a few coriander leaves and finally the burger tops. Delicious served with a fresh green salad."

and bash to a coarse powder., Peel and finely chop the ginger and garlic, then add to the frying pan over a medium heat with a splash of oil. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden, then place into a food processor with the toasted spices., Coarsely grate the courgettes, place into a colander in the sink, then sprinkle with a good pinch of fine sea salt. Squeeze the mixture together with your hands to get rid of the excess moisture, then add to the processor., Pick the coriander leaves and set aside, then add half the coriander stalks to the processor with the drained chickpeas, breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and pepper. Pulse until combined, but not smooth – you want to retain a bit of texture., Transfer to a clean work surface then, with wet hands, divide and shape the mixture into eight little fat fingers. Place onto a tray, then pop in the fridge to chill for around 20 minutes., For the minty yoghurt dip, halve the cucumber lengthways, scoop out and discard the watery seeds, then roughly chop., Pick and finely slice the mint leaves, then place into a bowl with the cucumber, yoghurt and a squeeze of lemon juice. Mix well., For the nutty sauce, peel and finely slice the onion and garlic, then finely slice the remaining coriander stalks. Place into a large frying pan over a medium heat with a splash of oil, then cook for a few minutes, or until golden., Add the cashew nuts and toast for a further 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a food processor. Add the coconut milk and peanut butter, then blitz until thick and smooth., Return the large frying pan to a medium heat with a splash of oil. Once hot, add the kofte and cook for around 2 minutes, or until golden and piping hot through, turning regularly., Divide the kofte between your plates, tear over the coriander leaves, then serve with the nutty sauce and minty yoghurt dip and lemon wedges for squeezing. Delicious with pitta breads or fluffy rice."

Sieve in the flour and spices, then fold through. Peel and grate the apple (core and all) and carrots, then stir into the mixture along with the orange zest and juice and sultanas. Roughly chop and add the walnuts, if using., Pour the mixture into the prepared cake tin, then place on the middle shelf of the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden and an inserted skewer comes out clean. Leave the cake to cool in the tin for around 5 minutes, before turning it out onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely., Meanwhile, make the icing. Beat the butter, icing sugar and most of the orange zest until pale and smooth, then stir in the cream cheese until just combined., Once cooled, decorate the cake with the icing. Lightly crush the walnuts in a pestle and mortar and sprinkle on top. Finish with a grating of orange zest, then serve."

Place in a roasting dish, toss with 2 tablespoons of oil., Roast for 20 minutes, then add the unpeeled garlic cloves. Stir everything thoroughly and return to the oven for 20 minutes more, or until the vegetables are soft and browned., Remove and discard the papery skins from the garlic cloves. Put the roasted veg in a large pan with the vegetable stock and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 15 minutes, then liquidise with a stick blender, until completely smooth., To make  the flatbreads, toast the fennel seeds in a dry frying pan for 30 seconds or so, until fragrant. Crush roughly with a pestle and mortar, then pour into a bowl with the flour and ½ teaspoon of sea salt., Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 100ml of hand-hot (not boiling) water, then add it to the flour mixture with the oil and 60 to 75ml of hot water and mix until you have a soft, but not sticky, dough. Knead for 5 minutes., Pop the dough into an oiled bowl, cover with oiled clingfilm and set aside to rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Then, with oiled hands, divide the dough into 8 and roughly roll each one into a thin oval. Stack them up, separating them with baking paper to stop them from sticking together., Heat a griddle pan until it’s smoking hot and add the flatbreads (you’ll need to do this in batches). Cook for a couple of minutes on each side, until charred and puffed up. Keep warm in a tea towel while cooking the rest., Gently reheat the soup, and serve with a swirl of cream, a scattering of herby fennel tops (if you have them) and the hot flatbreads."

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then cover, reduce to a simmer and cook for about 1 hour, until they are soft. Drain and set aside to cool. As soon as they are cool enough to handle, peel off the skins and roughly cut into 3cm wedges., While the beets are cooking, toss the seeds in a little olive oil with the paprika and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then toast them in a dry frying pan until golden. Remove from the pan and set aside., Make the dressing by whisking the buttermilk in a jug with the juice of half the lemon and a good lug of olive oil. Season well. Chop the herbs and stir them into the dressing. Leave to one side., Melt the butter in the frying pan you toasted the seeds in, and finely grate in the zest of the orange. Add a squeeze of orange juice, the cinnamon and sugar and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and leave to bubble away for around 10 minutes until caramelised and sticky. Remove from the heat and toss through the cooked beets. Leave them to cool slightly in the pan, then spread out onto a platter., Toss the salad leaves with the buttermilk dressing and scatter over the beets. Finish with the toasted seeds."

chapati flour in a large bowl with ¾ teaspoon salt and about 200ml cold water, then knead for 10–12 minutes. Shape into a ball, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest., Heat most of the vegetable oil in a pan over a medium heat and sauté the onion, garlic and ginger, stirring, for 6–8 minutes, until softening. With a slotted spoon, remove the onion mixture to a bowl and set aside., Toast the mustard and cumin seeds in a dry pan over a medium heat for 30 seconds, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until fragrant. Transfer to a large saucepan with the rest of the vegetable oil, tomatoes, curry leaves and remaining spices. Cook for a further 5 minutes over a medium heat., Add the reserved onion mixture, potatoes and chillies and season generously with salt and pepper. Pour in about 600ml water, or enough to just cover the mixture. Bring to a simmer over a low heat, cover with a lid and continue to simmer for 8–10 minutes. Add the cauliflower and cook for another 8–10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the potatoes and cauliflower are tender., Meanwhile, cook the parathas. Place a flat, cast-iron, Indian-style tava over a medium-high heat. If you don’t have one of these, use a frying pan or flat griddle. Divide the dough into 6–8 balls.

the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. If I’m short of time, I’ll keep this simple and empty the beans straight into a sturdy 20cm x 30cm baking tray, so they make a flat layer across the bottom, but, to take it a step further, pimp them up first. Finely slice the onion, garlic, peppers and chilli (I leave the seeds in, but deseed if you prefer). Heat a splash of oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then add the chopped veg and thyme leaves and fry for around 8 minutes, or until softened. Dice the tomatoes and add to the pan for another 5 minutes or so, or until jammy and reduced. Pour in the beans and simmer for a final 5 minutes, then season to how you like it and pour into the baking tray in a flat layer., To make the cheesy mash, quarter the potatoes, halving any smaller ones, then put into a pan of boiling salted water. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain in a colander, then return the empty pan to a low heat, place the colander on top and allow the potatoes to steam dry for a couple of minutes. Tip out any excess liquid from the pan, then tip in the potatoes, add the butter and about 75ml of milk. Mash well until light, fluffy and smooth, adding a splash more milk if needed. Stir in a few gratings of nutmeg, grate in one-third of the cheese and season to how you like it., Layer the cheesy mash on top of the beans, carefully spreading it out to the edges in an even layer, then grate over the remaining cheese (I prefer mature Cheddar, but mild is fine too). Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the beans are hot through, the cheese is melted and golden, and it's bubbling at the edges. Serve with a crisp green salad and homemade coleslaw. This is my fail-safe go-to dish if I’m in need of a bit of naughty comfort food."

then trim and finely chop the leek and chilli (I leave the seeds in, but deseed if you prefer), and place into your largest, heavy-based pan over a medium heat with the oil. Fry for about 5 minutes, or until softened., Add the spices, dried herbs and a good grating of nutmeg, then fry for 2 minutes – if it’s a little dry at this point, simply add a splash of water to help it out. Stir in the tomato purée and cook for a further 2 minutes., Stir in the lentils. Drain, rinse and stir in the beans, followed by the chopped tomatoes and the stock (I try to use homemade stock, but if you’ve only got stock cubes, that’s fine too)., Bring it all to the boil, then reduce to a low heat and let it bubble away for at least 1 hour, or until thickened and reduced, stirring every 15 to 20 minutes, then season to how you like it., I like this with rice or on a jacket potato, scattered with coriander leaves and with lime wedges and a dollop of soured cream on the side."

Chop the courgettes into rough 2cm chunks and place in the bowl with the potatoes., Fill and boil the kettle., Once the vegetables are cooked, add the potatoes, courgettes and a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Crumble the stock cube (if using) into a measuring jug and carefully top up to 1.4 litres with boiling water and stir until dissolved. Carefully pour the hot stock into the pot., Turn the heat up to high and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until the potato is cooked through., Add the peas or beans and the spinach and cook for a further 4  minutes, or until the peas are tender., Carefully remove the pot to a heatproof surface and leave for a minute or two to stop bubbling., Carefully blitz with a stick blender until smooth (use a tea towel to protect your hands from little splashes). Have a taste and add a tiny pinch of salt and pepper if you think it needs it., Pick and roughly chop the mint leaves, discarding the stalks., Carefully ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle over the mint.

virgin olive oil","Wash the beetroots and carrots under cold running water, scrubbing with a scrubber to get rid of any dirt (there’s no need to peel them)., Pick off and discard the wispy ends from the beetroots., Hold a box grater steady on a chopping board, then gripping the root end, coarsely grate the carrots, stopping before your fingers or knuckles get too close to the grater. Place the grated carrots into a large bowl., Coarsely grate or finely slice the cabbage, then discard the core and add to the bowl., Remove the stalk from the pear, coarsely grate (core and all), then place it into the bowl., Finally, hold the root end of the beetroots and coarsely grate (you may want to wear rubber gloves for this), then add to the bowl., Pick the mint and parsley leaves, then discard the stalks. Tear or finely chop the leaves on a board and add to the bowl., Add all the dressing ingredients to a jam jar., Put the lid securely on the jar and shake well., Have a taste and see whether you think it needs a bit more yoghurt, vinegar or oil – you want it to be slightly too acidic, so that it’s still nice and zingy once you’ve dressed your rainbow salad., Drizzle most of the dressing over the salad – just remember you can always add more but you can’t take it away, so be cautious., Divide the salad between the tortilla wraps, then crumble a little feta over each., Roll up the wraps, tucking them in at the sides as you go, then serve."

Quarter and add the tomatoes along with 6 tablespoons of oil, the zest from half the lemon and most of the juice. Season, then set the dressing aside. Squeeze the remaining lemon juice over the white part of the onions and set aside., Pick and set aside the mint leaves, then tie the stalks together with string. Place the stalks and broad beans into a pan of boiling salted water, then blanch for around 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the broad beans to a bowl, discarding the mint stalks. Add the peas to the boiling water and blanch for 2 minutes., Meanwhile, pod any larger broad beans and add to the dressing, then drain and add the peas. Finely slice and add most of the mint leaves, then toss everything well to coat., Toast the sourdough in a griddle pan over a high heat. Halve the garlic and rub the cut side onto one side of the griddled bread, then rub over the rosemary. Sprinkle with a little salt and drizzle over some oil., Pile the peas and broad beans onto the dressed side of your toast. Sprinkle over the white spring onion and the reserved mint leaves, then grate the remaining lemon zest on top. Use a speed-peeler to shave the feta over the top, then serve."

Tear off a double layer of wide tin foil and place the celeriac in the middle, root side up., Rub with olive oil, sea salt and black pepper, sprinkle over the thyme sprigs and 6 bay leaves, then bash 4 whole cloves of garlic and scatter over. Pull the sides of the foil up really tightly around the celeriac and scrunch around its shape, leaving it open at the top., Place the butter on top of the celeriac so that it melts down and around it as it cooks, then fold the foil over really tightly to seal. Place in an ovenproof dish and roast for around 2 hours, or until tender., Meanwhile, cook the pearl barley at the appropriate time according to packet instructions., Peel and finely slice the onion and remaining garlic, place in a large frying pan on a low heat with a lug of olive oil, and fry for around 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Finely slice the mushrooms and add (your pan will be very full, but trust me, they will cook down nicely). Cook for around 20 minutes, or until golden, continuing to stir occasionally., Crumble in the stock cube, add the remaining bay leaf and pour in 200ml of boiling water. Simmer and reduce until the liquid has nearly gone, then stir in the cream and mustard and simmer for a further 5 minutes. Season to perfection and keep warm until needed, being careful not to let it get too thick., Around 10 minutes before the celeriac is ready, carefully open up the foil and start basting every couple of minutes with the melted butter for extra colour., Drain the pearl barley and dress it with salt, pepper and extra virgin olive oil. Place the celeriac on a board and carve thinly, like you would a joint of meat. Drizzle with any juices from the foil, then serve with the mushroom sauce, pearl barley and lots of beautiful seasonal greens."

Add a good pinch of sea salt, toss and scrunch it all together, then leave for 5 minutes., Meanwhile, mix the mustard, a good squeeze of lemon juice, and a couple of lugs of extra virgin olive oil with a little pinch of salt and black pepper in a medium bowl and put aside., Drizzle a really good lug of olive oil into a large bowl and add a good pinch of pepper. Handful by handful, squeeze the potato and carrot mixture to get rid of the excess salty liquid, then sprinkle into the bowl., Toss in the oil and pepper until well mixed, then evenly scatter it over a large oiled baking tray (roughly 30cm x 40cm). Roast for around 35 minutes, or until golden on top and super-crispy around the edges., Meanwhile, blanch the peas for a minute in a large pan of boiling salted water, then scoop out, add to the bowl of dressing and pile the spinach on top., Just before your rösti is ready, with the water gently simmering, crack in the eggs, poach to your liking, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon., Serve the rösti with the eggs on top. Quickly toss the salad together to dress it and scatter in piles on the rösti, then crumble over the feta and serve. I like to whack it in the middle of the table and let everyone dig in."

then finely slice with the chilli. Peel and chop the carrots. Put all these into a large roasting tray and place on a medium heat with a lug of oil, the paprika, cumin and chilli flakes. Cook for 20 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, scrub the sweet potatoes clean, then rub them with a little oil, sea salt and black pepper, place on a baking tray and put aside., When the time’s up, stir the passata into the tray, add a splash of water to the empty jar, swirl it around and pour it in along with the beans (juice and all). Drizzle over the BBQ sauce, season lightly and stir well., Pick and roughly chop the rosemary leaves, toss in a little oil and sprinkle over the top, then place in the oven for around 1 hour, or until bubbling, baked and gorgeous, adding a splash or two of water to loosen, if needed., Put the tray of sweet potatoes into the oven for the same amount of time, or until soft and cooked through., Around 20 minutes before the beans are ready, tear the bread into rough chunks and toss with a drizzle of oil in a roasting tray., Grate over the Cheddar (if using), then place on the bottom shelf of the oven for around 15 minutes, or until crispy and golden, to make croutons., Remove everything from the oven, tear up or squidge open the potatoes, and serve with the beans, dollops of yoghurt and the homemade croutons to mop up that delicious sauce, with a simple green salad on the side."

semolina, flour and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then gradually add the soda water, stirring continuously until the mixture comes together to form a stiff dough. Place into a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to stand for 30 minutes., Meanwhile, blitz all the pani ingredients, ½ a bunch of coriander, a pinch of salt and pepper and 200ml of water in a liquidiser until smooth. Line a sieve with a double layer of muslin, place over a large bowl, then pour in the tomato mixture and leave to strain – you’ll end up with a beautiful, intense, flavoured water., Meanwhile, make the green salsa. Roughly chop and add the ginger to a liquidiser with the remaining salsa ingredients. Blitz until smooth, then season to taste and transfer to a small bowl., For the spiced chickpeas, heat a lug of olive oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. Add the cumin, curry leaves and cinnamon, then fry for around 3 minutes, or until nicely toasted. Stir in the chickpeas, then add the tamarind paste or chutney and cook for a further 3 minutes to warm through, shaking the pan occasionally. Transfer to a plate and set aside., Shape the puri dough on a flour-dusted surface into a long sausage shape, roughly 40cm in length, then take small lumps of dough and roll into rough grape-sized pieces with your hands. Roll the dough out into thin, flat circles, roughly 7cm in diameter., Place a large, deep pan over a high heat, add the vegetable oil and allow it to get really hot. To test if it’s hot enough, drop a tiny piece of dough into the pan – if it floats to the surface and starts to sizzle, it’s about right. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower 3 to 4 dough circles into the pan. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until puffed up, using the spoon to push them under the oil, then carefully flip them over and continue cooking for 2 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain, then repeat with the remaining dough., Meanwhile, finely chop the fennel, radishes, onion and cucumber, then place into separate bowls., To serve the puris, smash a hole in the top and spoon some chickpeas, green salsa and chopped vegetables inside. Drizzle in a little of the pani, pick over a few of the remaining coriander leaves and tuck in."

Scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands, then pour in the porcini soaking liquor (discarding just the last gritty bit)., Season with sea salt and black pepper, bring to the boil, then simmer on a low heat for 1 hour, or until thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally., Trim the aubergines and peel with a speed-peeler, leaving a little of the skin to create a stripy effect, then slice into 1cm-thick rounds. Place in a colander, sprinkle with a good pinch of salt and leave in the sink to drain (the salt will draw out the moisture)., Peel the potatoes and slice into rough 1cm rounds, then parboil in a pan of boiling salted water for 5 minutes. Drain and leave to steam dry, then place in a large, deep roasting tray (30cm x 40cm)., Season, drizzle with oil and scatter over 1 heaped tablespoon of dried oregano. Toss well to coat, then roast in a single layer for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden and tender., Meanwhile, rinse the aubergines and pat dry with kitchen paper, then spread out across a few large roasting trays., Drizzle with oil, season with pepper and oregano, then roast alongside the potatoes for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through., Warm the milk with the remaining 2 bay leaves and the peppercorns in a pan on a medium-low heat – keep an eye on it. Before it boils, strain into a jug, then wipe out the pan and return to a medium heat., Melt the butter, then stir in the flour to form a paste. Start adding the hot milk, a splash at a time, stirring in each addition before adding more, until you have a smooth, creamy sauce., Crumble in one-third of the feta and grate in one-third of the kefalotyri, then simmer over a low heat for a further 5 minutes, or until thick and smooth. Leave to cool slightly., To assemble, spoon half the ragù over the tray of potatoes, then layer half the aubergines on top. Repeat with the remaining ragù and aubergines., Separate the eggs (saving the whites for another recipe). Whisk the yolks into the sauce, then pour over the aubergines. Crumble and grate over the remaining cheese, drizzle with oil, and bake for 40 minutes, or until golden., Leave to stand for 30 minutes, then serve. Great with a Greek salad."

Meanwhile, place the mayo into a bowl with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, the zest from the limes and the juice from 1. Mix well, taste and add a squeeze more juice, if needed. Spread the mayo onto a plate, then dust with the paprika or cayenne pepper and put to one side. Grate the cheese onto another large plate, then set aside also., Preheat a griddle pan over a high heat. Add the corn and griddle for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the husks are black and charred all over, turning occasionally – the husks will help to steam the corn until tender., Peel back the husks, keeping them intact at the base, then roll each cob into the lime-spiked mayo, before rolling into the cheese.

won’t believe how tasty the courgettes get with this method of cooking – it really does take them to another level. You’ve got to find some Lincolnshire Poacher, it’s an amazing cheese made by the very talented Jones brothers, Simon and Tim (see www.lincolnshirepoachercheese.com). The pastry is rich and amazing, so embrace the fact that it’s really crumbly and will definitely break as you’re making it. I’m serving this with a lemony salad and sweet salt-baked shallots, which will get caramelized and gorgeous and pick up the seasoning from the bed of salt. This method is also a great one for beetroots, so if you like this, try that., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Blitz the flour and butter in a food processor with a pinch of salt and a few good pinches of pepper until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip on to a work surface, make a well in the centre and add 100ml of cold water. Gently mix until it starts to come together, then – most importantly for a short, crumbly pastry – have the confidence to only just press, pat and almost hug it together to form a rough scruffy ball. Please don’t be tempted to knead the dough or it won’t be short and crumbly. Pop it into a floured bowl, cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge to chill while you make the filling., Put a drizzle of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat and pick in the leaves from half the bunch of thyme. Add a few gratings of nutmeg, the zest of half the lemon, the sliced courgettes and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Cook gently (the courgettes will cook down and become easier to handle), stirring occasionally, for around 25 minutes. Then turn the heat down to low and cook for another 20 minutes, so the courgette mixture becomes dense and the flavours really intensify and sweeten. Allow to cool a little, finely chop and crumble in the cheese, then chop and add the mint leaves. Set aside., Halve the pastry and roll each half into a circle just under 1cm thick and slightly larger than the pie dish you’ve chosen (roughly 23cm diameter x 4cm deep). Don’t worry if the pastry breaks up – that’s normal. Just patch it. Roll one of the circles around the rolling pin and carefully unroll it over the pie dish. Gently press the pastry into the corners and sides of the dish, then spoon and spread all your courgette mixture into the dish. Carefully unroll the pastry lid over the top, then flour your thumb and forefinger and gently pinch and crimp the edges together. Trim off any excess pastry and brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg., Now simply throw the rock salt into a roasting tray with the shallots, still with their skins on, and a few thyme tips. Put the pie right at the bottom of the oven, with the tray of shallots above. Cook for 1 hour, or until the pie is golden, then allow to cool and serve with those soft roasted shallots., PS: All the leftover salt from baking the shallots can be bashed up and reused."

a lug of rapeseed oil and the paste to a large pan over a low heat. Fry for around 5 to 10 minutes to really get the flavours going., Meanwhile, peel, core and roughly chop the apples, then add to the food processor along with the thyme, lovage and tarragon leaves, celery salt, ginger and nutmeg. Blitz well until smooth and add to the pan, with the cassia or cinnamon stick, bay and cloves. Cook for a further minute, then stir in the sugar and continue frying for a further 3 minutes, or until the sugar starts to dissolve and you have a thick brown paste., Pour in 285ml cold water and cook for a further 2 minutes, before adding all the remaining ingredients. Stir well and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until thickened slightly., Pour the sauce through a sieve into a large bowl, then pass through the sieve again so you get a really smooth sauce. Return the sauce to the pan and simmer over a low heat for around 10 minutes, until reduced by about a quarter (you want to end up with around 500ml, 1 serving=1 tablespoon)., Leave to cool completely, then either get marinating straight away, or divide between airtight, sterilised jars and it should keep for up to 6 months."

Peel, halve and finely slice the onions and put them into the large pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil., Crumble in the stock cube, add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, strip in the thyme leaves and squash in 2 unpeeled cloves of garlic through a garlic crusher., De-stalk the chestnut mushrooms and place the tops on the griddle pan, turning when charred., Tear the chestnut stalks and portobellos into the onion pan, add the rice and cook for a couple of minutes. Pour in 1 litre of boiling water and boil with the lid on., Cut 4 slices of ciabatta at an angle and add to the griddle pan. When charred on both sides, rub with a halved garlic clove., Coarsely grate or slice the apple into matchsticks and toss with the roughly chopped parsley and a little lemon juice., Place the chestnut mushrooms on the toasts, crumble over the stilton and walnuts, then pop under the grill until the cheese is melted., Use the stick blender to purée the soup to a consistency you like, then season to taste, if needed, and swirl in the cream and truffle oil., Top the toasts with pinches of apple and parsley and serve on the side."

Slice the squash lengthways into wedges and add to a large roasting tray with a good splash of olive oil, the chilli and cinnamon. Bash the coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar until fine, then add the rosemary leaves and bash again for 1 to 2 minutes to release its flavour. Scatter over the squash and toss together so that each piece of squash is well coated with the seasoning. Make sure all the squash is skin-side down, then cover with tin foil and bake in the hot oven for around 45 minutes or until soft. Allow to cool, then tear into bite-sized chunks., Meanwhile, heat a saucepan over a medium heat, then add a splash of olive oil and the onions. Season well with salt and pepper and cook gently, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned. Add the sage and crumbled chestnuts to the pan for the last few minutes of cooking., While that’s happening, toast the bread on a hot griddle pan or in a toaster and rub well with one of the cloves of garlic. Tear into small chunks, and once the onions are done, add the toast to the pan. Turn the heat off, stir everything together, taste, then season and grate in the zest of the lemon., Add the butter to a frying pan on a medium heat and when melted, add the mushrooms and a chopped clove of garlic. Fry until soft and quite dry. Squeeze in a little lemon juice, tip into a food processor and whiz until smooth., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the spinach and cook until soft. Drain in a colander, pressing lightly to get rid of excess moisture, then place to one side., Slice the remaining garlic clove and add to a frying pan with a splash of olive oil. Fry until golden. Add the pine nuts, sultanas and spinach and fry everything together until warmed through. Season well with salt and pepper and turn off the heat., Now assemble your Wellington. Roll out the puff pastry on a sheet of baking parchment until it’s about 30cm x 40cm, then spread the mushroom mixture all over it. In a large bowl, lightly toss together the spinach, squash and onion-bread mixture, then spoon it in a thick line down the middle of the pastry. Leave a space free at either side so you can roll the pastry around the filling., To do this, hold one side of the baking parchment and lift it, with the pastry, towards the centre of the Wellington so it starts to cover the filling. Peel the baking parchment back, leaving the pastry in place, then do the same with the other side. The pastry should overlap in the middle. Beat the egg with the milk and brush it over the pastry join to seal the join. Fold up the ends so the filling doesn’t leak out, then carefully roll the Wellington onto a baking sheet, with the seal underneath. Brush all over with the egg mix., Bake for 45 minutes until puffed up, golden brown and hot through. Serve carved into thick chunks – it’s fantastic served with veggie gravy!"

The jewel-like pomegranate seeds are a little burst of sourness which brighten the whole dish up and give it that great Christmassy vibe. Beautiful!, Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and set a griddle pan on a high heat. Lay the aubergines out in a single layer on a roasting tray. Bash the cumin seeds in a pestle and mortar until fine, then sprinkle the cumin over the aubergines with a good pinch of salt and pepper and a couple of lugs of olive oil. Toss well, then roast for 30 to 40 minutes, shaking halfway, until golden and sticky., Meanwhile, toast the bread on the hot griddle until lovely and charred, then rub with the cut sides of your garlic. Tear into bite-sized pieces and pop in a large bowl with the tomatoes and the spring onions., Squeeze the juice from half of your lemon into a clean jam jar, then pour in 3 times as much extra virgin olive oil. Season well. In a serving bowl, mix the harrisa with the juice of the remaining lemon half and pop to one side., When your aubergines are done, leave them to cool for 10 minutes, then tip them into the bowl with the ciabatta and add the parsley and rocket. Shake up your jam jar dressing then pour it over the salad and gently toss it all together. Transfer the salad to a large serving platter and crumble over the goats’ cheese. Scatter over a handful of pomegranate seeds and serve with the tangy harrisa on the side."

Place the pieces flat-side down on the barbecue and cook until golden brown., Wrap the aubergines and courgettes separately in double layers of foil with a good drizzle of olive oil, half the lemon juice, all of the zest and a good sprinkling of parsley (make parcels that look like Christmas crackers). Place them both on the cooler coals and, using long tongs, cover them completely with hot coals. Cook for 20 minutes until soft and slightly blackened. (Alternatively, brown the veg on a hot, dry griddle then cook the parcels in an oven preheated to 200°C/400°F/gas 6, for 20 minutes until soft)., Meanwhile, prick the chilli all over with a knife so it doesn’t explode. Blacken it on all sides over the barbecue (or directly over a gas hob) then wrap in clingfilm until cool. Peel, deseed and chop., Unwrap the foil parcels and place the veg on a board. Remove the stalk and skin from the aubergine, top and tail the courgettes, then chop the veg and add to a bowl. Dress with a lug of oil and the remaining lemon juice. Add the peeled and chopped garlic to the bowl, along with most of the chilli and mint.

Add the pancetta, onion and celery, place a lid on top and sweat gently until soft. Add the stock and bring to the boil., Remove the outer leaves off the corn on the cobs, then cut the kernels off with a sharp knife. The best way to do this is to stand the corn on its end and slice down the sides – but mind your fingers!, Leaving the kernels to the side for a moment, add the cobs and potato to the saucepan and bring the stock back to the boil, then simmer for about 10–15 minutes until the potato is cooked., Lift out the cobs with a pair of tongs and throw them away. Add the kernels and simmer for another 5 minutes. Taste the soup and season with salt and pepper if necessary, then whiz the soup with a hand-held blender until smooth., Stir in the cream and bring almost back to boil. Ladle into bowls, garnish with parsley if you like, and serve with some extra crispy pancetta and a piece of chilli cracker."

harissa paste, extra virgin olive oil","Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Place the squash, cumin and crumbled chilli on to a baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil, mix together and place in the preheated oven. Roast for 45 minutes until the squash is cooked through., Once the squash is roasted, heat a large saucepan and pour in a splash of oil. Add the celery, garlic, parsley stalks and two-thirds of the onion, and cook gently with a lid on until softened. Drop in the roasted squash and let it sweat for a few minutes, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the chickpeas and simmer for 15 minutes more., Meanwhile, toast the reserved squash seeds with the almond flakes, fennel, sesame and poppy seeds in a little olive oil until they are nicely coloured all over., Season the soup well and, using a hand-held blender, whiz for a few seconds so it thickens, but there are still some chunky bits. Keep warm while you mix together the lemon zest, chopped parsley leaves and mint leaves. Chop the remaining onion until it’s really fine, then mix into the zesty mixture., To serve, spoon half a teaspoon of harissa paste into each bowl. Divide the zesty herb mixture between the bowls and ladle over the soup. Stir each bowl once with a spoon, then sprinkle with the toasted seeds and almonds and finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

Heat a large saucepan and add a splash of olive oil. Add the leeks and sliced red onions, and sweat, slowly, until soft – about 10 minutes. Add the chopped spinach and briefly cook until wilted down. Set aside to cool slightly, then drain off any excess liquid in the pan., Mix the ricotta into the leek and onion mixture and season with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper., Spoon a quarter of the base tomato sauce into the bottom of 6 individual ovenproof dishes, or into a 3-litre ovenproof dish. Cover with sheets of lasagne. Spread half the leek and ricotta mixture over the lasagne, then add a third of the remaining tomato sauce. Repeat with more lasagne sheets, the remaining leek and ricotta mixture and then half the remaining tomato sauce. Finish with a final layer of lasagne sheets, then spread the rest of the tomato sauce over the top., Tear the mozzarella into small pieces and dot over the top of the lasagne. Sprinkle with the Parmesan. Place on a baking sheet and bake the individual lasagnes for 25–30 minutes or the large one for 45 minutes – they need to be cooked through and golden brown on top."

It keeps in so many of the vitamins lost by boiling, and can be done in stacked steamer baskets. Best of all, though, it only takes up one ring of your cooker!, The butters are easy to make and can be done way ahead. Keep any leftovers in your freezer and use a slice when you cook a steak. Don’t cook all the vegetables or you’ll have far too many – just pick your two favourites., Make the flavoured butters. If you are making the turnips, pound the garlic, chilli and sun-dried tomatoes to a paste in a pestle and mortar. Add seasoning and the butter and pound well. Dollop onto a sheet of greaseproof paper and roll into a cylinder, twisting the ends like Christmas crackers. Place in the freezer to firm up., For the carrots, pound the sugar, zest, cumin seeds and thyme; for the broccoli, the rosemary and anchovies; for the mangetout, mix the lemon juice and zest. Then add the seasoning and butter, pound and roll into Christmas cracker shapes, as before., Put the veg in a 2-layer steamer. Carrots should be nearest to the heat, then baby turnips, then broccoli florets, then mangetout. Steam for 10 minutes and serve each vegetable with circles of flavoured butter melted over the top."

Use a speed peeler to peel a courgette into ribbons. If you can get different colours of courgettes then having those colours together on the fork is a really nice touch. Take two ribbons in your hand and add a small chunk of feta cheese, a destoned green olive, a mint leaf and a tiny sprinkle of finely chopped fresh red chilli. Wrap everything up in the courgette ribbons then stab with a fork., Also try:

Pour all the rice and barley into a deep saucepan with the bulb of garlic and the herb stalks and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil and simmer gently for 20 minutes. If using farro cook for 30 minutes before adding the rice, as it needs around 50 minutes in total. Check the grains are soft to the bite then cook for 1 minute more. Drain through a sieve, saving the cooking water., Keep the grains in the sieve and place it over the saucepan containing the cooking water. Cover with a lid and place back on the heat so the grains steam for about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and tip the grains into a bowl to cool down., Pick out and discard the herb stalks, then pick out the garlic bulb and squeeze all the cloves so the garlic inside goes into a bowl. Lightly mash the garlic with the back of a fork. Chop the herb leaves and stir these into the garlic. Season well with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and plenty of extra virgin olive oil, and squeeze in the juice of the lemon. Stir this dressing through the cooled grains. Give it a taste and adjust the seasoning if you need to., Heat a splash of olive oil in a frying pan and add the fennel and cumin seeds and the oats. Stir and fry for a few minutes until the seeds start smelling fantastic and the oats are lightly toasted., Spoon the grain mixture into a serving dish, stirring through half of the spiced, toasted oats and sprinkling the rest over the top. Drizzle with a little more olive oil, scatter some chopped parsley over the top and serve."

My favourite way to eat it is with oily fish, such as mackerel or sardines. The rose petals are delicate and fragrant, and nicely balance the heat of the chillies.

If you can find some really wonderful-smelling roses, you’ll notice their fragrance will come through in the harissa. ”",43,2.2g,0.3g,5.1g,0.62g,1g,5.5g,0.4g,"350                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                ripe tomatoes, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                fresh red chillies, 4                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, olive oil, 2                                                                                                                                                                teaspoons                                                                                                                                                                cumin seeds, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                coriander seeds, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                smoked paprika, 1                                                                                                                                                                handful of                                                                                                                                                                rose petals, 3                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                rose water, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                caster sugar, red wine vinegar, extra virgin olive oil","Preheat the oven to 150°C/300°F/gas 2., Halve the tomatoes, then place cut-side up) in a large roasting tray with the chillies and unpeeled garlic cloves. Drizzle with olive oil, then season with sea salt and black pepper., Roast for 1 hour, giving the tray a little shake occasionally, then remove from the oven and leave to cool., Once the chillies are cool enough to handle, remove their stalks and deseed them (wear rubber gloves!). You can do this under running water, as it helps with washing the seeds away., Peel the garlic cloves and place in the food processor with the chillies. Pulse until roughly chopped, then add the cumin, coriander and paprika, season well with salt and pepper and pulse again., Add the tomatoes, rose petals (wash first), rose water and sugar, then pulse to a chunky paste., Transfer to a bowl and stir in a splash of red wine vinegar and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Have a taste – you want a good balance between the heat of the chillies, the smoky paprika, the sharpness of the vinegar and the fragrant rose petals – and adjust the seasoning, if needed., Spoon into a sterilised jar – it will keep in the fridge for up to a month."

Add the tomatoes, squash, 500ml of water and a pinch of salt and pepper to the vegetables., Bring to the boil and simmer gently for about 30 minutes until the squash is soft., Fish out the bay leaves and allow the sauce to cool slightly before blitzing with a hand-held blender until nice and smooth., Have a taste and season with a little more salt and pepper if needed."

It comes with quite a sweet dressing which compliments the bitterness of the leaves perfectly., A great little starter. You don’t need to buy expensive balsamic vinegar for this one – the cheap stuff is fine as you’ll be reducing it into a lovely dressing., Cut the radicchio into quarters. Grill in a dry, very hot griddle pan until nicely charred on all sides. Remove to a large bowl and griddle the slices of bread., To make the warm dressing, fry the sliced garlic, pine nuts and raisins in a little olive oil. When the garlic starts to colour, take the pan off the heat and pour in the balsamic vinegar. Most of the liquid will evaporate when it hits the hot pan, so you end up with a sticky dressing. Leave to cool a little., Roughly tear up the grilled radicchio and bread, and place back in the large bowl. Toss with the dressing, then squeeze out the dressing. Divide the radicchio and bread over your plates. Top with the rocket leaves, any pine nuts and raisins left in the bowl, and crumble the feta over the top."

from the wood. Serve it as a nice autumn supper with a lovely glass of Chianti, or as a starter for a dinner party., Don’t worry if you can't get hold of wild mushrooms – this works just as well with chestnut or field varieties. You can find scamorza, a delicious smoked mozzarella, at Italian delis and most supermarkets, but a good-quality buffalo mozzarella works just as well., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Heat a griddle pan and toast the ciabatta slices until they have lovely dark griddle marks. Tear up the toasted bread into chunks or, if using carta di musica, break up into pieces and toss with a drizzle of olive oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Get yourself a medium-sized earthenware dish, drizzle it with a little olive oil then add the seasoned, toasted bread., In the same bowl you used for the bread, add the sliced garlic, chopped bacon and thyme leaves, then tear over the mushrooms, leaving any little ones whole. Crumble in the dried chilli, then use your hands to toss everything together and get all those wonderful flavours going., Sprinkle this mixture fairly evenly on top of the bread, then tear over big pieces of the scamorza. Give the whole lot one final drizzle of olive oil, and put it in the oven to bake for about 30 minutes, until the mushrooms are beginning to crisp up and the cheese is melted, bubbling and starting to brown., While that bakes, wash and dry the salad leaves, and make a simple dressing by squeezing the juice of half a lemon into a jam jar. Top with twice as much extra virgin olive oil, and add a good pinch of salt and pepper. Put the lid on and give it a good shake, then put it to one side., Once the mushrooms are ready, drizzle some of your jam-jar dressing over the salad (any leftover dressing will keep happily in the fridge for a few days). Serve your beautiful, baked mushrooms and salad in the middle of the table and let everyone dig in."

Give it your own spin with extra herbs and spices. 

If your tomato plants are groaning under the weight of all their ripe fruit, or even if you’ve just got some over-ripe tomatoes to use up, then this is a great soup to have up your sleeve. As long as your tomatoes are really ripe you’ll end up with a wonderfully sweet soup no matter what type of tomatoes you’ve used. The basil oil is also great for drizzling over salads, pastas or pizzas so if you want to keep it for a couple of weeks, just strain it through a sieve and store it in a sterile jar. ”",225,19.4g,3g,10.4g,0.26g,2.6g,10.7g,3.4g,"olive oil, 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 2                                                                                                                                                                kg                                                                                                                                                                very ripe mixed tomatoes, good-quality red wine vinegar, BASIL OIL, 1                                                                                                                                                                large bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil                                                                                                                                                                , (30g), 200                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                extra virgin olive oil","To make the basil oil, pick the basil leaves and finely chop the stalks. Put a few leaves in a bowl of cold water for later, then place the rest in a pestle and mortar. Add a pinch of sea salt and bash the basil leaves until they have broken down into a dark green paste. Transfer the paste to a jug and add your extra virgin olive oil. Mix together well., To make the soup, add a lug of olive oil to your biggest pan over a medium heat. Peel and slice the garlic and add to the pan with the basil stalks. Fry for about a minute then add all the tomatoes. Stir in 150ml of water and bring to the boil. Reduce to a medium heat and let the tomatoes cook for 5 minutes until they are slightly broken down. If your tomatoes are nice and ripe they’ll be naturally sweet and soft, which means you won’t need to cook the soup for too long., Remove the soup from the heat, add a splash of red wine vinegar then carefully blitz with a hand blender until you get a consistency that’s to your liking., Serve in warm bowls with a spoonful of bright green basil oil swirled on top and sprinkled with the reserved basil leaves. You can even eat any leftovers cold from the fridge for a really fresh, light soup."

In fact, they’re so delicious I end up eating them as soon as they come out of the pan, so not all of them make it to the table! You can use one type of mushroom – like I’ve done here with the field mushrooms – or a mixture. Tearing them up into different sizes will add a wonderful mixture of textures, colours and flavours., Start by making your posh, flavoured vinegar. Put the whole sprigs of tarragon and thyme, the peppercorns and garlic slices into a bottle, then top with the vinegar, making sure it completely covers all the herbs and spices. Allow the vinegar to steep for at least a few hours and, remember, the longer you leave it, the more delicious it will become. You can let it infuse for a couple of weeks to really push up the flavour and, as long as you strain the vinegar after this time and bottle it up, you can keep using it for a good few months., Fill a deep pan with the olive oil and let it heat up over a medium heat. Meanwhile, put the flour on a large plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and the lemon zest. Cut or tear the mushrooms into uneven chunks, and sprinkle them with a bit of water to moisten them. Toss handfuls of the mushrooms in the seasoned flour until they are all lightly coated., To test if the oil is hot enough, add a small piece of potato to the pan. Once it begins to sizzle and brown, the oil is ready. Deep-fry the mushrooms in batches – about a handful at a time - until they’re golden brown. The cooking time will depend on the size of the mushrooms but it shouldn’t take more than 3 or 4 minutes – just use your instincts. Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and leave on kitchen paper to drain for a minute. Serve as soon as possible sprinkled with a pinch of salt, some posh vinegar and some roughly chopped parsley. Delicious!"

Let it mellow in a dark cool cupboard for 1 month before eating., This is the best piccalilli I’ve ever had. Pile it onto your plate with a ploughman’s or spice up ham and colcannon with a generous dollop.

Put all the vegetables in a bowl, add the salt and enough water to cover. Leave in a cool place for about 1 hour., Heat a saucepan big enough to hold all the vegetables. Add the mustard oil to the pan, then fry the mustard seeds, cumin, turmeric and nutmeg for a moment. Lower the heat, add the mustard powder, flour and a splash of vinegar. Stir well to make a thick paste. Gradually add the remaining vinegar and 100ml water, stirring all the time to make a smooth paste. Add the apples, mangoes, sugar, garlic, oregano and bay leaves. Cook for 2–3 minutes., Drain the salted vegetables and add them to the pan, stirring well to coat with the spicy paste. Cook for 10–15 minutes until the vegetables have just softened and started to release some juice. Spoon into sterilized jars (see the how to video below) and close the lids tightly."

It looks wicked in little tea cups with chilli, coriander and fresh coconut sprinkled on the top., Roughly chop the squash into big chunks, then set aside. Whiz the lime leaves, if using, 3 of the chillies, the garlic, ginger, lemongrass, coriander stalks, Chinese five spice and cumin to a dryish paste in a food processor. Discard the stringy bits, if any., Heat the oil in a deep saucepan over a medium-low heat. Add the spice paste and onion and cook gently for about 10 minutes, stirring to release the flavours. Add the squash and stock, and stir around, scraping all the goodness off the bottom of the pan. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, with the lid on, for about 15 minutes, until the squash is soft and cooked., Pour in the rice and give it a really good stir – the squash might begin to break up, but it doesn’t matter. Continue to simmer, covered, for 12 minutes, until the rice is just cooked., Add the coconut milk, stir again, taste and season carefully. Bring back to a simmer, then add the lime juice, to taste. Spoon into tea or coffee cups and decorate with the fresh coriander leaves, the remaining sliced chilli and some shaved fresh coconut, if using."

Then add the olive oil very gradually, drop by drop – once you’ve blended in a quarter of the oil, add the rest a little more quickly, whisking all the time. Pound the garlic with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar and add to the mayonnaise. Season with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice., Slice the cooked potatoes in half and dress with 8 heaped tablespoons of the garlic mayonnaise (keep the leftovers in a jar in the fridge for up to 3 days.). Turn the cress punnets on their sides and slice the cress stalks near the base. If the cress is a bit dirty, give it a good wash before folding into the dressed potatoes. Then tuck in and enjoy!"

Bring back to the boil for 1 minute, then remove the florets with a slotted spoon and leave in a colander. Keep the cauliflower water to one side., Heat a wide pan big enough to hold all the ingredients at once. Add a good splash of vegetable oil and when it’s hot, add the mustard seeds, the asafoetida, the curry leaves and turmeric. Fry for a few seconds then add the diced potatoes, just enough of the cauliflower water to cover them and some salt. Cover with a lid and simmer gently until the potatoes are just cooked. Add the peas, chillies and cauliflower florets, stir and replace the lid. Cook over a gentle heat until everything is cooked and soft, and the liquid has reduced. Taste and season well with salt and pepper, sprinkle with loads of chopped coriander and some coconut shavings and serve."

Its proper name is 'bagna cauda', which basically means ‘hot bath’ in Italian, and the idea is that you have a load of raw or just-cooked pieces of vegetable that you dip into a delicious, warm sauce. You may like your sauce to be thick and oozy but I prefer mine to be quite delicate, like the texture of thin custard, with a lovely sheen to it. ”",477,44.1g,7g,9.9g,1.06g,8.7g,11.9g,5.5g,"Sauce, 6                                                                                                                                                                cloves                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 300                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                milk, 10                                                                                                                                                                                                                    anchovy fillets in oil                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources, 180                                                                                                                                                                ml                                                                                                                                                                extra virgin olive oil                                                                                                                                                                , plus extra for drizzling, 2-3                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                white wine vinegar, Vegetables, a few                                                                                                                                                                                                                    young carrots, a few                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                raw beetroots, ½                                                                                                                                                                                                                    celeriac, 1                                                                                                                                                                bulb                                                                                                                                                                fennel, a few                                                                                                                                                                sticks                                                                                                                                                                celery, ½                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                Romanesco or white cauliflower, 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch                                                                                                                                                                radishes, 1                                                                                                                                                                handful                                                                                                                                                                small beetroot leaves","First, prepare all your veg, because once the sauce is done you’ll be ready to serve! Peel and finely slice the carrots, beetroot, celeriac and fennel, reserving the herby fennel tops., Trim and thinly slice the celery, reserving the yellow leaves. Break the cauliflower into florets., Trim the radishes and wash with the beetroot leaves., To make your sauce, peel the garlic cloves and put into a saucepan with the milk and anchovies, then bring to the boil. Simmer slowly for 10 minutes, or until the garlic is soft and tender, keeping a close eye on the pan to make sure the milk doesn’t boil over. Don’t worry if it spits and looks a little lumpy – simply remove from the heat and whiz the sauce up with a hand blender., Gently blend in the extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar a little at a time – you’re in control of the consistency at this point. If you like it thick, like mayonnaise, keep blending. Now taste it and adjust the seasoning. Make sure there’s enough acidity from the vinegar to act like a dressing. It should be an incredible, pungent warm sauce., There are two ways you can serve the warm sauce. Either pour the sauce into a bowl and place this on a plate, with the veg arranged around the bowl, or serve the veg in a big bowl and drizzle the sauce over the top., Sprinkle over the reserved herby fennel tops and celery leaves, then finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

I use my regular porridge-for-four-people pan and it works a treat! Add the onion, garlic, chopped cauliflower stalk and a lug of oil to the pan and slowly fry for 10 minutes until softened and with a little colour. Add the olives, anchovies and parsley stalks and fry for another couple of minutes. Add your tomatoes, then half-fill one of the tins with water and add that to the pan, with a good swig of red wine vinegar. Stir everything together, breaking the tomatoes down with a spoon to make sure there are no big lumps, and bring to the boil., Take your cauliflower and gently push it down into the sauce. If you’ve got the size of your pan right, half of the cauliflower will be in the sauce, half above it. Drizzle with olive oil, put the lid on and let it tick over on a low heat for 50 minutes. Serve sprinkled with the parsley leaves. Again, this is a pretty well-behaved dish when it comes to cooking it in advance and then reheating it just before you want to serve it. Lovely with roast lamb, and it’s also a delicious main course for a vegetarian if you leave out the anchovies."

You may have tried a Parma ham, rocket and Parmesan salad with a little balsamic, but by adding warm roasted squash and trying it with pecorino, which is slightly smoother than Parmesan, it’s a real pleasure and even feels a bit posh., Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Carefully cut your butternut squash in half, keeping the seeds intact. Remove the two ends and discard them. Cut each half into quarters and lay in a roasting tray. Rub with a little olive oil. In a pestle and mortar pound up a flat teaspoon each of salt, pepper and your chilli and coriander seeds. Scatter this over the squash. Roast the squash for half an hour or until soft and golden. Allow to cool a little., Lay your prosciutto on 4 plates — let it hang over the rim of the plates and encourage it to twist and turn so it doesn’t look neat and flat. Tear up your warm squash and put it in and around the ham. Sprinkle over the seeds and the rocket. Drizzle over the olive oil and balsamic, add a tiny pinch of salt and pepper, and use a vegetable peeler to shave over the Pecorino. Easily done."

This is ideal for a light lunch served with grilled fish or meat, or treated as a warm salad in part of a bigger spread., Let your barbecue die down ready to cook or put a griddle pan on a high heat to get nice and hot. Slice the aubergine about 1cm thick, slice the fennel bulb at an angle about 3mm thick, then slice the courgettes lengthways in about the same thickness as the fennel. Snap the woody ends off of the asparagus. Leave the peppers and patty pans, if using, whole., Pile everything onto a large tray ready to cook. In batches, add the veg to your barbecue or hot griddle to cook for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until charred, soft and delicious. Remember that each vegetable will cook in a different amount of time so keep checking and turning everything and as soon as it is looking good, transfer it to a large bowl (keeping the cooked peppers and patty pans to one side) and get the next lot of veg on., Carefully remove the black skin on the peppers, open them up and scrape away the seeds. Don’t worry about getting all of the skin off but do the best you can. This is a messy job but totally worth it! Tear the peppers up into strands and add to the bowl. Halve the patty pans and add those too, along with the extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar and a good pinch of salt and pepper.

Check the curry after 30 minutes and, if it still looks too liquidy, remove the lid for the rest of the cooking time., When the veg is tender, taste and season to perfection with sea salt, black pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice., Delicious served with poppadoms or fluffy rice and with a few dollops of natural yoghurt, a sprinkle of coriander leaves and a few lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Stir with a wooden spoon or a whisk to make a bright yellow batter. Add the salt, then put to one side., Cut the cucumber into long ribbons with a speed peeler and keep to one side. To make the dressing, mix the yoghurt with the coriander and the juice of 1 of the lemons. Add a splash of olive oil, season, and put to one side., Cut the leek, carrots, spring onions and red onions into thin strips - try to get them the size of long matchsticks. Mix with the chillies and the ginger., Pour the oil into a large non-stick frying pan and heat until very hot. Mix the vegetables, a little at a time, with some of the batter. Add a pinch of mustard seeds and scoop out a tablespoon of the coated vegetables. Press flat with the back of a fork and carefully drop into the hot oil. Repeat with the remaining vegetables - you may have to fry the bhajis in batches. Move them around a little in the hot oil (with a pair of tongs) to make sure they aren't sticking together. Fry for a minute or so on each side until crispy, then drain on kitchen paper. Place some rocket and cucumber ribbons on individual plates, drizzle with the yoghurt dressing and top with 2 or 3 bhajis. Serve with the lemon wedges."

Wash the sweet potatoes and bake them, in their skins, in the preheated oven until cooked and soft. Allow to cool (leaving the oven on), then peel and mash them., Bash up 1 teaspoon of the coriander seeds and the chillies in a pestle and mortar. Stir with the cinnamon into the mashed sweet potato and season well. Fold the spring onions and beaten egg into the mashed potato., Gently melt the butter in a pan. Bash up the remaining coriander seeds. Brush a sheet of filo with some melted butter and sprinkle with a pinch of ground cinnamon and a little of the ground coriander. Cover with the second sheet, and brush and sprinkle as before. Repeat for the third sheet. With a sharp knife, cut the stacked filo sheets into two 15cm squares., Working quickly to prevent the pastry from drying, do the same with the remaining filo sheets. You should now have four squares of filo. Place a generous tablespoon of the sweet potato mixture in the centre of each square and spread out slightly.  Brush the edges of each square with water and fold in half, corner to corner, to make a triangle. Press down at the edges to seal. Brush both sides of each triangle with the rest of the melted butter, place on a baking tray and bake in the preheated oven until light brown - this will take about 10 minutes., Mix the red onion with the watercress, mint and parsley. Mix the yoghurt with the lemon juice, a lug of olive oil and the cumin. Dress the salad with the yoghurt dressing and serve with the hot filo briks and the lemon halves."

Now what you need to do is trim back your artichoke leaves one by one, clicking them off until you get to the lovely paler yellow and more tender leaves. Using a pointed teaspoon, insert it right into the centre of the artichoke flower and slowly turn it to remove the fluffy choke. Have a little peer in and try to remove most of the choke. Rub the artichoke with lemon to stop it discolouring. You'll get the hang of it when you do the rest. You'll be left with 8 whole trimmed artichokes., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Toss the garlic, almonds, breadcrumbs and herbs into a bowl, season, and loosen with a little olive oil. Scrunch together with your hands and stuff this mixture into the middle of each artichoke, really packing it in. You want to fit these snugly side by side in an appropriately-sized baking dish. Sprinkle any excess filling over the top, drizzle generously with extra virgin olive oil and pour in your wine. Rip off a big enough piece of greaseproof paper, wet and scrunch it under a tap, then tuck it over the artichokes and round the edges of the dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then remove the greaseproof paper and bake for a final 10 minutes. Serve in the middle of the table with seafood or any white meat."

Get a large casserole-type pan nice and hot, then add a good couple of lugs of olive oil and your fresh mushrooms. Stir around very quickly for a minute, then add your garlic, onion and thyme and a small amount of seasoning. After about a minute you'll probably notice moisture cooking out of the mushrooms and at this point add half of your porcini, chopped up, and the rest left whole. Strain the soaking liquid to remove any grit, and add it to the pan. Carry on cooking for about 20 minutes until most of the moisture disappears., Season to taste, and add your stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for around 20 minutes. I usually remove half the soup from the pan and whiz it up to a purée at this point, then pour it back in, adding the parsley and mascarpone, and seasoning carefully to taste., You can serve this soup as you like, but there are a few things to remember when finishing it off. Mix together a pinch of salt and pepper with the zest of one lemon and the juice of half of it, then spoon a little of this into the middle of the soup. When you go to eat it, stir it in and it gives a wonderful flavour. Other things you can consider are little slices of grilled crostini put into the bottom of the bowls before the soup is poured over. Or you could even quickly fry some nice-looking mushrooms – like girolles, chanterelles or oysters – and sprinkle these on top of the soup. If I was going to use truffle oil, then I would use it on its own – a few drips on the top just before serving.

Pick the basil leaves and tear into pieces., Place a large non-stick frying pan on the heat and pour in 4 generous lugs of olive oil. Add the garlic, shake the pan around a bit and, once the garlic begins to colour lightly, add the basil and the tomatoes. Using the back of a wooden spoon, mush and squash the tomatoes as much as you can., Season the sauce with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. As soon as it comes to the boil, remove the pan from the heat., Strain the sauce through a coarse sieve into a bowl, using your wooden spoon to push any larger bits of tomato through. Discard the basil and garlic that will be left in the sieve, but make sure you scrape any of the tomatoey goodness off the back of the sieve into the bowl., Pour the sauce back into the pan, bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer for 5 minutes to concentrate the flavours.

But, if you’ve got a big crowd for Christmas then this gratin is an exciting and quite luxurious way of serving potatoes. You could either make them instead of, or as well as, your roast potatoes., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Butter the inside of an ovenproof dish, around 30cm x 30cm, and at least 6cm deep., Pour the milk and cream into a wide pan with the bay leaves and garlic. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for a minute or two. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper., Add the potatoes and most of the thyme leaves and stir well. Spoon into the gratin dish and shake to even everything out. Sprinkle with the Parmesan then cover with an oiled piece of foil. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes., Meanwhile, fry the bacon in a little olive oil until crispy and golden. Add the remaining thyme and stir in the chestnuts. When your gratin is ready, remove the foil and spoon the bacon and chestnut mixture over the top. Pop it back in the oven for another 10 minutes until gorgeous and crispy on top."

If you're using beetroot or celeriac, peel these. Remove the outer leaves of the cabbage, if using., Shred the carrots, fennel, and your choice of radishes, beetroot, turnip or celeriac on a mandolin (use the guard), or use the julienne slicer in your food processor. Put the veg into a mixing bowl., Peel the onion and shallot, and slice as finely as you can, along with the cabbage, if using. Add these to the bowl of veg., In a separate bowl, mix half the lemon juice, a lug of extra virgin olive oil, yoghurt and mustard. Pick the herb leaves and chop, then stir into the dressing., Pour the dressing over the veg and mix well to coat everything. Season to taste with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and the rest of the lemon juice, if you like., Really delicious served with thinly sliced leftover roast lamb, pork or rare roast beef, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil."

are endless! Their flavour goes well with chilli, nutmeg and sage. If you’ve never cooked one before, you’re in for a real treat., Preheat the oven to 230ºC/450ºF/gas 8. Cut the lid off the pumpkin and reserve it. Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and keep them to one side. Make the hollow where the seeds were a little bigger by scooping out some more pumpkin flesh. Finely chop this pumpkin flesh and one of the garlic cloves. Heat a frying pan over a medium heat. Pour in a splash of olive oil, then add the chopped pumpkin, chopped garlic, onion, olives, and half the rosemary. Cook gently for 10 minutes or so until the pumpkin has softened., Meanwhile, place the whole garlic clove and the remaining rosemary in a pestle and mortar. Crumble in the dried chilli, add a good pinch of salt, pepper, nutmeg and cinnamon and bash until you have a paste. Add a little olive oil to loosen up the mixture and then rub the inside of the pumpkin with it., Season the cooked pumpkin mixture and stir in the rice, cranberries, pistachios and tangerine zest with a pinch each of nutmeg and cinnamon. Mix thoroughly then add the vegetable stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 3 minutes (no longer or the rice will end up overcooked later)., Tear off a sheet of tin foil that’s large enough to wrap the pumpkin in a double layer and lay on top of a baking tray. Place the pumpkin on top and spoon the rice mixture into it, then place its lid back on. Rub the skin with a little olive oil, wrap it up in the foil and bake in the oven for about an hour. The pumpkin is ready when you can easily push a knife into it. Bring it to the table and open it up in front of everyone. Cut it into thick wedges and tuck in, leaving the skin. Serve with seasonal greens."

 caster sugar","When I was little, a gym opened around our way and it had a juice bar where they served this amazing carrot cake with a twangy sour cream topping. This is one of my efforts at making boring old carrot cake remotely credible. My mate Peter Begg, the friendly Scotsman, suggested I swap carrot for beetroot, which I did, and the result was marvellous. Thanks Pete!, Preheat the oven to 180˚C/350˚F/gas 4. Peel your beetroots then coarsely grate them into a bowl. Add the ginger, egg yolks, honey and olive oil in a bowl and add the seeds from 1 vanilla pod. Whisk together, then add the baking powder, polenta, orange zest and juice, salt, allspice, cinnamon and flour. In a separate bowl beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them into the beetroot mixture., Get yourself a 25cm cake tin or cheesecake mould. Rub with butter and dust with a little flour to stop the cake sticking. You could also line it with greaseproof paper to be really sure. Pour in the mixture then bake in the preheated oven for around 35 minutes until spongy. Test whether it's ready by poking a cocktail stick into it – if it's clean when it comes out you know the cake's done. Allow to cool., Whisk the crème fraîche with the vin santo, sugar and the seeds from the remaining vanilla pod. Taste and adjust to your liking with a bit more sugar and vin santo. Serve the cake in wedges with a big dollop of the vin santo and vanilla cream."

Deseed and finely chop the chilli. Pick and finely chop the rosemary., Heat a couple of lugs of olive oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat, add the sage leaves and fry for 30 seconds, or until crisp, then remove to kitchen paper., Place the pan of flavoured oil back on the heat, add the onion, carrot, garlic, celery, chilli, rosemary and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then cook gently for 10 minutes, or until sweet and soft., Meanwhile, halve, deseed and rough chop the squash. When the time's up, add the squash and stock to the pan. Bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes., For the croutons, drizzle a little olive oil over the ciabatta, pat it in, then finely grate and press some grated Parmesan on to each side. Place in a dry, non-stick pan and fry until golden on both sides., When the squash is tender, whiz the soup with a stick blender or pour it into a blender and pulse to a smooth purée – leave it slightly chunky, if you prefer., Season to perfection with salt and pepper, then divide between bowls, placing 2 croutons on top of each., Sprinkle with a few crispy sage leaves and drizzle with a swirl of quality extra virgin olive oil, then serve."

You can halve the cherry tomatoes or leave them whole. Then sprinkle them all with a good dusting of sea salt. Put them in a colander and leave them for 30 minutes. What's going to happen here is that the salt will draw the excess moisture out of the tomatoes, intensifying their flavour. Don't worry about the salad being too salty, as a lot of the salt drips away., Place the tomatoes in a large bowl and dress with enough extra virgin olive oil to loosen (approximately 6 tablespoons), and 1–2 tablespoons of vinegar, but do add these to your own taste. Toss around and check for seasoning – you may or may not need salt but will certainly need pepper. Add the garlic. Now start to add the horseradish. Stir in a couple of teaspoons to begin with, toss around and taste. If you like it a bit hotter, add a bit more horseradish. All I do now is get some finely sliced flat-leaf parsley (stalks and leaves) and mix this into the tomatoes. Toss everything together and serve as a wonderful salad, making sure you mop up all the juices with some nice squashy bread., This salad is fantastic with roast beef, goat's cheese or jacket potatoes. And to be honest, even if you put these tomatoes in a roasting tray and roasted them with some sausages scattered around them it would be nice."

Throw in the chopped onion and celery. Turn the heat down and cook very gently with the lid on for 10 minutes, or until the onion has softened, but not browned., Add the potato and stock and bring to the boil. Simmer for 10 minutes or until the potato is cooked. Next, drop in the peas and watercress and simmer for a further 5 minutes until the peas are cooked., Remove the pan from the heat. Whiz the soup with a hand blender, or in a liquidizer, until smooth. Taste, then season with salt and pepper., Serve the soup with a spoonful of soured cream swirled in, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some crusty bread and butter., Tip: You can use frozen peas – just simmer them in the stock a couple of minutes"

Once that's done, finely slice your chillies then roughly chop your tomatoes, mixing them in with the onion and chillies. Scrape all of this, and the juice, into a bowl and dress with the juice of half a lemon and 3 tablespoons of good extra virgin olive oil. Season to taste. Heat the chickpeas in a pan, then add 90 per cent of them to the bowl. Mush up the remaining chickpeas and add these as well – they will give a nice creamy consistency. Allow to marinate for a little while and serve at room temperature., Just as you're ready to serve, give the salad a final dress with the fresh mint and basil. Taste one last time for seasoning – you may want to add the juice from your remaining lemon half at this point. Place on a nice serving dish and crumble over the feta cheese."

A lot of the veg stalls have massive cauldrons of boiled potatoes and artichokes to serve to their customers – I guess you could say this is the original fast food – and they tasted absolutely brilliant., Some of the stalls also make a version of this salad, which is absolutely delicious. They tend to dress it and have it hanging around for quite some time so it becomes a bit sloppy and past its best, but the principle of the salad is fantastic and all the locals absolutely adore it. In Sicily you can get these terrific Cedro lemons which are mainly pith and they are amazing in salads – but you may not be able to get hold of them. In this case I wouldn't recommend you use normal lemons as the flavour is quite different., The way potatoes are cooked in Sicily is very long and very slow, on a low simmer with plenty of salt in the water. This is a fantastic method of making normal potatoes soft and floury, but in the case of new potatoes it would be a crime. So add them to fast-boiling salted water, as this will help retain a lot of their flavour, and cook them till nice and tender. The softer you can get them while still holding their shape, the better. While the potatoes are cooking, wash all your salad leaves and put them into a nice big bowl with the mint and fennel. If using a Cedro lemon, add the slices to the salad at this point., For the dressing, mix the orange juice and vinegar in a glass jar or bowl with about twice as much extra virgin olive oil. Add the oregano and capers and season to taste with salt and pepper. Give it a good mix and have a taste. Don't forget that you want the flavour to be a little over the top, so that by the time you've dressed the salad with it and it has mixed with all the other flavours it's perfect because it's become more subtle. Drain the potatoes when cooked, then allow them to steam in a colander for 5 minutes. Throw them into the salad while still warm and toss together well. Absolutely fantastic – great with a plate of grilled fish or as a lunchie salad on its own."

Peel and finely slice the red onion, and mix with the garlic, chilli and spring onion., Shred the mangetout, slice the mushrooms and water chestnuts, and mix with the shredded cabbage in a separate bowl to the onion mixture., Heat your wok until it’s really hot. Add a splash of oil – it should start to smoke – then the chilli and onion mix. Stir for just 2 seconds before adding the other mix. Flip and toss the vegetables in the wok if you can; if you can’t, don’t worry, just keep the vegetables moving with a wooden spoon, turning them over every few seconds so they all keep feeling the heat of the bottom of the wok. Season with sea salt and black pepper., After a minute or two, the vegetables should have begun to soften. Add the soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and stir in. After about 30 seconds the vegetables should smell amazing! Tip on to a serving dish, sprinkle over some sesame seeds and tuck in."

a great way to cook aubergines, and probably one that not a lot of people would think of doing. To me, steamed aubergine sounds horrible but, believe me, this recipe is fantastic. Aubergines are usually fried or roasted, which makes them soak up loads of oil, but steaming means they go really soft and tender so that they're lighter to eat – which means you can eat a lot more! All round the world there are so many different varieties of aubergines – long, round, purple, green – so keep your eyes peeled and try cooking them all., Put some water in a pan and bring it to the boil. Slice the aubergines in half lengthways and place them in your steamer with the cut side facing up. Steam them for about 10 minutes – to check whether they're ready, simply squeeze the sides gently and if they're silky soft then they're done. Remove them from the steamer, place them in a colander and leave to cool., Now make your dressing by mixing all the ingredients together. When the aubergines are warm this is the perfect time to flavour them. Cut them up into rough 2.5cm dice, then dress them and toss. Serve immediately as a salad, tapas dish or as a vegetable next to any simple cooked fish. Just really tasty!"

180°C/350°F/gas 4. Halve the squash, deseed, then cut into 8 slices or chunks (skin on) and put into a roasting tray. Bash up the dried chilli and a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar. Sprinkle over the squash, drizzle with olive oil and bake for 40 minutes., Finely chop or whiz the chillies, garlic, ginger and coriander stalks in a food processor. Add the sesame oil, lime juice, zest and fish sauce and whiz to a thin paste., Heat a large pan or wok. Pour in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and quickly stir in the paste. Cook for about a minute before adding the coconut milk and chicken stock., Turn the heat down and simmer for about 15 minutes. Taste – you may need to add fish sauce, lime juice or a bit of salt and pepper., Add the noodles to the soup, simmer for a few minutes, then divide between 4 bowls. Break over 2 pieces of squash. If you like, top with sliced red chilli and cress., Tip: For a quick fix, use a good laksa paste instead of making your own."

  , leaves picked","Vignole, or vignarola, is a Roman word to describe this incredible stew which is a celebration of spring. Please please try it – you will end up making it forever! If you don’t have any chicken stock to hand, just use some of the water you cooked the beans, leeks and chard in. You can leave the cooked prosciutto in or take it out before serving it, as you like. This is absolutely lovely tossed into cooked, drained pasta. And you must try it with asparagus if you can., Put the artichokes into a pot of cold salted water and bring to the boil. Cook for about 10 minutes or until tender (check by inserting a knife into the heart) and drain. Allow to cool, then peel back the outer leaves till you reach the pale tender ones and remove the choke using a teaspoon. Tear the hearts into quarters., Fill the pot with water again, add some salt and bring to the boil. Blanch the broad beans for a minute, then remove from the water with a slotted spoon and drain. Blanch the leeks for 3 or 4 minutes until tender, and the spinach or chard until just wilted., Heat a large saucepan, big enough to hold all the ingredients, and add a good splash of oil. Cook the onion very gently for about 10 minutes until soft, add the chicken stock and the peas and bring back to the boil. Lay the slices of prosciutto over the top and simmer gently for about 10 minutes until the peas are cooked and soft, and the prosciutto has flavoured them nicely., Tear the leeks into strips and stir them into the peas with the roughly chopped spinach or chard, the artichokes and the broad beans. Bring back to simmering point and let all the vegetables stew together very slowly for about 10 more minutes., Taste, season with salt and pepper, and stir in the chopped herbs and a good few lugs of olive oil before serving."
Spring minestrone | Jamie Oliver vegetable recipes,With fresh pesto,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/89080414.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '6']",In45 minutes,"“There’s a whole world of minestrones out there — most of which follow very strict, authentic recipes. Personally, I feel that a minestrone should always reflect the seasons: more cabbagy, frumpy ones in the winter and lighter, more colourful ones in the spring and summer. A minestrone can also be a whole meal if you want it to be, with pasta, stale bread or rice to bulk it out. To complement the spring vegetables, I’ve put a bit of a Genoese twist on it, with a spoon of fresh pesto added at the last minute, so the flavours explode in your mouth.

The fennel has to be halved, sliced and finely chopped; the asparagus needs to have the woody ends removed, the stalks finely sliced and the tips left whole; the cauliflowers need to be divided into small florets; the courgettes need to be quartered lengthways and finely chopped, and finally the tomatoes need to be blanched, cut in half, seeds removed and finely sliced. Now you’re ready to rock and roll., Drizzle 5 tablespoons of olive oil into a casserole pan and place on a medium heat., Peel and finely slice the garlic, trim and finely chop the spring onions  and add both to the pan with the fennel. Gently fry for 15 minutes without colouring., Trim and finely slice the green beans, pod the peas and broad beans, and break up the pasta, then add to the pan with the rest of the prepared vegetables and the boiling stock., Bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes while you pick and finely chop the basil leaves and chives., Season the soup with sea salt and black pepper, and serve in big bowls with a dollop of fresh pesto in the middle, a sprinkling of chopped basil and chives, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

then drain. When cool, pinch their skins off – they’ll taste less bitter if you do this. Now whiz the coriander and half the mint in a food processor., Season with sea salt and black pepper, then add the spices, chilli, broad beans and lemon zest and whiz until finely chopped (stopping once or twice to scrape the mixture off the sides). Sprinkle in the flour and pulse for a few seconds. Don’t add any more flour or the mixture will become too dry., Get a large saucepan and pour in the vegetable oil till it’s 5 to 7cm deep. Be careful – keep kids and pets away, and make sure the handle isn’t sticking out so you don’t accidentally catch it and spill the hot oil., Heat the oil. To check whether it’s hot enough for frying, drop in the piece of potato – as soon as it sizzles and floats to the top, you’re in business. Remove the potato and discard it., Cover a plate with a sheet of greaseproof paper. Scoop up a small amount of the broad bean mixture and either use your hands or two spoons to shape it into little rounds, then put them on to the plate., When they’re all done, carefully lower one of them into the hot oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper. When you’ve got the hang of it, fry the rest of them – they should all fit into the pan at the same time but, if not, simply do batches., For your lemon minted yoghurt, squeeze half the lemon juice into the yoghurt. Pick and chop the rest of your mint leaves and stir them in, adding salt and pepper to taste. Dress your salad leaves with a squeeze of lemon juice and some olive oil., Sprinkle the fritters with salt and serve with the lemon minted yoghurt, the dressed salad leaves and some pickled chillies."

Slice and dice it all up into 1cm/½ inch-ish cubes. Don't get your ruler out – they don't have to be perfect., Put a casserole-type pot on a high heat, add 3 good lugs of olive oil, then add the celeriac. Pick in the thyme leaves and peel and finely chop the garlic, and add both with a little sea salt and black pepper. Stir around to coat and fry quite fast, giving a little colour, for 5 minutes., Turn the heat down to a simmer, add the water or stock, place a lid on top and cook for around 25 minutes, until tender., Season carefully to taste and stir around with a spoon to smash up the celeriac. Some people like to keep it in cubes, some like to mash it, but I think it looks and tastes much better if you smash it, which is somewhere in the middle. You can serve this with just about any meat you can think of."

Take an earthenware dish that the tomatoes will fit snugly into, and sprinkle the garlic and basil all over the bottom of it. Stand the tomatoes next to each other in the tray, on top of the garlic and basil, then push the bay leaves well into the scores in the tomatoes and season well. Lay the leeks on a board and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Using a rolling pin, press down on top of the leeks to really squeeze the seasoning into them. This will also loosen their texture. Weave the leeks in and around the tomatoes. Pour over the balsamic vinegar, drizzle over the olive oil, and bake in the preheated oven for an hour.

It's available in every single supermarket, we walk past it all the time, and yet we still take no notice of it. It's an incredible vegetable, it's really good for you and you only need to use 2 or 3 ingredients to bring it to life and blow people's socks off., Shave off the celeriac ends and throw them away, then use your knife to peel away the outside skin, cutting away any cracks and crannies as you go. Once you've cut the edge you’ll be able to see the thickness of the skin you need to peel away. Chop the celeriac up into slices, then into rough 1cm cubes., Put a casserole-type pan on a medium-high heat and add a lug of olive oil. Rip in the lemon thyme - the smells from this will be outrageous – then go straight in with the diced celeriac and a generous pinch of salt. Turn the heat down to medium, pop the lid on and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender. Make sure you keep it moving - you want it to fry lightly from the bottom, and kind of steam in its own moisture., At this stage, you have two choices. You can either serve it up blonde or you can take the lid off and fry for a further 4 minutes or so, to take the colour much darker. This is such a flexible recipe, you can make it the day before and reheat when you need, or you can blitz it up with some stock for a delicious soup. Give it a try."

First, you have got to get your hungry guests around the table before you plate up, so as soon as their bums are on the chairs, you are tossing the warm ingredients in with the rocket leaves. Boom, boom, boom on a plate and it's in front of them., Peel, halve and quarter 2 medium red onions, then quarter again, to give you 8 pieces from each onion. Heat a frying pan and fry off 8 whole rashers of pancetta or smoked streaky bacon until crisp. Remove, add a couple of lugs of olive oil to the pan, and add 4 sprigs of thyme, the onions and a good handful of pine nuts with a tiny pinch of salt. Toss around and fry on a medium heat for about 5 minutes until caramelized and sweet (not black!)., Put your pancetta or bacon back into the pan, toss around, then throw everything into a salad bowl with 4 big handfuls of rocket or any nice salad leaves. Drizzle generously with balsamic vinegar – this will make a natural dressing as it mixes with the olive oil. Serve with some shaved Parmesan over the top – you can use a potato peeler to do this.

Although called artichokes they’re actually tubers – like rough and ready potatoes. You can scrub and roast them whole like mini jacket potatoes and split them open, drizzled with a little chilli oil. You can even use them in a salad with smoky bacon. A Jerusalem artichoke’s best friends are sage, thyme, butter, bacon, bay, cream, breadcrumbs, cheese and anything smoked., To serve 4, you will need 600g/1lb 6oz of Jerusalem artichokes. Peel them, then cut them into chunks. Place them in an oiled frying pan and fry on a medium heat until golden on both sides, then add a few bay leaves, 2 cloves of garlic, finely sliced, a splash of white wine vinegar, some salt and pepper, and place a lid on top. After about 20 to 25 minutes they will have softened up nicely and you can remove the lid and the bay leaves. Continue cooking for a couple of minutes to crisp the artichoke slices up one last time, then serve straight away. Personally, I think they go well with both meat and fish and are particularly good in a plate of antipasti, or in soups or warm salads."

Halve and deseed the pepper, then cut each half into 4 pieces. Peel the red onion and cut into 8 wedges. Carefully cut the squash in half then scoop out and discard the seeds. Cut each half into 2cm chunks. Wash and trim the baby leeks. Halve the courgettes lengthways then slice into 2cm chunks. Top and tail the aubergine, cut it into quarters, then into 2cm chunks. Quarter the tomatoes. Leave the cloves of garlic in their skins but squash them with the heel of your hand., Put all the veg in an extra large roasting tray, or 2 smaller ones. Crush the coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar then scatter over the veg with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Pick and roughly chop the rosemary leaves. Pick the thyme leaves. Scatter all of the herbs over the veg. Drizzle it all well with olive oil, then toss to coat., To cook and serve your vegetables:

Roast your veg in the hot oven for around 50 minutes, or until soft, golden and cooked through. Serve with anything from roast chicken to grilled meats or fish, or try tossing with pasta or couscous for a simple veggie meal., Jamie's top tips:, If the vegetables seem crowded in a single roasting pan, divide them between two. Overcrowding the pan will stop enough heat getting to the vegetables and they will steam rather than roast., Turning the vegetables as they roast helps them to cook evenly. If you’re using two roasting pans, swap them round half way through cooking.

Roasting is a great way to make veg taste delicious, and it works for just about any combo – just make sure your oven is fairly hot, the veg are roughly the same size and that they get a good stir every now and again., You can also make this ahead of time and eat it cold – it’s just as delicious!"

Even though it’s very Tuscan in style, the flavours remind me of English chutney recipes that I’ve come across in old cookbooks. When roasted like this, the squash is wonderful eaten as part of an antipasti plate, or in soups, or tossed with pasta, or with meat. Other types of squash that are great for roasting are onion squash (which has a dense orange skin) and acorn squash (which has an orangey-grey skin and is a bit more squashed than round). Ask your local fruit and veg man for guidance if you’re not sure.

Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Halve the butternut squash, remove and reserve the seeds, then cut the squash into slices or chunks with the skin left on. Using a pestle and mortar, or a metal bowl with a rolling pin, bash up the dried red chilli with a good pinch of salt. Add the whole sage leaves, the pieces of cinnamon and enough olive oil to loosen the mixture, and rub the whole lot over all the squash pieces so they are well covered., Place the squash in one layer in a roasting tray and season lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle over the seeds, cover tightly with tin foil and bake for 30 minutes, or until the skin of the squash is soft, then remove the foil and cook for another 10 minutes until the squash is golden and crisp. Remove the cinnamon and tuck in!"

Drain them well (if there's too much water in them they won't roast properly) and toss in a bowl with a good lug of olive oil, a splash of red wine vinegar, the chopped thyme leaves and the garlic. Arrange the leeks in one layer in a baking tray or earthenware dish and roast in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes until golden and almost caramelized.

Having the asparagus tied together looks damn funky and all the ingredients flavour each other as they roast in the oven, which makes them taste sensational. I've used string to tie the bundles together in the picture but it's much better to use a slice of pancetta., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7. Remove the stalk ends of the asparagus by bending them and snapping where it clicks naturally. Feel free to boil your asparagus for a minute if they're not as tender as they should be. Grab 6 spears of asparagus, sandwich one of the rosemary sprigs and one of the anchovy fillets among the spears, and wrap a slice of pancetta round the middle to hold everything in place., Make 3 more bundles the same way, and put them into a small roasting tray or pan with ½ a lemon. Drizzle with a little olive oil and roast in the preheated oven for 4 to 5 minutes, until the pancetta is crispy. Remove from the oven and squeeze over the juice of your roasted lemon. Season if need be. This will make a fantastic smoky sauce with your melted anchovies – absolutely scrumptious."

to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Bring two large pans of salted water to the boil., Scrub the beets, then place in one of the pans - keep them separate to stop the rest of your veg turning red! Parboil for 20 to 25 minutes., Meanwhile, peel the carrots and parsnips, then chop any bigger ones in half along with the turnips. Trim and quarter the fennel., Place the prepped veg together in the second pan and parboil for 10 minutes. Drain all the veg and leave to steam dry, then separate them out so you can hit them with those different flavours., Toss the beets with the balsamic vinegar and whole herb sprigs., Toss the carrots with the clementine juice and throw in the squeezed halves, then pick over the rosemary leaves., Toss the parsnips with the vinegar and tear over the sage leaves. Reserve the honey for later., Toss the turnips with the vinegar and bay., Toss the fennel with the lemon juice, then pick over the thyme leaves., Lay them out on a large tray, keeping each veg type together. If you're making this ahead, you can get up to this stage the day before, then cover them with tin foil and keep them with your spuds till your turkey is resting. Nothing will discolour because of the oil and acid., Roast for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until golden, crispy and beautiful. About 5 minutes before the veg are ready, drizzle the honey over the parsnips., Once ready, give the tray a jiggle, then pile the veg on a platter."

Break the garlic bulb into cloves, leaving them unpeeled, and bash them slightly with the palm of your hand. Pick the rosemary leaves., Put the potatoes and carrots into a large pan – you may need to use two – of boiling salted water on a high heat and bring back to the boil. Allow to boil for 5 minutes, then add the parsnips and cook for another 4 minutes., Drain in a colander and allow to steam dry. Take out the carrots and parsnips and put to one side., Fluff up the potatoes in the colander by shaking it around a little – it’s important to ‘chuff them up’ like this if you want them to have all those lovely crispy bits when they’re cooked., Put a large roasting tray over a medium heat and either add a few generous lugs of olive oil or carefully spoon a little of the fat from the meat you’re cooking, and add the garlic and rosemary., Tip the vegetables into the tray, season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper and turn the veg over to coat them in the flavours. Spread them out evenly into one layer – this is important, as you want them to roast, not steam as they will if you have them all on top of each other., Roast for 1 hour, or until golden and crisp, then serve immediately with your roast and some delicious gravy."

toasted","If you’re going to use cooked carrots in a salad you’ve got to make it with some attitude! This fantastic Moroccan-style salad combines roast carrots with avocados – and because they have the same texture in your mouth, I thought I’d add the chargrilled flavour and crunch of toasted ciabatta to round things off. With spices, seeds, yoghurt and a delicious citrus dressing, you’ve got a winner., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Parboil your carrots in boiling, salted water for 10 minutes, until they are very nearly cooked, then drain and put them into a roasting tray. You should flavour them while they’re steaming hot, so while the carrots are cooking get a pestle and mortar and smash up the cumin seeds, chillies, salt and pepper. Add the garlic and thyme leaves and smash up again until you have a kind of paste. The idea here is to build up the flavours. Add enough extra virgin olive oil to generously cover the paste, and a good swig of vinegar. This will be like a marinade, a rub and a dressing all in one! Stir together, then pour over the carrots in the tray, coating them well. Add the orange and lemon halves, cut-side down. These will roast along with the carrots, and their juice can be used as the basis of the dressing. Place in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden.  
While the carrots are roasting, halve and peel your avocados, discarding the stones, then cut them into wedges lengthways and place in a big bowl. Remove the carrots from the oven and add them to the avocados. Carefully, using some tongs, squeeze the roasted orange and lemon juice into a bowl and add the same amount of extra virgin olive oil and a little swig of red wine vinegar. Season, and pour this dressing over the carrots and avocados. Mix together, have a taste and correct the seasoning. Call your gang round the table while you toast or griddle your ciabatta slices., Tear the toasted bread into little pieces and add to the dressed carrot and avocado. Mix together, toss in the salad leaves and cress and transfer to a big platter or divide between individual plates. Spoon over a nice dollop of yoghurt, sprinkle over your toasted seeds and drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil."

If they break every now and again it doesn’t matter. Continue until you reach the fluffy tasteless inner core, which you should throw away. Remove and discard the chunky stalks from the parsley, then finely slice the thinner stalks and roughly chop the leaves., Put your celeriac and parsley into a large bowl and mix together with all the other ingredients. Season to taste, adding a little more vinegar if need be, then serve straight away., Try this: Put some of this salad on a plate, then cover it completely with some smoked salmon and plenty of ground black pepper., Or this: Roast a nice chicken. Allow it to cool and serve with this salad."
Raw beetroot salad | Vegetables recipes | Jamie Oliver recipes,"A light, zingy bite","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/oldImages/large/438_1_1439306998.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '6']",In15 minutes,“This colourful beetroot salad makes a great little snack or starter and is really easy to rustle up ”,18,0.1g,0.0g,3.6g,0.42g,0.09g,3.9g,1.0g,"beetroots, salt, pepper, flat-leaf parsley, fresh horseradish","The other day I had a nice little roast in the oven – comfort food for a great Sunday afternoon. I had a bunch of raw beetroot to use up, so I thought it would be good to have something nice and zingy to munch on while I was waiting for the chicken to cook – like some tapas or antipasti to get my tastebuds going. You can get some great beetroots these days – fantastic colours., I took the leaves off the beetroots and threw them away, as I didn't need them for this salad (although it's worth remembering that they're edible and that they taste nicer than Swiss chard or spinach!). I washed the beetroots and then, using a speed peeler, I peeled them all down into really thin slices and flavoured them with salt, pepper, chopped flat-leaf parsley and a little grated fresh horseradish to give a nice bit of heat. Then I left them for 5 to 10 minutes so that the acid from the horseradish would soften the beetroot. The horseradish is optional, but it gives a good twang., This salad is lovely on a bit of toast, with maybe a splash of vodka or a little block of crumbled feta cheese. Really nice to pick at before you have dinner."

Sometimes in life you have one particular thing which, on its own, is nothing, yet mix it up in the right combination and somehow it becomes genius – it’s like this with recipes, and especially this one., Get yourself a large bowl and, for each person, toss together a handful of rocket with a small handful of grated Parmesan cheese and a quarter of a radicchio, finely sliced. Dress this with a lug of balsamic vinegar, three times as much extra virgin olive oil, and a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix carefully, grate over a little extra Parmesan, and eat straight away. You can vary it by adding things like toasted pine nuts, roasted red onions or crispy bacon."

Cook the potatoes in plenty of boiling salted water for around 20 minutes until tender, and drain well. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, rub off the skins with a knife and slice into bite-size pieces. Mix with the dressing, then add the radishes and herbs and season well to taste."

Roll the pastry to the thickness of a pound coin. Get a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin, line with the pastry and bake blind for 20 minutes. Set aside., Lay the squash in a baking tray. Sprinkle with the nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon and drizzle with the maple syrup. Cover the tray tightly with a double layer of tinfoil and bake for 45 minutes until soft. Reduce the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Allow the pieces of squash to cool, then scoop out the flesh. You should have about 600g of cooked squash flesh. Don't forget to scrape out the bits in the tray and the maple syrup. Put in a food processor and whiz until smooth. Transfer to a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of the sugar and the eggs. Mix well and stir in the cream., Fill the cooled tart case with the mix and bake for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, wash the stringy bits of squash off the seeds, dry them and lay them flat on a tray.

Get your bunch of thyme, tie it up with a little string and add to the pot with the celeriac, potatoes and stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for 40 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Add the cream, bring back to the boil, then remove the thyme and purée the mixture in a liquidizer or food processor. Season carefully to taste, adding the truffle oil tablespoon by tablespoon – the oil can vary in strength depending on the brand. Divide between your serving bowls. Feel free to improvise by adding croûtons, a little extra cream or, if you're really lucky, some real black or white truffles shaved over the top., Try this: If you want to give an edge to this comforting soup, try dressing some chopped parsley and celery leaves with a little olive oil and lemon juice. Sprinkle over the soup at the last minute before serving."

Tip the potatoes into a large tray in one layer, and add the fat – olive oil, butter or goose fat – then season really well with sea salt and black pepper., Toss the potatoes in the fat (you could get the potatoes up to this stage the day before, simply cover them with clingfilm or tin foil and pop in the fridge or in a cool place until needed), then roast for 30 minutes, or until lightly golden and three quarters cooked., Now’s the time for my trick. Gently squash each potato with a potato masher to increase the surface area – the more of your potato that’s in contact with the pan, the crispier it will be., Add 1 good lug of oil to a small bowl and pick and/or tear in the herbs. If opting for flavour combo 2, peel in a good few strips of clementine zest with a speed-peeler – you won’t eat these but they’ll add amazing flavour. Break up the garlic bulb, adding the unpeeled cloves to the bowl, along with a splash of red wine vinegar, then scrunch and mix it up a bit., Add your chosen flavour combo to the potatoes and give the pan a good shake, then pop back in the hot oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until gnarly, crispy, bubbly and delicious., Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain off some of the excess fat, then tuck in!"

If there is any excess moisture when the spinach is cooked, just tilt the pan so it runs to the other side and pour it away. Let the spinach sit for a minute and then serve."

heat to get nice and hot, and pour your stock into a small pan on a low heat to get warm. To make your fragrant soup base, add the lime leaves, chillies, garlic, ginger, lemongrass and a pinch of salt to a food processor. Chop the top few leaves off your bunch of coriander and pop to one side, then add the rest to the processor and blitz for 30 seconds or so until fairly fine. With the processor still running, add a few good lugs of olive oil, the five-spice and ground cumin. Tip this mixture straight into your hot pan, you can add a splash of stock to loosen it if you want, and fry and stir for a couple of minutes so it starts smelling fantastic. Add your sliced onion, then cook gently for 8 to 10 minutes., Add the squash to the pan and stir well, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until the squash is lovely and soft. At this point, add the rice and give it a really good stir. If it looks a bit dry, you can add a splash of water here. Continue to simmer for about 8 minutes until the rice is almost cooked, then add the coconut milk and bring back to the boil. Simmer for a couple of minutes until hot through and thickened a little. I like to squash up some of the squash at this point too., Take the pan off the heat, give it a good stir, then taste and season carefully with salt and pepper. To give it a bit of twang add the lime juice – the amount you need will depend on how juicy your limes are, so keep tasting it as you go. Scatter with more sliced fresh chilli and your reserved coriander leaves before serving., If you’re making this for a party, what I like to do is to hack the top off a massive pumpkin, scoop out the insides, then bake the shell in the oven for 40 minutes at 100ºC/220ºF/gas ¼. You can then use this as a receptacle for your hot soup, and as long as it’s an inch or so thick, it should keep warm for a good hour or so. Have it sitting out at the party with a load of little cups and bowls lined up next to it and a bunch of lime wedges, and let everyone help themselves!"

It’s not like minestrone, as it isn’t brothy and it has no pasta in it. It’s actually more like pappa al pomodoro, as it’s thick and based on bread. It’s very much Italian ‘peasant food’ and would have been eaten a lot in the days of no central heating and lots of hard manual labour. I think this recipe embraces the heart and soul of what peasant cooking is all about – cheap, tasty power food. ”",397,21.8g,3.0g,14.0g,0.95g,12.3g,40.3g,12.3g,"310                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                zolfini or cannellini beans                                                                                                                                                                , fresh, or dried and soaked overnight, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    bay leaf, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ripe tomato, 1                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                potato, 2                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                red onions, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    carrots, 3                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 3                                                                                                                                                                sticks of                                                                                                                                                                celery, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                pinch of                                                                                                                                                                ground fennel seeds, 1                                                                                                                                                                pinch of                                                                                                                                                                dried red chilli, 1 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                good-quality plum tomatoes, 310                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                cavolo nero, 2                                                                                                                                                                large handfuls of                                                                                                                                                                good-quality stale bread, extra virgin olive oil","Add your fresh or dried and soaked beans to a pan of water with the bay leaf – this will help to flavour the beans and soften their skins. Squash the tomato, peel the potato and add both to the pan. Cook until the beans are tender – taste one to check they’re nice and soft. Dried beans can take up to an hour, but check fresh ones after 25 minutes. Drain (reserving about half a glass of the cooking water), and discard the bay leaf, tomato and potato., Peel and finely chop your onions, carrots and garlic. Trim and finely chop the celery., Heat a saucepan with a splash of olive oil and add the vegetables to the pan with the ground fennel seeds and chilli. Sweat very slowly on a low heat with the lid just ajar for around 15 to 20 minutes until soft, but not brown., Add the tomatoes and bring to a gentle simmer for a few minutes., Add the cooked and drained beans with a little of the water they were cooked in, and bring back to the boil., Finely slice the cavolo nero (stalks and all) and add to the pan – it will look like loads, but don’t worry as it will cook down., Tear the bread into chunks, then moisten with a little of the cooking water and stir it in too. The soup should be thick but not dry, so add a little more cooking water if you need to loosen it. Continue cooking for about 30 minutes – you want to achieve a silky, thick soup., Season the ribollita with sea salt and black pepper, and stir in 4 good lugs of good-quality Tuscan extra virgin olive oil before serving to give it a glossy velvety texture., Delicious served on a cold winter’s day with lots and lots of Chianti!"

When I’m doing mine I round up friends and family to get the job done quicker. I also put the larger ones in one bowl and the smaller ones in another – they’ll need different cooking times. Blanch the beans in unsalted boiling water for a couple of minutes, giving the large ones a bit longer (don’t add salt, as this will toughen the skins). Drain them and lay them flat on a tray to cool down slightly. This salad always works best when the beans are eaten slightly warm. If you’re making it in advance, though, you could always give them a quick flash in the microwave just before serving. Remove the skins from the larger beans if necessary. Place in a bowl and dress with the juice of 1 lemon and three times as much extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Add a little more lemon juice if needed – feel free to adjust to your taste. At this stage I like to finely slice half the mint and add it to the beans while they sit and marinate for a little while., In a shallow pan, on a medium heat, fry the chopped onion, cumin seeds and chilli in a little olive oil. Stir and cook until softened. As the onions start to colour, add your breadcrumbs and mix these really well into the onions. Continue to cook until the crumbs are crispy and golden, then season them to taste and put to one side. To serve, divide the yoghurt or soured cream between four plates or bowls. Give the broad beans a final toss, add the rest of the mint leaves, and divide between the plates on top of the yoghurt. Finally, sprinkle over the warm spiced crunchy bits., Sometimes I like to zest a bit of lemon over the top to give a little edge. Fantastic served with grilled chicken or as a tapas or antipasti style thing. Also great with flatbreads like pitta."

Use it to jazz up meat, fish or roasted vegetables, or you could even enjoy it as a lovely dip for roasted new potatoes., Pick and roughly chop the herb leaves in the centre of a large chopping board. Add the garlic, capers, cornichons and anchovies and continue chopping and mixing it all together until fine., Scrape everything into a large bowl and add the mustard, extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar. Have a taste and season with salt and pepper. You might need to tweak the flavours a little, so keep tasting and add more oil, vinegar and seasoning if needed until you get it just right."

Immediately drain in a colander, then place the peas and mint into a salad-type bowl. Sprinkle with a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice or a swig of good-quality red or white wine vinegar. Cover the peas and mint with the olive oil (it’s important to use the best you can get, as the better the quality, the better the dish) and mix around. Put to one side for half an hour, after which the flavours will really have started to develop., There are so many things you can serve these peas with: from grilled fish to bruschetta or crostini, roasted or grilled lamb cutlets or pork, or served next to a hearty roast chicken.

It does a great job of waking up the other things it’s served with – a few spoonfuls of this next to a grilled chicken breast or pork chop would be an absolute celebration., Veg-wise, the onion, coriander and white cabbage are non-negotiable, as they form the base of this salad, but feel free to have a play with the other ingredients and use things like fennel or asparagus. Basically whatever’s in season and available should be a nice addition., The easiest and quickest way to make this is to use a food processor with a slicer attachment or a mandolin. If you don’t have either of those, use a speed peeler, or simply grate everything finely., Shred your white and red cabbage into two separate piles. Put just the white cabbage into a large bowl with the radishes, carrots and most of the coriander. Mix everything together really well, then kick up the flavours by adding almost all the chopped chilli, the sliced red onion and a good few lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Add most of the lime juice and a good pinch of sea salt, then toss together and have a taste. Just keep adjusting everything, adding more fragrance with the coriander, heat with the last of the chilli and acid with another squeeze of lime juice, until it’s just right for you., When you’re happy, fold in the red cabbage right before serving so it doesn’t stain everything, and tuck in."

The great thing about it is that you can use any combination of greens, such as baby cabbage leaves, Swiss chard and even salad leaves like cos, gem or Romaine. You can easily buy a big bag of spinach, rocket and watercress and use some yellow celery leaves and other herbs like basil, parsley, sorrel and fennel tops to give you a good mixture. Most Italians have a vegetable garden, and no matter how big or small it is they always have greens and veggies to hand. This recipe sees the more robust leaves blanched first, then wilted down in a pan with the salad leaves, herbs and garlic until soft and tender., Blanch the cabbage leaves and chard to perfection in a pot of salted boiling water for a couple of minutes, then drain in a colander and leave to cool down a little. Put a couple of good lugs of olive oil into a large frying pan or casserole type dish and add the sliced garlic. As soon as it starts to take on the smallest amount of colour, throw in your salad leaves then the cabbage and Swiss chard., Cook on a medium heat for about 4 to 5 minutes, moving the greens around the pan with a spoon or a pair of tongs, then add your herbs and cook for a further minute. Remove from the heat and season carefully to taste with salt and pepper, some good-quality extra virgin olive oil and enough lemon juice to give it a little kick."

Soak the farro or bulgar wheat in cold water for 20 minutes, then drain., Meanwhile, slice the courgettes crossways into chunky crescents and put into a large roasting tray. Add the remaining vegetables and garlic cloves and toss together with a good splash of olive oil. Season well., Spread the vegetables out in one layer if you can, as they’ll roast better this way – use 2 trays if you have to. Roast in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, removing the trays from the oven and carefully shaking them every now and then, until the vegetables are cooked through and crisp around the edges. Sprinkle the vinegar over the vegetables as soon as they come out of the oven and set aside to cool. When cool, tip on to a large chopping board, add the fresh herbs and chop it all finely., Place the farro or bulgar wheat in a large saucepan, cover with fresh cold water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 20 minutes or until tender, then drain well. Dress the farro or bulgar wheat with a good splash of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice, season with salt and pepper and toss with the chopped vegetables. Scatter the reserved fennel tops over the mix and serve."

Sicilians are proud that it's made with produce from their island. All the different methods of making it are more or less the same – the things that make it stand out and be special are the quality of the aubergines, tomatoes and vinegar. Always try to get hold of nice firm aubergines with very few seeds – have a look down in your local market to see if you can find different colours.  ”",199,14.6g,2.0g,7.2g,,4.1g,9.1g,,"2                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                aubergines, 1                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                red onion, 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch                                                                                                                                                                fresh flat-leaf parsley                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                salted capers, 1                                                                                                                                                                handful of                                                                                                                                                                green olives, 5                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                ripe tomatoes, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                heaped teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                dried oregano, 2-3                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                best-quality herb vinegar, OPTIONAL, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                slivered almonds","Cut the aubergine into large chunks. Peel and finely chop the onion, then peel and finely slice the garlic. Pick and chop the parsley leaves and finely chop the stalks., Rinse, soak and drain the capers and remove the olive stones. Roughly chop the tomatoes. Toast the almonds, if using, under a hot grill or in an oven until light brown., Get yourself a large pan, pour in a couple of lugs of olive oil, and place on the heat. Add your aubergine chunks and oregano, season with a little sea salt and toss around so the aubergine is evenly coated by the oil. Cook on a high heat for around 4 or 5 minutes, giving the pan a shake every now and then. (Depending on the size of your pan you may need to cook the aubergine in batches.), When the aubergines are nice and golden on each side, add the onion, garlic and parsley stalks, and continue cooking for another couple of minutes. Feel free to add a little more oil to the pan if you feel it's getting too dry., Throw in the drained capers and the olives, and drizzle over the herb vinegar. When all the vinegar has evaporated, add the tomatoes and simmer for around 15 minutes or until tender., Taste before serving and season if you need to with salt, black pepper and a little more vinegar. Drizzle with some good olive oil and serve sprinkled with the chopped parsley leaves and the almonds if you like."

Place them in a deep pot and cover them with cold water. Throw in your garlic, herb sprigs, bay leaves, celery stick, potato and tomatoes., Place the beans on the heat and slowly bring to the boil. Cover with a lid and simmer very gently for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on whether you’re using fresh or dried, until soft and cooked nicely. Skim if necessary, topping up with boiling water from the kettle if you need to., When the beans are cooked, drain them in a colander, reserving enough of the cooking water to cover them halfway up when put back in the pot. Remove the garlic, herbs, celery, potato and tomatoes from the beans. Squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins and pinch the skin off the tomatoes., Put the garlic, tomatoes and potato on to a plate, mash them with a fork and stir back into the beans.

garlic, chilli, basil stalks, coriander seeds and cloves. Season with a teaspoon of black pepper and a good pinch of sea salt., Cook gently over a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring every so often. Add all the tomatoes and 350ml of cold water. Bring to the boil and simmer gently until the sauce reduces by half., Add the basil leaves, then whiz the sauce in a food processor or with a hand blender and push it through a sieve twice, to make it smooth and shiny. Put the sauce into a clean pan and add the vinegar and the sugar., Place the sauce on the heat and simmer until it reduces and thickens to the consistency of tomato ketchup. At this point, correct the seasoning to taste., Spoon the ketchup through a sterilized funnel into sterilized bottles, then seal tightly and place in a cool dark place or the fridge until needed – it should keep for six months. Great served with steak and chips."

Hold your chillies, one at a time, with a pair of metal tongs in a gas flame until they’re blackened and blistered all over. If you don’t have a gas hob, pop them under a hot grill instead., Place the chillies in a small bowl, cover with cling film and leave for 15 minutes. This way they will steam in their own heat and the skins will peel off very easily., Peel the chillies, open them up and scrape out all the white seeds.

You can use it with anything from fish to chicken, roast lamb, roast potatoes or bread – delicious!, Add the garlic, chilli, rosemary and anchovies to a food processor and whiz until fairly fine. Dice and add the cold butter, then whiz again until well combined., Get yourself a good-sized piece of greaseproof paper and place the butter into the centre. Fold the paper over and roll it around until you have an even-sized log. Twist up the ends to seal then pop in the fridge or freezer until needed., Wash and drain your cabbage leaves, getting rid of any tough stalks. Add to a large pan of salted boiling water, bring back to the boil then cook on a medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until tender. Drain well in a colander and leave to cool., Carefully squeeze the cabbage leaves to get rid of any excess moisture. Add a slice of your flavoured butter and the balsamic vinegar to a large pan on a high heat. Once the butter has melted, add the leaves and toss around for a couple of minutes until hot through. Serve with a tiny extra knob of melting butter on top."

a salad, so cut your medium tomato into wedges, halve the cherry tomatoes and slice the beef tomato into large rounds. Put all the tomatoes into a large salad bowl. Slice the onion very finely so it’s wafer thin and add to the tomatoes. Scratch a fork down the sides of the cucumber so it leaves deep grooves in the skin, then cut it into thick slices. Deseed your pepper, slice it into rings and add them to the salad along with the cucumber., Roughly chop the dill and most of the mint leaves, reserving the smaller ones for garnish. Add the chopped herbs to the bowl of salad, then squeeze your handful of olives over so they season the vegetables, then drop them in., Add a pinch of sea salt, the vinegar and the extra virgin olive oil. Quickly toss everything together with your hands. The minute all those flavours start working with the veg is when the magic starts to happen. Have a taste, and adjust the flavours if need be., To serve, pop the block of feta right on the top of the salad. Sprinkle the oregano over the top along with the reserved mint leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and take it straight to the table. It’s confident and scruffy with a bit of attitude. Delicious., PS I’ve been known to pop leftover Greek salad into a liquidizer with a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a few ice cubes, then blitz it up to a smooth consistency so it's basically a Greek gazpacho. It’s not a classic thing to do, but it is very delicious, not to mention a great way of using up leftovers!"

endearment. It’s also the name for these sweet little puffy tortillas, which are often made around Easter and other special occasions. Look at the gorditas as a tasty spoon for carrying all kinds of big exciting flavours. Mexicans put all sorts of things, from beans, to meat, to salsa, on them. I’ve gone for quite a delicious and delicate apple salsa here – give it a try., Put the cornmeal and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Mix the baking powder into the hot water and pour this into the well. Using a fork, mix the cornmeal into the liquid, and when it starts to come together use your hands to knead it. Divide the dough into 16 equal squash-ball-sized pieces and dust them lightly with flour. Roll each piece around in your hands, then pat and flatten into a small round roughly the size of the base of a wine glass. Put these on an oiled tray, dust with flour and put aside while you make your salsa., Finely chop your apple, tomatoes and spring onions, and finely slice your chilli. Put them all into a bowl. Pick the leaves from your coriander and put them into a bowl of water until you’re ready to serve. Chop the coriander stalks up nice and finely and add to the bowl with the other salsa ingredients.  Put a large pan on a medium heat and add your pumpkin and sunflower seeds. Toss them around for a few minutes and toast them. Add them to your salsa with the juice of your lime, a good lug of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well, then have a taste and add a little more seasoning, lime juice or chilli if you think it needs more attitude. Put the pan back on a medium heat and add a couple of good lugs of olive oil. Cook as many gorditas as will comfortably fit into the pan for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until they’re golden and puff up a little., Serve the gorditas warm out of the pan with a tablespoon of your beautiful salsa, a little hunk of cheese, a couple of your drained coriander leaves and a few slices of chilli, if you fancy, and with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over."

Boiling the beans fast like this helps them to retain all their nutrients. Meanwhile, put the mustard and vinegar into a jam jar or bowl and, while stirring, add the olive oil to make a good hot French dressing. Season carefully with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, then add the finely chopped shallot, the capers if you're using them and the garlic., Remove one of the beans from the pan to check if it's cooked. If it holds its shape but is also soft to the bite, it's perfect. Drain in a colander. Now, while the beans are steaming hot, this is the perfect moment to dress them – a hot bean will take on more of the wonderful dressing than a cold one. It is best to serve the beans warm, not cold, and certainly not at fridge temperature because the flavours will be muted and boring. Serve the beans in a bowl, sprinkled with chervil if you like – it's a delicate, crunchy herb that goes well with beans. Serve as a salad in its own right, or as an accompaniment to a main meal."

Season the garlic butter well with lots of pepper but just a little salt as the anchovy or bacon will act as a seasoning too., Cut each potato into 8 slices. Coat the slices of each potato with the butter mix then reassemble each potato on a piece of double-thick foil. Cut the anchovies or bacon into strips and put between the slices. Do the same with the thyme sprigs and carefully wrap up the potatoes., Lay the wrapped spuds on the cooler coals at the sides of the barbie for 1–1½ hours, depending on their size, turning every now and then, until tender. If you’ve got a gas barbie, put the potatoes right at the back over a low heat and give them plenty of time to cook. You might even want to give them half an hour’s headstart in the oven first."

You may have difficulty getting hold of it, but if you can find it you’ll be using it all the time – it has an unusual flavour half-way between rice and couscous (this recipe will also work well with both of these). In Italy it was a major food for the ancient Romans, who used it to make bread, porridge and soup before they got hold of wheat. Nowadays it’s used in salads, soups, stews, even pastas. You should be able to buy farro in good Italian delis, and supermarkets have started to stock it in the special selection aisles. Here’s a recipe for one of my fave salads – give it a go., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Soak the farro or bulgar wheat in cold water for 20 minutes, then drain. Slice the courgettes across into chunky half-moons and put them into a large roasting tray. Add the remaining vegetables and the garlic cloves and toss together with a good splash of olive oil. Season with pepper and a tiny pinch of salt. Try to spread the vegetables out in one layer, as they’ll roast better this way (use 2 trays if you have to). Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, removing the trays and carefully shaking them now and then, until the vegetables are cooked through and crisp around the edges. Sprinkle a little vinegar over the vegetables as soon as they come out of the oven and set aside to cool. When cool, tip on to a large chopping board, add the fresh herbs and chop finely., Place the farro or bulgar wheat in a large saucepan, cover with fresh cold water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender, and drain well. Dress with olive oil and the lemon juice, season with salt and pepper, and toss with the roasted herby vegetables. Scatter over the reserved fennel tops and serve."

It’s best to start by chopping the harder, crunchier veggies first, so trim and chop your scallions and slice your cucumber. Slice your basil. Bring it all into the centre of the board, and continue chopping and mixing together., Add the lettuce leaves, and cress or alfalfa to the board. When everything is well chopped, you’ll have a big mound of salad on the board., Make a well in the middle and drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar. Add the mustard and the salt and pepper. Sprinkle with nuts. Mix up so everything gets well coated and serve on the board or in a bowl."

Trim, wash and slice the leeks., Put the butter, 2 lugs of olive oil, the sage leaves (reserving 8 for later) and the crushed garlic into a thick-bottomed, non-stick pan. Stir everything round and add the onions, shallots and leeks. Season with sea salt and black pepper., Place a lid on the pan, leaving it slightly ajar, and cook slowly for 50 minutes, without colouring the vegetables too much. Remove the lid for the last 20 minutes – your onions will become soft and golden. Stir occasionally so that nothing catches on the bottom. Having the patience to cook the onions slowly, slowly, gives you an incredible sweetness and an awesome flavour, so don’t be tempted to speed this bit up., When your onions and leeks are lovely and silky, add the stock. Bring to the boil, turn the heat down and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. You can skim any fat off the surface if you like, but I prefer to leave it because it adds good flavour., Preheat the oven or grill to maximum., Toast your bread on both sides. Correct the seasoning of the soup. When it’s perfect, ladle it into individual heatproof serving bowls and place them on a baking tray., Tear toasted bread over each bowl to fit it like a lid. Feel free to push and dunk the bread into the soup a bit. Grate over some of the Cheddar and drizzle over a little Worcestershire sauce., Dress your reserved sage leaves with some olive oil and place one on top of each slice of bread. Put the baking tray into the preheated oven or under the grill to melt the cheese until bubbling and golden. Keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn’t burn! When the cheese is bubbling, very carefully lift out the tray and carry it to the table. Enjoy."

Place the lid on top and bring to the boil, then remove the lid and simmer for a minute or two while you finely slice a handful of mint leaves. With this reasonably small amount of liquid, the butter and wine should form a fantastically simple sauce. Throw in the mint at the last minute and serve straight away. Don't forget that it only takes a handful of grated Parmesan cheese and some cooked tagliatelle to turn these peas into a wonderful pasta dish. Or you can add them to a risotto, or whiz them up with some chicken stock to make a fine pea soup."

squashed tomato and potato – this will help to flavour the beans and soften their skins. Cook until tender – check by tasting. They must be soft. Dried beans can take up to an hour, but check fresh ones after 25 minutes. Drain (reserving about half a glass of the cooking water), and discard the bay leaf, tomato and potato. Now season with salt, pepper and a splash of oil., While the beans are cooking, make your soffrito. Heat a good splash of olive oil in a saucepan and add the chopped pancetta or bacon, onions, carrots, celery, fennel, garlic and the finely sliced basil stalks. Sweat very slowly on a low heat, with the lid just ajar, for around 15 to 20 minutes until soft, but not brown. Add the tomatoes, courgettes and red wine and simmer gently for 15 minutes., Now add the chard or spinach, stock and beans. Put the dried pasta into a polythene bag, squeeze all the air out and tie the end up. Bash gently with a rolling pin to break the pasta into pieces. Snip the end off the bag and empty the contents into the soup. Stir and continue to simmer until the pasta is cooked., If you think the soup is looking too thick, add a little more stock or some of the reserved cooking water to thin it down a bit. Then taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve sprinkled with the torn-up basil leaves and with some extra virgin olive oil drizzled over the top. Put a block of Parmesan and a grater on the table for everyone to help themselves. Heaven!"

You'll also need a jam jar dressing of your choice., To wash your salad leaves: 
When you get your lettuces home, remove the roots and any not-so-nice outside leaves first, then click or tear off the rest of the leaves and give them a good old wash in cold water. Once they’re clean, give them a spin in a salad spinner or shake them dry in a tea towel., To store your salad leaves: 
If you line a salad crisper drawer in your refrigerator with a couple of clean kitchen towels and lay your leaves on top, covering them with another towel, they’ll keep there happily for 4 days. This way you can simply make up your own mixed salads, dressing the leaves with one of my jam jar dressings., To dress your salad leaves: 
Pour the dressing from a height and gently toss the leaves, using the tips of your fingers, until every single leaf is coated."

Smash up the cumin and mustard seeds, chillies and peppercorns in a pestle and mortar until you have a powder. Put the flour into a mixing bowl and stir in the ground spices and the turmeric., Pour in most of the beer and whisk gently. Check the consistency – you want it to be the thickness of double cream. If it’s too thick, whisk in the rest of the beer. Don’t worry too much about having little lumps in the batter, as they’ll just become nice crunchy bits when you start frying. Season with sea salt and put to one side., Trim the bottom off the stalk and break the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Slice up the stalk into 2cm pieces – this way it will all cook at the same rate. Place the cauliflower pieces in a bowl and dust with a little flour., Pour the oil into a deep saucepan – you want it to be about 10–12cm deep – and heat it to 180°C. If you don’t have a thermometer don't worry, just drop a piece of potato into the oil. When it floats to the surface and starts to sizzle, the oil will be at the right temperature so remove the potato from the pan., Shake any excess flour off the cauliflower. One by one, dip the pieces into the beer batter, then carefully place them in the hot oil, moving them away from you as you do so. Make sure you stand back so you don’t get splashed. It’s best to fry them in batches so you don’t overcrowd the pan (but serve them as soon as each batch is ready)., Each time a batch of cauliflower is nearly ready, add some battered parsley leaves to the pan and fry for 40 seconds (you want to serve them scattered over the fritters). Fry the pieces gently, turning them a couple of times with a slotted spoon., When they’re browned and crisp, lift them out of the oil, allowing any excess to drip back into the pan, and drain on kitchen paper.

Although I have called it ‘Keralan’, it isn't really a true salad from there as you'd never find cress in Kerala!, In Rasa, Das uses a lot of fresh coconut – which really is one of the most incredible flavours for making dishes like curries, or mixed into rice, breads, desserts and salads. You can now buy coconuts from most supermarkets, but if you can't find one, feel free to make this salad without it – it will still be pretty good but it won't have that special edge to it. Only make this when the mangoes are silky smooth and not at all stringy. You should be able to cut through them like butter., First of all you need to crack open the shell of the coconut. I normally do this by placing it on a tea towel on a hard surface and then giving it a wallop with a rolling-pin or a hammer. Once you've cracked it open you can pull it apart (being careful not to spill the milk everywhere!), discarding the hard outer shell. The dark skin on the outside of the coconut's flesh doesn't bother me, especially if I'm grating it. But if you want to remove it, a speed peeler works quite well., Once you've got into your coconut, cut the peppers into quarters, remove the stalks and seeds, then finely slice. Trim your cress directly from its punnet (the easiest way to do this is to take the cress out of the punnet, wash the leafy end and stalks under a tap, then slice the stalk end off and discard it). Trim your spring onions and finely slice them. Cut the mango flesh off the stones and finely slice it (there is a knack to doing this properly – if you look at the shape of the mango, the flat stone always lies the same way, parallel with the flattest sides, so you should be able to slice the flesh off with not too much wastage). Get your pieces of coconut and grate them finely. Put all these ingredients into a large salad bowl., Lime and ginger work together really well in the dressing. Finely grate the ginger and lime zest into a small bowl, then add the lime juice and olive oil. Season to taste, and add more oil as necessary to balance the flavours of your dressing. Limes can be different strengths depending on their juiciness and size., Dress the salad just before serving, saving any extra dressing for another day, and eat straight away. Great just as it is, or with some grilled prawns or satay chicken. Also lovely as a snack inside a wrap or flatbread. So even though the coconut may be a pain to prepare it's well worth it..."

Meanwhile, remove and discard the seeds from the chillies, squeeze the juice from the limes, peel the avocados, remove the stone and chop them and roughly chop the fresh coriander., To make the guacamole, mash or blend the chillies, lime juice, avocado and coriander until creamy but a bit chunky. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, and pour into a serving dish. Brush the tortillas with the oil, season, and then sprinkle with the thyme leaves. Lay them on a baking tray – don't overlap them too much – and bake for 5 minutes until golden brown, then leave them to cool. Break into wedges if you like, and serve the crispy tortillas with the guacamole."

Roughly chop the asparagus stalks., Get a large, deep pan on the heat and pour in a good lug of olive oil. Gently fry the onions, celery and leeks for around 10 minutes, or until soft and sweet, without colouring., Add the chopped asparagus stalks and stock and simmer for 20 minutes with a lid on. Remove from the heat and blitz with a hand-held blender or in a liquidizer. Season the soup bit by bit (this is important) with salt and pepper until just right., Put the soup back on the heat, stir in the asparagus tips, bring back to the boil and simmer for a few more minutes, or until the tips have softened., Just before I’m ready to serve the soup, I get a wide casserole-type pan on the heat with 8 to 10cm of boiling water. Using really fresh eggs, I very quickly crack all 10 into the water. Don’t worry about poaching so many at the same time. They don’t have to look perfect. A couple of minutes and they’ll be done, as you want them to be a bit runny., Toast your ciabatta slices. Using a slotted spoon, remove all the poached eggs to a plate and add a knob of butter to them., To serve, divide the soup between eight warmed bowls and place a piece of toast into each. Put a poached egg on top, cut into it to make it runny, season and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil."

It's great because it's a nice little side dish that will go with things like mozzarella, goat's cheese, cured meats, grilled or barbecued white fish like cod or haddock, even things like chicken or pork. Use courgettes when at their best (nice and firm and not too big)., Slice 4 courgettes lengthways as thin as you can (use a mandolin if you have one). Grill on a red-hot griddle pan, or on the barbecue, until lightly charred on each side. Scatter the slices over a large plate, making sure you don't sit them on top of each other otherwise they'll steam and go a bit limp, and there's nothing worse than limp courgettes, I can tell you. While they're still warmish, sprinkle them with a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper., Deseed a red chilli and chop finely. Finely chop ½ a clove of garlic and sprinkle the chilli and garlic evenly from a height over the courgettes. (Add to your own taste, but just remember that when the chilli and garlic mix with the olive oil and lemon juice the heat and flavours are lessened.), Tear over a handful of fresh mint and drizzle with good extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon. I've even been known to throw in some blanched broad beans or raw peas if I can get any. This salad is always a real treat., P.S. If you find yourself with leftovers, try baking any fish fillets (cod, haddock or bass for example) on top of the courgettes. Lovely with steamed rice and seasoned yoghurt. Very fresh and good for you."

Chop your celery and onion. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Add the celery (not the leaves), onion, and thyme. Stir until the vegetables start to brown., Sprinkle the flour over the veggies and stir for a few more minutes. Pour in the milk, add the potato and bring to a boil, stirring the whole time so the soup doesn’t stick to the pot. Cook until the potatoes are tender, but not mushy – this will take around 10 minutes., Meanwhile, chop the celery leaves, trim the ends off the spring onions and slice them thinly. When the potatoes are tender, stir in the corn, spring onion and celery leaves. Bring the soup back to the boil, then serve., This is delicious with a crusty brown roll or a Parmesan crisp."

Here are some tips on buying and preparing a selection of veg..., In most supermarkets these days you can get fresh baby carrots with their green tops. Leave about an inch of the tops on and just give the carrots a scrub., Do the same with some lovely radishes. You can get some marbled pink and white oval ones now, which are crunchy and peppery. Again, leave the tops on as these make good handles when it comes to dipping., Use nice crunchy lettuces. Sweeter lettuces like cos and romaine are good for dipping – I try to use the inner part, keeping the outer leaves for another salad. I leave the stalk on and then cut the lettuce into quarters, and that way they stay in one piece, but you don't have to do this. The important thing is to get good chunks of vegetables. I like to contrast the sweet lettuces with slightly more bitter ones like radicchio or endive., If you've got some young asparagus that's just come into season, it's really nice eaten raw. Feel free to use your imagination on the veggie side. Little fingers of celery or celeriac are also good. However, you often come across people who use raw cauliflower with dips – I personally would prefer colonic irrigation! I think cauliflower and broccoli are just awful eaten raw, so I wouldn't suggest using them here., Put the yoghurt in a food processor, pick in the mint leaves and whiz up for half a minute or so. Add the peas and the Parmesan, and whiz again – the peas will break down and the yoghurt will become green., Put the dip in a bowl, correcting the seasoning with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice. When you add the lemon juice and peas to the yoghurt, quite often it splits and turns into a kind of cheese, but this is absolutely fine. It depends on the type of yoghurt you use and how acidic your lemon is. Just pour away any excess water. Usually, though, it doesn't split and is more like a purée, but both ways are good., Serve your veggies on a big board or in a big bowl next to the dip.

Don’t use globe ones as they tend to be large and coarse., Slice off the top 2cm of the head of the artichoke, then peel the stem with a knife or speed peeler. Tear off the tough outer leaves until you get to the softer inner green ones. Open them out, then use a teaspoon to scrape out the furry chokes and discard. If you’re doing this ahead, put the artichokes in a bowl of water with a little lemon juice to stop them discolouring., Drizzle the inside of each artichoke with olive oil and season well. Stuff each one with a small lemon wedge, a rolled-up slice of prosciutto and a bay leaf., Wet 4 sheets of baking paper, then scrunch up and wrap 1 around each artichoke. Now tightly wrap each one in foil and place directly on the edge of the hot coals for about an hour, turning, until tender. If you have a gas barbie, put them at the back where the heat’s not so intense and cook for 1 hour., Serve unwrapped and broken up with a generous lug of oil and scattered with mint."

Put the peas back in the pan with some of the reserved water and add a splash of olive oil. Stir around, then sprinkle in the Parmesan cheese and stir again until every single pea is lightly coated in the sweet, delicately melted cheese. You may need to add a bit more water to loosen the peas – you want them to be oozy (almost like a risotto consistency). A small squeeze of lemon juice always lifts the peas and cuts through the cheese, and a sprinkle of white pepper is nice too., This dish is best made quickly at the very last minute as, like a risotto, the moment those peas begin to cool down, things start getting a little claggy and rubbery and you definitely don’t want that."

As they cool down, they’ll cook gently in their own steam. By the time they’re cool enough to handle, you’ll be able to peel the skin off easily., When you’ve got rid of most of the skin, trimmed off the stalks and scooped out the seeds, you’ll be left with a pile of nice tasty peppers and chillies. Finely chop by hand or put in a food processor and whiz up, then put to one side., Peel and roughly chop the onions, then pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves., Drizzle a splash of oil into a pan over a low heat, add the onions, rosemary, bay leaves and cinnamon, then season with a little sea salt and black pepper., Cook very slowly for about 20 minutes, or until the onions become rich, golden and sticky., Add the chopped peppers and chillies, sugar and balsamic to the onions and keep cooking. When the liquid reduces and you’re left with a lovely thick sticky chutney, season well to taste., Remove the cinnamon stick and the bay leaves. Either spoon into sterilised jars and put them in a cool dark place, or keep in the fridge and use right away. In sterilised jars, the chutney should keep for a couple of months."

She inspired me to think of grilling as a really exciting way to prepare vegetables., Wash all your vegetables. Heat the barbecue or a griddle pan, put your whole peppers on it, and get them really black on all sides. While still hot, put them in a bowl, cover with cling film and leave to cool., Slice your courgettes lengthways about 0.5cm thick and do the same with your fennel, reserving the herby tops. Grill the courgette and fennel together on the griddle pan for about a minute on each side or until nicely charred. You don’t want them too black or too raw. Transfer to a clean tea towel in one layer, making sure they don’t sit on top of each other, otherwise they will steam and go soggy., Cut the aubergine across into slices 1cm inch thick. Every now and again you get an aubergine that is really seedy — if this happens, it will be bitter and no good, so throw it away and get yourself another one. Chargrill the aubergine slices, turning them 4 times until nicely marked, then transfer to the tea towel., Boil the baby leeks in salted water until they’re just cooked. Then drain, rub with a little olive oil, and chargrill them quickly until lightly marked., Peel the peppers but don’t hold them under the tap as all the sweet fantastic flavour will go down the drain. Carefully rub off the black skin, then remove the stalk and pips and tear the peppers up into large strips. Now put all the vegetables into a large bowl., Take about a quarter of your basil leaves and bash them in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of seasoning until you have a smooth pulp. Add about 8 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar, to taste. Pour this over the vegetables and toss quickly so that everything gets coated in the lovely basil oil, then throw in the remaining whole basil leaves. Slice the garlic really thinly to give you a delicate flavour and add to the bowl with the fennel tops. Mix everything together, and serve on a large plate at room temperature. Great with any grilled fish or meat, or as part of an antipasti plate with some toasted bruschetta and some fresh buffalo mozzarella."

Roll one edge up over the butter as if you were trying to fold the paper in half, and with your hands shape the butter into a cylinder shape as best you can. Wrap the butter up in the paper, twist the ends so the package looks like a Christmas cracker and place in the fridge to set., Steam the carrots for 10 minutes and, once cooked, toss in a warm bowl with some slices of the thyme, cumin and orange butter."

Parsley, rosemary, thyme, bay – use just one or a mixture. Cut an orange into eighths and add them to the water, along with a few whole garlic cloves in their skins. If you really want to be a little tiger, add a pinch of cumin as well (seeds or ground) – it subtly cuts through with the most wonderful flavour. As soon as the carrots are cooked, drain them, discard the herbs and all but one of the orange pieces, squeeze the garlic out of its skin, chop the remaining orange piece finely and toss with the carrots, some seasoning and a little more butter. The flavour will be incredible., Another idea is to fry the chopped-up orange in a good tablespoon of sugar, so it almost jammifies, and serve this on top of the carrots. These two flavours together are one of the coolest things., Or, roasted carrots with orange, garlic and thyme: just as easy – as soon as you drain the carrots you can throw them into a baking tray with the chopped-up orange and the garlic cloves and roast them at 200°C/400°F/gas 6 for 10 minutes – this will give you a slightly meatier flavour., Or simply mash the carrots up with the orange and garlic, so you have some coarse and some smooth.

Put them into a salad bowl with the coriander leaves and the sesame or poppy seeds., To make the dressing, finely grate the zest of the orange into a bowl. Add the orange juice, the juice of 1½ lemons and about 4 times that amount of extra virgin olive oil., Pound your toasted sesame seeds to a pulp in a pestle and mortar, then add to the dressing. Mix well, then season to taste with salt, pepper and possibly more lemon juice to make it nice and zingy so that you can taste it once you've dressed the salad., Once the salad is dressed, the flavour of the lemon will lessen, so get eating straight away."

Line your muffin tins with paper cases., Whiz the squash in a food processor until finely chopped. Add the sugar, and crack in the eggs. Add a pinch of salt, the flour, baking powder, walnuts, cinnamon and olive oil and whiz together until well beaten. You may need to pause the machine at some point to scrape the mix down the sides with a rubber spatula. Try not to overdo it with the mixing – you want to just combine everything and no more., Fill the paper cases with the cake mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Check to see whether they are cooked properly by sticking a wooden skewer or a knife right into one of the cakes – if it comes out clean, they’re done. If it’s a bit sticky, pop them back into the oven for a little longer. Remove from the oven and leave the cakes to cool on a wire rack., As soon as the muffins are in the oven, make your runny frosted topping. Place most of the clementine zest, all the lemon zest and the lemon juice in a bowl. Add the soured cream, icing sugar and vanilla seeds and mix well. Taste and have a think about it – adjust the amount of lemon juice or icing sugar to balance the sweet and sour. Put into the fridge until your cakes have cooled down, then spoon the topping on to the cakes., Serve on a lovely plate (or on a cake stand if you’re feeling elegant, or on a rustic slab if you’re more of a hunter-gatherer type!), with the rest of the clementine zest sprinkled over. For an interesting flavour and look, a few dried lavender flowers or rose petals are fantastic."

Basically, this is your opportunity to make the broccoli really delicate and more salady-looking, so spend a bit of time doing this. You’ll be left with the stalk, so discard the thick dry base, then cut the remaining stalk in half lengthways and finely slice., Blanch your broccoli florets and sliced stalks really quickly in boiling salted water for 60 seconds, just long enough to soften the broccoli but still leave it with a bit of a bite. Drain it in a colander, then spread it around a clean tea towel to steam dry (this is important because it will help the dressing cling to the broccoli). Once completely dry, transfer to a serving dish., Finely slice the bacon and fry on a medium heat with a small splash of olive oil until crisp and golden, then spoon most of the bacon bits over your broccoli., Any leftover fat in the pan can be used in your salad dressing. Pour it into a mixing bowl, then peel and finely grate in the garlic. Add all the other dressing ingredients, season with sea salt and black pepper, and whisk., Halve, deseed and finely slice the tomatoes and chop the chives, reserving the flowers. Add to your broccoli and bacon bits. Dress it all really well, and check the seasoning. If it needs pimping up, add a splash more vinegar. If you’ve got any chive flowers, sprinkle those over the top and serve straight away. It’s beautiful on its own or served next to any grilled or roasted meat or fish."

Turn the chipolatas over, add the mushrooms to the tray, face up, drizzle with a little oil and season with sea salt and black pepper., Lay the bacon in and around everything and pop the tray back under the grill for another 7 to 8 minutes, or until the chipolatas are cooked through., When the tray of extras is just about perfect, turn the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and pop them down at the bottom of the oven to keep warm,, Give the bubble and squeak one final pat down and use the back of a spoon to make four dents, evenly spaced around the pan. Crack in the eggs – it looks fantastic, isn’t predictable and saves on washing up., Season with a tiny bit of salt and pepper and put in the oven for about 8 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking., To serve, pop the tray of bubble & squeak and eggs in the middle of the table with the tray of extras on the side."

Mash the potato with a fork. Chop half the rocket, then add to the potato with the Gorgonzola. Season with pepper (the Gorgonzola will provide the salt) and mix together. Spoon back into the potato skins., Place the potato skins on a couple of baking trays and bake in the oven for 10 minutes, to warm through and melt the cheese.

Peel and finely chop the onion, and peel and finely slice the garlic., Place a large pan on a medium heat with 2 or 3 lugs of olive oil, add the onion, garlic and dried oregano, then cook for 10 minutes, or until the onion is soft and the garlic has a tiny bit of colour., If you’re using tinned tomatoes, break them up, and if you’re using fresh tomatoes (which will obviously taste sweeter and more delicious, if they’re in season), very quickly prick each one and put them into a big pan of boiling water for 40 seconds. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and put them into a bowl of cold water for 30 seconds, then remove the skins, carefully squeeze out the pips and cut up the flesh., Add the tomato flesh or tinned tomatoes to the onion pan, give the mixture a good stir, then put a lid on and simmer slowly for 15 minutes, or until thickened and reduced., Grill the aubergines on both sides until lightly charred – you'll need to work in batches., Season the tomato sauce carefully with sea salt, black pepper and a tiny swig of wine vinegar, then pick in the basil. You can leave the sauce chunky or you can purée it., Spoon a layer of tomato sauce into a 15cm x 25cm baking dish, then add a fine scattering of Parmesan, followed by a single layer of aubergines. Repeat these layers until you’ve used all the ingredients up, finishing with a little sauce and another good sprinkling of Parmesan., Pick and finely chop the oregano, then toss with the breadcrumbs and a little olive oil, then sprinkle on top of the Parmesan. Tear over the mozzarella (if using)., Bake at 190°C/375°F/gas 5 for 30 minutes, or until golden, crisp and bubbly – it’s best eaten straight away, but it can also be served cold."

      mustard seeds","Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Scrub and prick the potatoes and sweet potatoes, then bake until soft, either in the coals of a barbecue wrapped in tin foil, or in the oven for 1 hour, or until cooked through., Once cooked, cut the potatoes open, then scoop out the flesh and roughly mash., Crumble the dried chilli and finely slice the fresh chilli, then peel and finely chop the ginger., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a pan over a medium heat, add the chillies, ginger, mustard seeds, turmeric and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Fry until smelling fantastic and the mustard seeds start to pop, shaking the pan regularly., Meanwhile, trim and finely slice the spring onions, and pick and roughly chop the coriander leaves., Pour the spice mixture over the potatoes then gently mix together with a knife. Taste and season, if needed. Squeeze in the lime juice, add the spring onions and coriander, then mix together., For the dosa batter, add the flours to a large bowl with the bicarb, mustard seeds and a good pinch of salt. Gradually whisk in enough water, about 400ml, to make a loose batter., Drizzle 1 teaspoon of oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat, then wipe around and away with a ball of kitchen paper., Add a spoonful of batter to the pan and immediately twist so the batter coats the base and slips up the edges. As soon as the moisture on top starts to cook away and there are lots of bubbles, add a few heaped teaspoons of potato filling and gently spread across the dosa., Once the base is crispy, loosely roll up the dosa in the pan and you’re ready to go. Delicious served with minted yoghurt, chutney and wedges of lime for squeezing over."

Each part of the family had its own living-room and kitchen. I went back home with them one day and four different families were cooking four different meals – it was very surreal. This pea soup was one of the dishes being made. And it's so simple – just four ingredients and 15 minutes simmering is all it takes. ”",347,9.6g,2g,9.1g,3.1g,11.6g,58.1g,5.6g,"2                                                                                                                                                                medium                                                                                                                                                                onions, olive oil, 4                                                                                                                                                                large handfuls of                                                                                                                                                                freshly podded peas, 1.1                                                                                                                                                                litres                                                                                                                                                                organic chicken stock, 255                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried spaghetti, 1                                                                                                                                                                sprig of                                                                                                                                                                fresh mint                                                                                                                                                                , optional, 1                                                                                                                                                                sprig of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil                                                                                                                                                                , optional, 1                                                                                                                                                                sprig of                                                                                                                                                                fresh rosemary                                                                                                                                                                , optional, extra virgin olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                small handful of                                                                                                                                                                fresh flat-leaf parsley","Peel and finely chop the onions. Pour a good lug of olive oil into a pan, add the onions and fry slowly for 10 minutes., Stir in the peas and chicken stock, bring to the boil and simmer for another 10 minutes or so., Break the spaghetti into 2.5cm lengths. Bring some salted water to the boil and cook your spaghetti for half the time it says on the packet, then drain and add it to the pea soup to finish cooking., It's nice to tie up the sprigs of herbs and pop them into the soup to give it a lovely fragrance, removing them before serving., When the pasta is cooked, have a taste of the soup and season carefully with sea salt and black pepper., Chop the parsley and divide the soup between the bowls. Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with the parsley."

Cover with the lid and allow to heat up like an outdoor oven – you want a temperature of around 175°C/345°F., Scrub the sweet potatoes clean, then rub all over with a drizzle of oil and a good pinch of sea salt. Place on the middle of the barbecue, cover with the lid and bake for around 1 hour, or until soft in the middle and crisp on the outside., Meanwhile, fry the bacon (if using) in a pan over a high heat (you can do this on the hob), or until golden and crisp, then set aside for later., Split the potatoes open, crumble in the bacon (if using) and grate over the cheese. Return to the indirect heat on the barbecue for a further 5 to 10 minutes with the lid on, or until the cheese has melted., Trim and finely slice the spring onions and chilli then sprinkle over the potatoes, serve with spoonfuls of soured cream and devour."

Peel the garlic, then finely slice with the chillies, ideally 1mm thick on a mandolin (use the guard!)., Pour 2 tablespoons of oil into a large wide pan on a medium heat and add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and curry leaves for 1 minute, then the garlic and chillies., Stir so everything’s flat, moving regularly until crisp and lightly golden. With a slotted spoon, remove half the temper to a plate, taking the pan off the heat., Peel the onions and ginger and finely chop with the coriander stalks, then chop the squash into 2cm cubes, leaving the skin on but discarding any seeds. Stir it all into the pan and return to a medium heat for 15 minutes to soften., Stir in the lentils, then 1.5 litres of boiling water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer and cover for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally., Mash the squash into the daal, taste and season to perfection. Remove 6 portions, bag them up and, once completely cool, freeze for a rainy day when you’ll be really grateful it’s there, leaving the rest on a low heat to keep warm., Blitz the coriander leaves, yoghurt, a pinch of sea salt and half the lime juice in a blender until smooth, then decant into a small bowl., Reheat the reserved temper in a non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat with 1 teaspoon of oil, then divide into two piles and crack an egg over each. Cover and leave to slowly fry on the bottom for 2 or 3 minutes, while they coddle on top., One-by-one, puff up your dry poppadoms in the microwave for around 30 seconds each., Top each portion of daal with a fried egg, and pop some spinach, dressing, poppadoms and a lime wedge on the side."

Squeeze the lime juice into a food processor and blitz with all of the other chutney ingredients (removing the chilli stalk) until smooth, adding a little water to loosen if needs be., Pour the chutney into a small bowl and chill in the fridge while you make your fritters., Place the gram flour, spices and mango powder in a large bowl and whisk in 150ml to 180ml of cold water until it forms a thin batter., Cut the aubergines into 3mm rounds., In a deep saucepan, pour in sunflower oil to a depth of at least 2.5cm and bring it to 180ºC over a medium heat – test this with a thermometer, or drop in a cube of bread and when it bubbles immediately the oil is ready., Using metal tongs, dip each aubergine slice in the batter, shake off the excess, then slide it into the hot oil. Do this in batches and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp., Carefully remove from the oil and leave to drain on kitchen paper, seasoning with sea salt while still hot., Drop the curry leaves into the oil and fry for 30 seconds, or until crisp (be careful as the oil will spit)., Serve the fritters with the crispy curry leaves on top, a squeeze of fresh lime, and the coriander chutney on the side."

and slice the onions and garlic, peel and finely grate the ginger., Put all this into a large high-sided roasting tray with the curry paste and a lug of groundnut oil. Toss together until well coated, then roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until sticky and caramelized., Remove half the roasted veg to a large pan to start your daal and return the tray to the oven to keep warm – turn the oven off so that the veg don’t dry out., Place the pan on a low heat on the hob. Stir in the split peas, crumble in the stock cube and add 2 litres of boiling water., Simmer for around 1 hour 20 minutes with the lid on, or until the split peas are tender and the daal has thickened, stirring occasionally, and adding splashes of water to loosen, if needed., Meanwhile, place the flour in a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt and make a well in the middle. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 150ml of water to the well and mix together with a fork., When it comes together as dough, tip it on to a flour-dusted surface, knead until smooth, then divide into 12 balls. Roll each one into a circle, nice and thin, turning as you go and dusting with a little extra flour, if needed., Put a frying pan on a medium heat and cook the chapatis for 1 minute on each side, or until cooked but not coloured. Stack them in tin foil as you go and keep them warm until needed., Put 1 mug of rice and 2 mugs of boiling water into a pan with a pinch of salt. Cook on a medium heat with the lid on for 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed., Meanwhile, to make the flavoured oil (called a temper), finely slice the chilli and place it in a small frying pan on a medium heat with the curry leaves, mustard seeds and a good lug of groundnut oil for 1 to 2 minutes, or until crispy., Load up your warm chapatis with rice, daal and a scattering of roasted veggies, drizzle over the temper, roll up and tuck in."
