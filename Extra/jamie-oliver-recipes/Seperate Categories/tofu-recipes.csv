Singapore-Style Chilli Tofu | Jamie Oliver recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/134979959.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",In50 minutes,"“This recipe was inspired by the stunning dish Singapore-style chilli prawns, which is itself a version of the famous Singapore chilli crab. Tofu can sometimes get a bad rap, but it makes a fantastic alternative to prawns, especially midweek. It has a relatively long shelf-life, so is great to have on hand in the fridge. Frying it until crispy gives it great texture, and it absorbs all the flavours of the sauce – and this dish is ALL about the sauce. It even converted my tofu-fearing husband. ”",,,,,,,,,"40

Trim the lettuce, click apart the leaves and place a few in each bowl., Pop the eggs on top, pick over the herbs, and sprinkle with the nuts.

tablespoons should come out – it’s messy, but really important to do this for great burger texture later)., Place the tofu in a bowl, scraping it off the tea towel. Crack in the egg, then add the breadcrumbs and Marmite. Mix and scrunch together really well with clean hands, then shape into 4 even-sized patties that’ll fit nicely in your buns once cooked., Roughly chop the tomatoes and put into a dry non-stick frying pan on a high heat with a pinch of black pepper, a splash of water and the vinegar., Squash the tomatoes with a potato masher, cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until thick and delicious, then tear in the basil leaves and season to perfection (I sometimes add a pinch of dried red chilli flakes too, for a kick)., If you want to plump up your buns, pop them into a warm oven for a few minutes., Meanwhile, finely slice or prep all the salad veg., Next, pick the basil leaves into a blender and blitz with all the other dressing ingredients and a pinch of salt and pepper until super-smooth., Place 2 teaspoons of oil in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Pick the rosemary leaves into the pan in four piles, place the patties on top and cook for 3 minutes on each side, or until golden., Slice or grate the cheese, place on the patties, reduce the heat to low, then cover and leave to melt for 3 to 4 minutes., Spread the tomato sauce into the buns, then sandwich the cheesy burgers and sliced gherkins inside., Toss the salad with half the dressing (save the rest for another day), serve alongside the burgers and enjoy – totally awesome."

Drain and pat dry with kitchen paper to get rid of any excess moisture, then season with a good pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper., Heat 1cm of groundnut oil in a large wok over a medium heat. Drop a small piece of tofu into the hot oil – if it sizzles and turns golden, it’s ready to go. Add the tofu in batches and fry for 5 to 8 minutes, or until golden, turning regularly., Meanwhile, toast the cashew nuts in a dry frying pan for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden. Tip into a pestle and mortar and crush lightly. Peel the garlic and deseed the chillies, then finely slice. Slice the pak choy lengthways into quarters, then halve each piece lengthways again. Trim and slice the spring onions into 2cm pieces., Once golden, use a slotted spoon to remove the tofu to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain. Carefully remove and discard most of the oil, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pan, then return to a medium-high heat. Add the garlic and chilli and fry for 1 minute, or until lightly golden, then add the pak choy and spring onions. Fry for a further 3 to 4 minutes, or until softened slightly.

Bash with a pinch of salt to a rough paste. Peel, finely chop and add the ginger, then bash until broken down and combined., Finely slice the mushrooms and bamboo shoots. Heat a lug of oil in a large wok or heavy-based saucepan over a medium-high heat, add the mushrooms and fry for 4 minutes, or until lightly golden. Stir in the chilli paste and bamboo shoots and fry for a further minute., Meanwhile, mix together 3 tablespoons of soy, 4 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar, the honey and a good pinch of white pepper. Stir the mixture into the pan and cook for a minute, then pour in the hot stock and bring gently to the boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Meanwhile, chop the tofu into 1cm cubes, finely slice the spring onions and chives and whisk the egg well., Once reduced, remove the soup from the heat. Using a chopstick, stir the soup in a clockwise direction until you get a little whirlpool, then slowly add the beaten egg, stirring continuously to form thin ribbons. Stir in the tofu and return to the heat for 1 minute to warm through. Season to taste with soy and vinegar, then serve immediately with the spring onions and chives scattered on top."

Coarsely grate the palm sugar into a bowl, add the tamarind paste, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, a dash of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of boiling water and mix well so the sugar dissolves. Taste, and adjust the flavours if needed – you’re looking for sweet, sour and slightly salty., Halve, deseed and finely slice the chillies, then place in a bowl with the juice from 1 lime to make a quick pickle., Drain the noodles and toss in a little oil., Peel and roughly chop the shallots, then trim and finely slice the chives. Pick and roughly chop most of the basil and mint leaves., Slice the tofu into rough 1cm chunks. Run the tip of a knife down the back of each prawn and pull out the vein, meaning they’ll butterfly as they cook. Rinse the dried shrimps under cold running water, then pat dry with kitchen paper., Place a large wok on a medium heat with a splash of oil, then add the dried shrimps, peanuts and chilli flakes. Toss for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden., Take the pan off the heat, transfer half the mixture to a pestle and mortar and lightly crush, keeping to one side. Return the pan to a medium-high heat with another splash of oil, adding the shallots to the mix. Fry for 2 minutes, or until turning golden., Toss in the prawns, chives, chopped herbs and shredded radish, then cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes, or until the prawns are almost cooked through., Beat and add the egg, cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then fold through and toss in the tofu, noodles, beansprouts and tamarind sauce until well combined., Divide the pad Thai between bowls, sprinkle over the crushed nut mixture from the mortar and pick over the remaining mint and basil leaves. Serve with the quick pickled chillies and lime wedges for squeezing over. Delicious!"

Gado-gado means medley or potpourri, which refers to all the different seasonal veggies and ingredients that are used, making it slightly different wherever you go and whatever the time of year. Tossed with the most incredible peanut dressing, which to be honest is more of a substantial sauce, and served with something crunchy on the side, such as prawn crackers, it’s a winning combination.

Scrub the potatoes and cook in boiling salted water for around 15 minutes, or until tender, then halve or slice up., Soft-boil the eggs for 6 minutes, or longer if you prefer them more cooked., Cut the tofu into 2½cm chunks and fry in a splash of sesame oil for around 15 minutes, or until golden, then sprinkle lightly with sea salt., Finely shred the cabbage if you want it raw or, if you’d rather cook it (which is traditional), cut it into 2cm slices, place in a colander and slowly pour a kettle of boiling water over the top. For me, this is the perfect amount of heat to soften the cabbage, but means you keep much of the delicious nutrients in there – feel free to apply this to any other seasonal greens you can find, too., Cut the tomatoes into wedges, quarter the radishes and slice the cucumber (I use my crinkle-cut knife – you should get one!). Season everything from a height with a little salt., Next, put all the sauce ingredients into a blender, peeling the garlic and grating in the palm sugar (if needed), then blitz until smooth. Have a taste and adjust the seasoning, making sure the acidity of the lime sings through, so tweak with more, if needed., Traditionally, you’d take a little bit of everything, put it into a bowl and pour the sauce over the top, which is a fine way to serve it. I like to do the reverse, because I feel that once you pour the sauce over you can’t see the care and attention that has gone into the preparation of the ingredients. So I spoon the sauce between four bowls, spread it up around the sides, then divide the ingredients around the bowls, taking a bit of pride in making them look nice., Pick over a few coriander leaves, add the prawn crackers and some finely sliced fresh chilli (if using), then show everyone what a celebration of food this is by getting them to toss together their very own portion."

Transfer to a food processor, along with the chestnut purée, suet and maple syrup, and blitz until it comes together into a ball. It will be sticky to begin with, so stop and scrape the sides as you go., Place a large sheet of greaseproof paper on a work surface and sit the dough on it. Then, with lots of gluten-free flour on your hands and rolling pin, roll out the dough as thinly as possible (less than 5mm)., If you’re making individual tartlets, oil and flour four 10cm loose-bottomed tart tins, then cut the pastry to size. For 1 large tart, roll out the dough and cut to the size of a large, shallow baking tin, and transfer to the tin using a fish slice., Prick the pastry all over with a fork, cover with greaseproof paper, fill with baking beans or rice and bake blind for 12 to 15 minutes. Leave to cool in the tray, and keep the oven on., Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms. Heat 1 tablespoon of rapeseed oil in a pan over a medium heat, then sauté the mushrooms for 6 to 8 minutes, until golden. Remove and set aside., In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of rapeseed oil and wilt the spinach (or heat through if frozen) along with the pepper. Blitz the spinach, avocado flesh, tofu, nutmeg and lemon juice in a food processor until smooth., Thinly slice the sweet potato using a vegetable peeler or mandolin, creating a pile of peelings. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a small pan, then fry the peelings over a high heat, turning occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes, until just turning crisp., Assemble the tart by spreading the spinach mixture over the baked and cooled tart base. Lay the mushrooms on top, and decorate with the sweet potato slivers and a scattering of toasted pine nuts. Eat at room temperature, or heat it up, if you like."
