Sarit & Itamar's mushroom sfiha | Jamie Oliver recipes,With caramelised onions & ricotta,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/153135556.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In35 minutes,,,,,,,,,,"3 onions, 500g mushrooms, 2 tablespoons Baharat seasoning, 1 large flatbread, 250g ricotta, PANTRY, olive oil, black pepper, sea salt, extra virgin olive oil","Peel and dice the onions, then sauté in a pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt on a medium heat so they soften – about 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, thickly slice the mushrooms., Once the onions start to stick to the bottom of the pan, add the sliced mushrooms – they will start to let out water and after about 10 to 12 minutes the volume should halve and there should be no liquid left in the pan., Add the baharat, then taste and adjust seasoning, if needed., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Line a 20cm cake or pie tin (or adjust to the size of your flatbread) with greaseproof paper., Quickly run the flatbread under a lightly running warm tap, drizzle lightly with oil, then press it down into the tin, so that the edges overhang the sides., Fill the base with ricotta, keeping 4 teaspoons back to serve, and spread out to create an even layer., Top with the mushroom filling, fold the overhanging sides of the flatbread down onto the filling and brush the exposed bread with a little olive oil., Bake in the centre of the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, then allow to sit for 5 minutes in the tin, before using the greaseproof to help you remove it easily., Slice up and serve hot with a dollop of seasoned ricotta. Great with a green salad."
Mushroom quesadillas | Jamie Oliver Cookbook Club recipes,My team’s pick of the chapter!,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/152742342.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",MINUTES COOK),"“Quesadillas are like the pizza of Mexico. You can pretty much make them with anything and they’ll be delicious, so long as they’re hot, crispy and oozing with cheese. These meat-less quesadillas are quick to make and fabulously tasty. It’s amazing what just a sprinkle of chipotle powder brings to the party! If a serious food emergency is leaving you short on time, skip the guacamole and just dunk in sour cream with a squirt of hot sauce. ”",,,,,,,,,"3                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                extra-virgin olive oil                                                                                                                                                                , (45ml), 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                portobello mushrooms                                                                                                                                                                , sliced 8mm thick (or other mushrooms of choice), ½                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                chipotle powder, ¼                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                cooking salt, ¼                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                black pepper, ¾                                                                                                                                                                cup (75g)                                                                                                                                                                colby cheese                                                                                                                                                                , shredded, 2 x 20                                                                                                                                                                cm                                                                                                                                                                flour tortillas, TO SERVE, Sour cream, Pico de Gallo                                                                                                                                                                , (page 224 of RecipeTin Eats: Dinner), Guacamole or Avocado Crema                                                                                                                                                                , (page 220 of RecipeTin Eats: Dinner), Lime wedges",

Boil the kettle., Pour 1 litre of boiling kettle water into a measuring jug and crumble in the stock cube, stirring until dissolved. Once the time’s up on the mushrooms, pour any liquid from the bag into the jug and give it a stir (this will give your stock depth of flavour)., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Peel, finely slice and stir in the garlic for 2 minutes, or until lightly golden. Tip in the mushrooms, dried thyme and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and cook for 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms start to caramelise and any water has evaporated, stirring occasionally, then remove from the heat., Remove the contents of the pan to a board and finely chop half of the mushroom mixture, leaving the other half chunky and set aside., Peel the onions and finely chop with the celery. Return the pan to a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Stir in the onions and celery, then cover and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened., Tear off the leafy part of the parsley and set aside, then finely chop the stalks., Once the veg has softened, stir in the rice to toast for 2 minutes. Stir in the parsley stalks and finely chopped mushroom mix and cook for 1 minute, then pour in a ladle of stock and stir in a figure-of-eight motion until it’s all absorbed, popping the lid on every now and then for a couple of minutes to trap in the heat. Continue to add ladlefuls of stock until the rice is tender but still holding its shape – it should take around 15 minutes., Meanwhile, roughly chop the parsley leaves and pound them in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of salt and pepper until you have a bright green pulp. Muddle in 3 tablespoons of oil, then set aside., Remove the risotto from the heat, coarsely grate in most of the cheese (keeping a small handful aside for later), then stir in the reserved mushroom mixture. Cover the pan and leave to relax for 2 minutes until the risotto is creamy and oozy., Divide between plates, finely grate over the remaining cheese, drizzle over a little parsley oil and serve."

Pour in just enough boiling kettle water to cover, pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up., Peel and finely slice 2 cloves of garlic, then pick and finely chop the leaves from 3 sprigs of fresh rosemary., When the time’s up, remove the tray from the oven and transfer the mushrooms to a plate., Place the roasting tray on the hob over a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, add the garlic and rosemary and cook for 1 minute, then stir in the 2 tablespoons of baby capers and 2 x 400g tins of cherry tomatoes. Cook for 5 minutes, or until slightly thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally., Arrange the mushrooms snugly in the sauce, tear over 80g of halloumi and scatter over 40g of shelled unsalted pistachios, then return to the oven at 200°C/400°F/gas 6 for 15 minutes, or until gnarly at the edges., Fork up the couscous, squeeze over the juice from the zested lemon and toss together, discarding the mint. Season to taste., Serve the mushrooms and sauce on top of the couscous, then pick and tear over the remaining 2 sprigs of fresh mint."

I can only attempt to show you how, the best way that I can. The rest is up to you. Please remember, every oven is different. Cooking times will vary. The ultimate goal? To bake the mushroom slices until they are crispy and chewy at the very same time, replicating that distinct bacony texture we all know and love. Good luck! ”",,,,,,,,,"1                                                                                                                                                                pound                                                                                                                                                                stemmed shiitake mushroom caps                                                                                                                                                                 , (about 2 pounds before trimming), ¾                                                                                                                                                                cup                                                                                                                                                                peanut oil, ½                                                                                                                                                                cup                                                                                                                                                                tamari                                                                                                                                                                 , or soy sauce, ½                                                                                                                                                                cup + ½ teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                nutritional yeast                                                                                                                                                                , plus some for dusting, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                liquid smoke                                                                                                                                                                , plus more to taste","Position racks in the centre and bottom third of the oven and preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper., Rinse the shiitake caps and dry them thoroughly in a salad spinner or pat them dry with a paper towel. Cut the caps into ¼-inch-thick slices (the goal here is to have similar-size pieces so that they cook evenly). Transfer them to a large bowl., In a small bowl, whisk together the peanut oil, tamari, ½ cup of the nutritional yeast, and the liquid smoke. Pour this mixture over the sliced shiitakes. Delicately toss them until all the pieces are coated. Divide the mushrooms evenly onto the baking sheets, arranging them into a single layer., Sprinkle the remaining ½ teaspoon nutritional yeast on top of the shiitakes and coat the tops with a healthy amount of cooking oil spray. (The goal here is to basically oven-fry the shiitakes, so please don’t hold back—this isn’t a low-fat recipe. We are replicating bacon, people.), Place the sheets in the oven, one in the centre, one on the bottom. Bake for 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and toss with a thin spatula. Spread the mushrooms back out evenly and coat them again with a good amount of cooking oil spray, and another dusting of nutritional yeast. Return the trays to the oven, switching racks. Bake until the mushrooms become crispy on the edges, about 15 minutes (less if you think they might burn). Remove from the oven., At this point you could make or break the bacon. And because each oven is different, you have to play with it yourself. What you are trying to do is push the mushrooms to their crispiest point without burning them. As my mother would say, you must “Watch them like a hawk!” Coat the mushrooms once more with some cooking oil spray and return to the oven for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for a few minutes. Taste one. If it is still not crispy, bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. If you are scared to keep pushing it, try only baking a few to see how far you can take them. This way you won’t burn the whole batch., One baking sheet may be done before the other; just remove them at separate times. Some pieces may also be stubborn and take longer than others. It’s okay if a few pieces are chewier than others. Like the recipe implies, making shiitake bacon is an art. It takes practice to perfect this exquisite food."

Coarsely grate them on a box grater with the courgette and mushrooms, then tip everything into a large frying pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened., Tip the cooked vegetables into a bowl and leave to cool. Add the minced beef and pork into the cooled vegetables along with the breadcrumbs. Finely grate in most of the Parmesan cheese and crack in the egg, then season with a little black pepper. With clean hands, squish and squash the mixture together until it’s all nicely combined. Now wash your hands!, With wet hands, take tablespoons of the mixture and shape into 24 little balls. Pop them onto a tray and leave in the fridge to firm up for 10 minutes or so. Wash your hands again., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1 teaspoon of oil. Add the balls into the pan and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown and gnarly all over, turning regularly., Peel and finely chop the remaining garlic cloves. Create a little space in the pan in between the meatballs, add the garlic for 2 minutes, then pour in the passata. Give the pan a gentle shake so the balls are evenly coated in the sauce. Simmer for 30 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce is thick and delicious, stirring occasionally."

Trim, wash, pulse and add the leeks. Saving 2 mushrooms for later, pulse the rest and stir into the pan. Cook it all for 15 minutes, stirring regularly, then season to perfection and turn the heat off., Meanwhile, for the sauce, pour 3 tablespoons of oil into a separate pan on a medium heat. Whisk in the flour for 2 minutes, then gradually whisk in the milk. Simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened, then grate in the cheese and season to perfection., Pour one third of the sauce into a 25cm x 30cm roasting tray. As soon as the filling is cool enough to work with, push both ends of each pasta tube into it to fill, lining them up in the tray as you go.

Return to the pan, cover with a lid and leave to steam until ready to serve., Peel and finely slice the onion and garlic. Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a large frying pan over a medium heat, then add the onion and garlic, and cook for around 5 minutes, or until softened., Tear the mushrooms until they are all roughly the same size. Stir the paprika into the pan, then add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes, or until starting to brown. Finely chop the parsley stalks and slice up the cornichons., Cut the venison into roughly 2cm strips and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Add the meat to the pan and fry for 1 minute until just golden., Add a good splash of gin and very carefully flame (stand well back and watch your eyebrows!). Stir in the butter, a few gratings of lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon juice., Stir in most of the soured cream, reserving a tablespoon, and season to perfection. Simmer for 1  minute until just thickened., Swirl through the remaining soured cream, scatter over the sliced cornichons and parsley, and sprinkle with a pinch of paprika. Serve immediately with the fluffy rice."

mushrooms and onions. Marinate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight., When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to full whack (240ºC/475ºF/ gas 9)., Randomly thread the mushrooms and onions on to a large skewer, then place on a large baking tray and roast for 20 minutes, turning occasionally., Push the veg together so it’s all snug, baste with any juices from the tray, then roast for a further 15 minutes, or until gnarly, drizzling over the pomegranate molasses for the last 3 minutes., Meanwhile, finely slice the radishes and cucumber, ideally on a mandolin (use the guard!), and quarter the tomatoes, toss with a pinch of salt and the vinegar, then leave aside., Tip the jalapeños (juices and all) into a blender, then pick in most of the mint leaves and whiz until fine. Pour back into the jar – this will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks for jazzing up future meals., Warm the flatbreads, spread with tahini, then sprinkle over the pickled veg, remaining mint leaves and dukkah., Carve and scatter over the gnarly veg, dollop over the hung yoghurt, drizzle with jalapeño salsa, then roll up, slice and tuck in."

Make a well in the middle, slowly pour in 200ml of cold water, then mix, pat and bring it together., Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 1 hour., After 30 minutes the mushrooms should feel quite soggy, so squeeze firmly to remove as much salty liquid as you can (the mushrooms should end up weighing around 400g)., Peel the swede, potatoes and onion and slice into small pieces, roughly the same size and thickness as a pound coin., Mix the veg with the mushrooms, then add the rosemary and a few generous pinches of black pepper., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Divide the pastry into 8, then roll out into 20cm rounds on a clean flour-dusted surface. Divide up the filling, then scrunch and pile it to one side of the middle, leaving a 2.5cm gap around the edges., Lightly brush the exposed pastry with beaten egg, fold over and press the edges down, then twist and crimp with your fingers and thumbs to seal., Eggwash, then place on a lined baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes, or until golden. Serve with a watercress and apple salad and a dollop of English mustard."

Roast for 1 hour 30 minutes, then finely slice and season with sea salt and black pepper., Meanwhile, halve, wash and finely slice the leeks, then place in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with the butter. Peel, finely slice and add the garlic and mushrooms, then cook for 15 minutes., Stir in the flour and mustard, followed slowly by the milk, then simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened, stirring regularly, and remove from the heat., Pick, finely chop and stir in the parsley, crumble in the cheese, then season to perfection., Line a 20cm bowl (8cm deep) with clingfilm. Arrange slices of celeriac in and around the bowl until covered. Reserving half the sauce, layer up the rest with the remaining celeriac in the bowl, finishing with celeriac., Pull over the clingfilm, weigh it down with something heavy, and chill overnight with the remaining sauce., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., On greaseproof paper, roll both sheets of pastry out to around 30cm x 35cm. Unwrap the filling parcel and place in the middle of one sheet., Beat the egg and brush around the edge of the pastry and all over the celeriac, then carefully lay the second piece of pastry on top, smoothing around the shape of the filling., Trim the edges to 2.5cm, crimp to seal, then eggwash all over. Very lightly score the pastry (like in the picture), making a small hole in the top., Bake at the bottom of the oven for 2 hours, or until beautifully golden, brushing with more eggwash once or twice, then serve with the warmed-up creamy sauce. Delicious with dressed seasonal steamed greens."

Midnight pan-cooked breakfast | Jamie Oliver brunch recipes,"Crispy bacon, runny eggs & crusty bread","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/90246160.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In30 minutes,"“Me and this dish go back a long way. To the pre-shaving days of being an under-age drinker down the Wagon and Horses in Saffron Walden with a fake ID and all my village mates. Only once in a while of course. But seriously, without trying to sound like a lagered-up geezer, I think everyone’s experienced the need for food around midnight, whether the binge was small or large, otherwise why would kebab shops be so popular in Britain? Anyway, I always used to have three or four friends back to my house for munchies or to stay the night and this dish was devised so we didn’t have too much trouble making it or too much washing up to do. In actual fact, I only had to wipe the non-stick pan clean. It also makes its way from the pan to the plate quite quickly, as patience isn’t a virtue at that time of night with my mates! ”",,,,,,,,,"mushrooms, higher-welfare smoked or unsmoked bacon, ripe tomatoes, higher-welfare sausages, large free-range eggs, olive oil, crusty bread                                                                                                                                                                , preferably sourdough","First of all, get the biggest non-stick pan available, and preheat it on a high heat while you gather your ingredients. Obviously you wouldn’t be organised at this point so it’s a matter of using what you’ve got, but ideally I like to have mushrooms, bacon, tomatoes, sausages and eggs., By the time you have got these together the pan will be hot, so slice your sausages in half lengthways and pat them out flat so they cook quickly. Place in the pan at one side., On the other side of the pan, put a tiny lug of oil and place a pile of mushrooms over it which you can rip up or leave whole., Shake the pan about a bit to coat the mushrooms and season with some sea salt and black pepper. Push to one side, then lay some slices of bacon and halved tomatoes in the pan., Cook for a couple more minutes until the bacon is crisp and golden. Shake the pan and turn the bacon over. Now is the time to put a round of toast into the toaster., At this stage you should respect the rustic and authentic look and shuffle everything about so that it’s all mixed together and add 2 or 3 eggs at different ends of the pan. The whites of the eggs will dribble in and around the sausages, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms., Turn the heat down a little and continue to cook for another minute before placing the pan under the grill and finishing the eggs to your liking., Using a non-stick pan I’ve always found the removal of this dish to the plate extremely easy – it will resemble a frisbee and will slide on to your plate with no trouble at all. Doesn’t that sound appetising? But honestly, it really is a gem."

Peel and slice the garlic. Mix everything together in a bowl, including the chicken. Place in the bag, with all the liquid, making sure you don’t pierce the foil., Close up the final edge, making sure the bag is tightly sealed and secure on all sides, and carefully slide it on to a roasting tray. Place the tray on a high heat on the hob for 1 minute to get the heat going, then bake in the middle of the oven for 25 minutes., Remove from the oven, place the bag on a big plate, take it to the table and carefully break open the foil. Feel free to vary the recipe – things like grated parsnip, smoked bacon and red wine also work well."

leaves, then roughly chop., Place a large casserole pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the chopped vegetables, chilli flakes and bay, and cook for 15 minutes, or until golden and soft, stirring regularly., Remove the porcini from their soaking juices, finely chop and add to the pan. Strain in the porcini soaking liquor.  Add the wine, then turn up the heat and let it bubble away for a minute or two., Add the lentils (juice and all) and tomatoes, along with 1 tin's worth of cold water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour or until thick and delicious., To make the pasta, pile the flour into a large bowl, make a well in the middle and gradually add 200ml of tepid water, mixing with a fork. When it becomes too hard to mix, get in there with your hands and bring it together into a ball of dough. Knead on a flour-dusted surface for 5 minutes or until smooth, then cover with clingfilm and leave to rest until you’re ready to roll it out., To make the white sauce, heat a large, deep frying pan over a medium heat with 4 tablespoons of oil. Add the flour and stir well to coat, then gradually add the almond milk, stirring continuously. Leave to bubble away for 5 minutes or  until thickened., Meanwhile, place a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat.  Tear in the mushrooms and dry-fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until charred and nutty. Peel and finely slice the remaining garlic., Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the mushroom pan, followed by the garlic. Strip in the thyme leaves and cook for a further 2 minutes, them remove from the heat., Place a third of the cooked mushrooms into a liquidiser with the white sauce and blitz until smooth. Have a taste and season to perfection., Cut your pasta dough into 6 pieces. One at a time, flatten each piece of dough by hand and roll it out to 2mm thick using a pasta machine (or a rolling pin), keeping the pieces long. Place on a flour-dusted surface., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Whiz the sourdough in a food processor to coarse breadcrumbs., To assemble, line a 30cm ovenproof frying pan with a large piece of oiled baking paper., Line the base with pasta sheets until completely covered, leaving an overhang around the edge of the pan. Trim the remaining pasta sheets for your layers., Layer up the lentil sauce, followed by the white sauce, a scattering of mushrooms and a couple of pasta sheets. Repeat until all the elements are used up, saving your final layer of white sauce and mushrooms for the topping. Bring up the overhanging pasta and let it fall over the filling until completely covered., Add the remaining sauce and mushrooms, then sprinkle over the breadcrumbs, grate over the cheese and pick over the sage leaves. Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil., Bake in the bottom of the oven for 50 minute to 1 hour until golden and bubbling. Leave to stand for 15 to 20 minutes, then tuck in!

Strip in half the thyme leaves (15g) and cook for 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Put 20g of dried porcini mushrooms in a bowl, cover with boiling kettle water and leave to rehydrate., Tear up or halve any larger mushrooms (350g in total), keeping any smaller, delicate ones whole, then stir into the pan. Drain, roughly chop and add the porcini, reserving the soaking liquor., Simmer 1.2 litres of vegetable stock in a pan on a low heat, adding the reserved soaking liquor, discarding the last gritty bit., Stir 300g of risotto rice into the mushroom pan for 2 minutes, then pour in 125ml of white wine and stir until absorbed., Add a ladleful of stock and wait until it’s been fully absorbed before adding the next. Repeat this, stirring and massaging the starch out for the rice for 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked but still holding its shape and the risotto is oozy., Meanwhile, toast 30g of blanched hazelnuts in a frying pan over a medium heat until golden, then roughly bash in a pestle and mortar., Squeeze the juice from 1 lemon into a small bowl, then mix in 4 tablespoons of natural yoghurt, 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Divide 100g of baby spinach between 4 plates, dot over the dressing, then sprinkle over the hazelnuts., Turn off the heat under the risotto, finely grate in 35g of Parmesan and strip in the remaining thyme leaves (15g), then beat in 20g of unsalted butter and season to taste with salt and pepper., Cover and leave to relax for 2 minutes so it becomes creamy and oozy. Beat again, then serve right away with the salad, finishing it with a fine grating of Parmesan (5g)."

Quarter the mushrooms, then pick and finely chop the parsley leaves., Get all the other ingredients measured out and ready to go, as you want everything to happen within 6 minutes once the steaks hit the pan – read to the end of the next paragraph before you start cooking so you know what’s coming., Place a large frying pan on a high heat to get screaming hot. Brush the herbs off the steaks, then place the steaks in the pan with a drizzle of olive oil and the butter., Cook for 6 minutes in total, turning regularly and keeping them moving in the pan, making sure to sear the edges and baste with the juices, as you go., Within this time, as soon as the butter turns dark golden and the steak has good colour and character, add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt and pepper, jiggling the pan to keep things moving., Pour in the brandy, then carefully tilt the pan to catch the flame (or light with a long match) and let it flambé – stand back! When the flames subside, add the red wine and reduce by half (if you need to put the flame out, swiftly place a large metal lid over the pan)., Drizzle in the cream, turning the steaks in the sauce until they are nicely coated (briefly remove the steaks from the pan at this stage if your sauce is taking a while to reduce, to avoid overcooking)., Sprinkle over the parsley, then stir through the mustards. Slice the steaks in half, place on a warmed plate and drizzle with the sauce, then scatter over the dressed pepper sprinkle and tuck in. Delicious served with shoestring fries."

cloves of garlic. Cut the green part off the leeks (save for making stock or soup), then trim, wash and finely chop the white part. Peel the potatoes and chop into ½cm dice. Tie the thyme sprigs together., Melt half the butter in a large pan on a low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, then add the onions, garlic, celery, leeks, potatoes, bay leaves and thyme. Cover and sweat down for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Add all the mince to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Turn the heat up to medium-high and cook for 10 more minutes, or until the mince is browned all over, stirring occasionally., Pour in the wine, let it bubble and boil away, then finely grate in half the nutmeg. Stir in the flour for 1 minute, then pour in the milk. Season with sea salt and black pepper, cover with a scrunched-up sheet of wet greaseproof paper and transfer to the oven for 2 hours, or until thickened and beautifully tender., At this stage, the ragù might look like it’s split a little, but this is actually what we’re looking for – the milk in the sauce creates amazing ricotta-like curds as it cooks., Meanwhile, place a large heatproof baking dish on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil and the remaining butter. Peel, finely chop and add the remaining garlic, along with the chilli flakes, nettles (leaves only – wear gloves to protect your hands while you prep) and spinach – you’ll need to work in batches. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened., Allow to cool, then finely chop and return to the dish, spreading evenly over the base. Once done, divide the ragù in two, freezing one half for another day, once cool., Carefully drain the liquid from the remaining ragù into a bowl through a coarse sieve. Return the ragù to the pan, fish out and discard the thyme stalks and bay, then grate in half the cheese and stir well., Turn the oven up to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Use a piping bag or teaspoon to stuff the cannelloni tubes with the ragù, then arrange on top of the greens. Pour the sieved liquid over the top and grate over the remaining cheese. Trim and finely slice the mushrooms and scatter over the cannelloni., Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, then bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. For added colour, flash the dish under the grill for 5 minutes. Importantly, let it stand for 30 minutes before serving. Delicious with a seasonal salad for added crunch."

Cover the porcini with 300ml of boiling water and leave to rehydrate for 5 minutes., Peel and finely chop 2 of the garlic cloves, then place in a large frying pan on a high heat with a knob of the butter. Add the porcini and half the soaking liquor, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes, or until thick and syrupy., Squeeze in the lemon juice, stir in the remaining butter, and season to taste with sea salt and black pepper. Leave to cool slightly., Drizzle the beef with 1 tablespoon of oil and season with black pepper. Sear in a sturdy roasting tray over a medium heat on the hob until browned all over, then remove from the heat., Lay out the slices of prosciutto on a large piece of greaseproof paper, overlapping them slightly, making a sheet big enough to wrap around the fillet., Spread the mushroom mixture lengthways over one half of the prosciutto, then sit the beef on top. Carefully roll up, tuck in the ends, then discard the paper. Secure with butcher’s string., Squash the remaining unpeeled garlic cloves and put into the roasting tray with the herbs, then carefully place the beef on top. Cook in the oven for 25 minutes for rare, 30 to 35 minutes for medium, or 40 minutes for well done., When the time’s up, remove the meat to a board to rest for 5 minutes, pouring any juices back into the tray., Transfer the tray to a medium-high heat on the hob, pour in the wine and the remaining porcini soaking liquor (discarding just the last gritty bit) and simmer to your desired consistency, scraping up all the goodness from the bottom of the tray., Remove from the heat, and sieve before serving, if you like – I also like to whisk in an extra knob of butter for maximum silkiness., Carve up the beef and serve drizzled with the red wine sauce – delicious with celeriac and potato mash, and steamed greens."

The pasta will seem very thin at this stage, but don't worry it will puff up as it cooks., Peel the garlic and put the whole cloves into a large pan of boiling salted water for 2 minutes (this will make the garlic creamy), then scoop out and finely chop, leaving the water on the heat., Clean and quarter the mushrooms, then very finely slice the truffle. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil into a cold pan, place on a medium heat, then add the garlic, strip in the thyme leaves and scatter in most of the truffle and the porcini., Toss occasionally over the heat while you carefully add the pasta to the boiling water to cook for 4½ minutes (if you’ve left the pasta to dry out, it will take a little longer)., Add the anchovies to the porcini pan – they’ll melt in – and toss together, then add a little pasta water to emulsify into a lovely mushroom sauce. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter., Using tongs, drag the pasta straight into the porcini pan, taking a little cooking water with it.

Tip the mushrooms into a bowl and set aside., Heat the remaining butter in the pan, peel the shallots, halving any larger ones, peel and cut the carrots into 2cm slices and fry for 8 minutes, or until the veg gets some colour, stirring occasionally. Peel and chop the garlic and add for the final 2 minutes., Add the thyme, bay and wine. Strain in the porcini liquid into the pan, roughly chop the porcini and add to the pan along with the tomato purée, then simmer for 25 minutes, or until the wine has reduced slightly and the veg are cooked through. Season to taste and fish out the thyme stalks and bay leaves., Stir the cooked mushrooms into the sauce along with any juices, heating through for a couple of minutes. Season and serve. Nice with some creamy mash on the side."

Trim and chop the chicken thighs, then peel and crush the garlic. Add both to the casserole dish along with the rice and stock. Pick in most of the thyme leaves, reserving a few for garnish. Stir everything to combine, cover tightly with tinfoil and cook for 35 to 40 minutes, until the rice is cooked., Meanwhile, chop up the butter and finely grate the Parmesan. When the risotto is ready, remove from the oven and add the butter and cheese to the risotto. Season with sea salt and black pepper, then stir for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the risotto thickens. Divide between bowls and top with extra Parmesan to serve."

Leave to one side for about 5 minutes – the mushrooms will have soaked up some of the liquid and be nice and rehydrated., Strain through a fine sieve, reserving the liquid, then roughly chop., Place a pan over a medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Peel and finely slice to the garlic, pick the thyme leaves and add both to the pan when the oil is hot., Once it begins to colour, tear in the fresh and rehydrated mushrooms along with the soaking liquid. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until all cooked down with a beautiful rich flavour, stirring continuously., Remove from the pan and briefly blitz in a food processor or roughly chop on a board. Leave to cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a bowl., Roughly chop the butter into cubes and add to the mushroom mix (it will start to melt a little with the heat)., Pick the parsley leaves and roughly chop, then stir through the mushrooms, with 1 teaspoon of truffle oil and a good pinch of sea sat and black pepper., Peel and roughly chop the onion into wedges. Trim the celery and fennel, then chop the celery into 3cm chunks and cut the fennel into wedges. Add the veg to a large roasting tray along with the tomatoes and wine., To prep the chicken, carefully place a rubber spatula under the skin – the easiest way to do this is from behind the neck. Gently push the spatula under the skin from the front, working your way across while moving towards to the back. Once you have created the space, carefully stuff (or pipe) the mushroom filling into it, massaging on the outside and pushing it in an even layer across the underside of the skin., Place the chicken in the tray on top of the veg, drizzle over 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season generously. Roast for 1 hour 40 minutes, or until cooked through, but check after 1 hour 30 minutes. Cover with tin foil for the last 20 minutes if it is getting too much colour., Leave to rest for 10 minutes. Delicious served with seasonal steamed greens and boiled or roast potatoes."

Tip the pistachios onto a board and roughly chop. Reduce the heat to medium, then return the pan to the heat., Place the mushrooms into the hot pan and cover with a lid. Cook for 5 minutes, or until softened and cooked through. Remove the lid and fry for another 4 minutes, or until golden, turning halfway., Pick and finely chop the parsley leaves, then trim and finely slice the spring onions., Rub the blackened skin off the cooled peppers, then halve and deseed. Tear into strips and set aside on a plate with the juices., Stir the parsley and spring onions through the cooked rice with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of pepper. Sprinkle in the lemon zest and squeeze over the remaining juice., Pile the herby rice onto plates. Remove the mushrooms to a clean board and slice up, then toss with the peppers and resting juices. Spoon onto the rice, crumble over the feta, scatter the pistachios on top, then serve with the lemony yoghurt on the side."

casserole pan on a medium-high heat with the cashews until everything is just starting to catch, tossing often., Tip into a blender with the lime leaves, turmeric, fish sauce, 1 teaspoon of black pepper and a pinch of sea salt and blitz into a paste., Return the pan to a medium heat and dry char the mushrooms for 5 minutes so they get dark golden and nutty., Cut the cheeks off the mango and peel, then cut both the mango and chicken breasts into 1cm slices., Remove the mushrooms to a plate, then add 1 tablespoon of oil and the paste to the pan.

Trim and very finely slice the remaining mushrooms., Once softened, mash the cauliflower mixture with a fork until broken down, but still with a bit of texture. Stir in the ricotta, then season to taste with sea salt, black pepper and the juice from half the lemon., Reserving a cupful of the cooking water, drain the pasta and return it to the pan, off the heat. Tip in the sauce and stir well, adding splashes of the cooking water to loosen, if needed.

the marinade, place the ingredients in a large bowl with 2 tablespoons of water and a pinch of sea salt and white pepper. Mix to combine., Immerse the pork in the marinade, and set aside., Soak the shiitake mushrooms in a hot water for 30 minutes., To make the ma po sauce, soak the dried chillies in water to soften. Place the black beans in another bowl of water and leave to soak for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, prepare your ma po bean curd. Cut the curd into 2.5cm cubes and place in a bowl of hot water for 4 minutes. Drain and set aside., Return to the ma po sauce. Deseed, roughly chop and blend the red pepper in a food processor with a splash of water until it forms a purée., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok over a medium–high heat and deep-fry the peppercorns for 1 to 2 minutes, until fragrant., Drain the oil, grind the peppercorns in a pestle and mortar, then transfer to a bowl., Peel the garlic, then peel and dice the onion. Drain the softened chillies, then dice along with the fresh chillies., Using the pestle and mortar again, grind the garlic, shallot, onion and chillies until combined., Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in the wok until just smoking. Add the ground shallot mixture and stir-fry over a low heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until fragrant., Drain and stir in the soaked black beans, the ground bean paste and remaining oil, one spoonful at a time, and stir-fry until everything is combined., Add the oyster sauce, sugar, ½ tablespoon of salt and the puréed pepper, and stir-fry for another 5 minutes., Lastly, stir in the ground peppercorns. You won’t need all of this sauce – store what you don’t use in a sterilised jar., To prepare the pork, peel and very finely chop the garlic, then peel and finely grate the ginger. Drain the shiitake mushrooms, remove the stalks and roughly chop. Rinse and finely chop the preserved veg., Heat the oil in the wok and stir-fry the pork over a high heat for 4 minutes, or until about 80 per cent cooked., Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, ginger, mushroom, preserved veg, shaoxing wine, stock and 2 to 3 tablespoons of your ma po sauce. Cook, stirring, for 20 seconds., Add ¼ teaspoon of salt and all the bean curd ingredients apart from the cornflour, and simmer for 1–1½ minutes, until the curd has absorbed all the flavours., Combine the cornflour with 2 tablespoons of water to make a paste, then stir it into the pan until the sauce is slightly thickened., Transfer to a serving dish, finely slice and sprinkle over the spring onion, then serve with steamed rice."

sauce","Before you start, soak the porcini mushrooms in boiling water and set aside., Peel and finely slice the garlic and onions (keep them separate), and pick the thyme leaves. Dice the potatoes., Heat a lug of oil in a large pan and fry the garlic, thyme leaves and butter over a medium heat until lightly golden., Add the onions, turn down the heat and sauté for 10 minutes, or until soft and sticky, but not coloured., Add the fresh mushrooms, turn up the heat and fry hard and fast for 5 minutes., Fish out and chop half of the soaked porcini, add to the pan and fry for a few more minutes., Add 350ml of the stock and the potatoes and season well. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for 30 minutes., Using a stick blender, blitz the mushrooms just a little – you want them to still be fairly chunky., Pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, then stir about half into the mix., Divide the filling between 6 small pie dishes, reserving 4 heaped tablespoons for later., Chop the Tunworth into 1-2cm pieces and scatter evenly into each of the pie dishes., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., To make the lids, roll out the pastry on a flour-dusted surface to roughly the thickness of a pound coin., Cut into 6 pieces, to the shape of your pie dishes, and lay one over the top of each, tucking the edges down slightly. Carefully score each pie lid with a crisscross, then gently press your thumb in the middle of each one to make a well (without puncturing the pastry)., Beat the egg and brush it over the pies, then place in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until puffed up and beautifully golden., Now to make the sauce. In a pan, stir the mustard and Worcestershire sauce into the remaining filling., Pour in the leftover porcini liquid, then roughly chop the remaining porcini and add to the mix., Place the pan over a high heat, pour in the remaining stock and bring everything to the boil. Stir in the rest of the parsley a minute or two before the end, then blitz in a liquidiser until smooth and pour into a jug., To serve, pour the gravy into the wells of the pies, and serve with a dollop of English mustard."

It will take about 5 minutes to get a lovely golden colour. You may need to cook the chicken in batches if you have a small pan. Use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken pieces and set aside., Pour away any excess fat and then, in the same pan, cook the bacon lardons and onions for about 5 minutes until they have taken on some colour., Add the sweet potato and mushrooms and then return the chicken pieces to the pan, placing them on top, skin side up., Pour over the stock until it just reaches the chicken skin, add the thyme and cover with a lid., Leave to simmer very gently for about 10–15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. The cooking time will depend on the size of the chicken pieces so do check by removing a piece of chicken and cutting into it with a sharp knife., If you end up having more sauce than you’d like in the pan, simply strain into a clean saucepan, bring to the boil and reduce down and thicken by boiling it."

the onion., Heat a splash of oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then slowly cook the whole garlic and sliced onion for 30 minutes, or until sweet and sticky – keep the lid on the pan for the first 20 minutes to keep in all the moisture, then remove for the final 10 minutes so they get a little colour., Add 2 litres of water to the pan. When it comes to the boil, turn the heat down to low and simmer for 20 minutes., Preheat the oven to 120ºC/gas ¼., Remove any tough stalky bits from the kale leaves, then place a third of the leaves in a low-sided baking tray (this will ensure it crisps up)., Toss it with a little drizzle of oil, then spread the leaves out so they’re not overlapping. Roast for 30 minutes, or until crisp and still green., Strain the broth through a sieve and, using a large metal spoon, squash the onion and garlic to release the flavour back into the pan., In a small bowl, mix both miso pastes and the tahini with a little of the broth to loosen it all up. Stir this back into the main pan and season with soy sauce and mirin., Keep the broth warm until everything else is ready., Blanch the remaining kale in your broth for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with tongs and set half to one side – it is perfect as it is. The other half is going to become the pickle., When the kale for pickling is cool enough to handle, squeeze out all the juice into the broth, and put the kale in a bowl., Scrunch roughly with the sugar, vinegar and a pinch of sea salt, then finely slice and toss through the red chilli., Thickly slice and dry-fry the mushrooms in a frying pan for about 10 minutes, or until they look a bit wrinkly and have stopped releasing water., Pour in the teriyaki and a splash of oil and keep them all moving around the pan for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they have soaked it all up and they are dark and shiny., Cook the noodles in the broth, according to the packet instructions. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan., Once everything is ready, divide the noodles and broth between four bowls, along with the mushrooms, pickled kale, blanched kale and crispy kale for the top., Sprinkle over the toasted seeds, then serve with chilli sauce and toasted sesame oil for drizzling over."

Rub the veal all over with oil and a pinch each of sea salt and black pepper. Place it in the pan and sear all over for 3 to 4 minutes, until golden brown., Transfer the veal to the baking tray and brush the top with the mustard., Place the porcini in a small bowl, cover with boiling water and leave for a couple of minutes for the mushrooms to rehydrate and soften. Pick the sage leaves., In a food processor, add the porcini, bread, chestnuts, sage, a pinch of salt and pepper and a decent splash of oil. Pulse until it all comes together to form a coarse paste., Spoon the chestnut crust onto the veal and pat it down firmly. Place the rack in the oven for 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for at least 30 minutes., While the veal is resting, make the sauce. Squeeze the orange juice into a saucepan and combine with the remaining ingredients, plus any cooking juices from the veal pan. Place over a low heat, stirring, until smooth and combined., Season the sauce to taste and serve with the veal rack and some steamed winter greens."

Pick the thyme leaves and tear the stale bread into small chunks., Lightly toast the nuts in a dry frying pan, then roughly chop. Pick and roughly chop the parsley., Cover the porcini with 300ml of boiling water and leave aside to rehydrate., Heat the oil in a large, wide pan and add the shallot and garlic. Cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 8 minutes or until the shallot is softened but not coloured., Drain the soaked porcini over a bowl, reserving the liquid. Add these and the rest of the mushrooms to the pan along with the bay and thyme leaves and cook until all the mushrooms are well softened. If they release a lot of liquid, pour it onto the diced bread and carry on cooking., When the mushrooms are tender and browned, tip the mixture into a large bowl and leave to cool completely., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Once the cooked mushroom mixture has cooled, add the chunks of bread, a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, the pecans or hazelnuts and about half of the porcini’s reserved soaking liquid (make sure you pour it through a sieve first to stop any grit getting through). Combine well., If the stuffing seems too dry, just add a little more of the reserved porcini liquid., Add most of the parsley and stir it through then tip the stuffing into a lightly greased baking dish of approximately 20cm x 25cm and cover with foil., Place in the oven and bake for 35 minutes, then remove the foil and cook for a further 10 minutes.

Using a small cutter or wine glass, about 6cm across, cut out 12 rounds (you may need to re-roll the pastry)., Place the circles on the baking tray and prick their centres several times with a fork. Beat the egg, then eggwash the circles. Bake on the top shelf of the oven for about 12 minutes until puffed up, crisp and golden. 

Roughly chop or tear the mushrooms, peel and finely slice the garlic, and crumble the chilli (if using). Pick and roughly chop the parsley., Heat a lug of oil in a large pan and cook the mushrooms, garlic and chilli (if using), until golden., Off the heat, squeeze in the lemon juice, then add the crème fraîche. Season well and fold through the parsley. If the mushrooms are too dry, add a splash of water to loosen the sauce., For the vol-au-vents, cut a very thin layer off the top of each circle and use your knife to carefully hollow out a hole in each one., Fill with the creamy mushrooms and serve – you can pop the pastry lids back on, if you wish."

Once hot, put heaped spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan to give you six popovers. Leave them to get nicely golden for a few minutes, then flip over and gently flatten to 1cm thick with a palette knife., Once golden on both sides, remove the popovers from the pan for a moment, then turn the heat off., Finely grate the Parmesan into the pan to melt. Place the popovers on top, wait for the Parmesan to sizzle and go golden from the residual heat of the pan, then use your palette knife to gently push the cheese towards each popover., Once the crispy popovers can be easily prised away from the pan with your palette knife, bang them out on to a board., Swirl some chilli sauce through the yoghurt, toss the rocket in a squeeze of lemon juice and serve both on the side, then enjoy!"

Add the olive oil, butter and garlic to a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Fry for 1 minute, add the mushrooms and chilli, then pick in the thyme leaves. Season with salt and pepper, add 100ml of boiling water, then cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until softened., Meanwhile, make the fritters. Place the ricotta into a large bowl and beat until smooth. Add the flour, egg and a few gratings of lemon zest. Finely grate in the Parmesan and ¼ of a nutmeg, season with salt and pepper and mix well to combine., Heat a good splash of olive oil in a medium pan over a medium heat, then add heaped tablespoons of the mixture (you’ll need to do this in batches), making sure you space them out nicely.

Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper., Peel and finely chop the onion, then trim and finely chop the celery. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, then add the chopped veg. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden. Meanwhile, finely chop the mushrooms., Peel and crush in the garlic, then add the chopped mushrooms. Cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms start to soften. Add the mustard and wine, season with salt and pepper, then reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until all the liquid has boiled and bubbled away. Set aside to cool., Add the cooled mushroom mixture and breadcrumbs to a large bowl. Pick, finely chop and add the parsley leaves, then pick in the thyme leaves. Stir well to combine, then season to taste., Cut the sheets of puff pastry in half lengthways so you have four equal-sized pieces. Spoon a quarter of the mushroom mixture along the middle of one length of pastry, moulding it into a long sausage shape with the back of a spoon., Brush the almond milk along the pastry edges, then carefully fold one of the long sides of the pastry up over the filling. Press the edges to seal, then crimp with a fork. Repeat with the remaining ingredients until you have four long rolls, then cut each length into four pieces., Place the rolls on the prepared baking tray, brush with the almond milk and sprinkle over the sesame seeds. Pop on the bottom shelf of the hot oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden, then serve."

large baking tray to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Start by making the pastry. Sift the flour and xanthan gum into a food processor, add the margarine, vegetable shortening and a pinch of sea salt, and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. If you don’t have a food processor, place the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and cut together with the flat of a knife., Add 2 tablespoons of cold water, pulsing as you go (or stirring with a flat-bladed knife, if making the pastry by hand), until the mixture begins to pull together to form a dough., Tip the pastry into a large bowl (or keep in the same bowl, if making it by hand) and, using your fingertips, pull together into a ball. Knead lightly for about 2 minutes  or until smooth and elastic., Shape the pastry into a ball and place between 2 large sheets of clingfilm, then roll it out into a circle slightly larger than the tart tin and no thinner than 3mm. Peel off the uppermost sheet of clingfilm and carefully flip the pastry into a deep 23cm tart tin. Peel away the remaining clingfilm and gently press the pastry into the sides of the tin, filling in any cracks with pastry and patting it flat with your fingertips. Trim the edges and set aside., Next, prepare the potatoes. Peel and cut in half, quartering any large ones. Place in a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. The second the water begins to boil, time the potatoes, allowing them to cook for  4 minutes before removing from the heat and draining. Shake the potatoes in the colander a little to chuff up the edges – this helps them crisp up., Pour 8 tablespoons of the groundnut oil into a large roasting tin, tip in the potatoes and 1 heaped teaspoon of sea salt and firmly shake to coat evenly. Set aside while you make the filling for the tart., Finely chop the onion, crush the garlic, then finely grate the carrots. Trim the stalks from the chestnut mushrooms and slice into rounds. Halve 240g of the chestnuts (the rest will be used for the topping)., Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy-based frying pan until hot, add the onions and cook gently over a low heat until softened. Add the carrots, garlic, thyme and mushrooms, and fry gently until softened and all of the liquid from the mushrooms has been absorbed – around 10 minutes., Stir in the cream cheese and halved chestnuts and mix together gently until the cheese has softened and formed a creamy mixture. Season to taste, spoon the filling into the pastry case then level the top., Place the tart on the baking tray on the top shelf of the oven and the potatoes on the bottom shelf. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is crisp., Remove the tart from the oven, cover loosely in foil to retain its heat and set aside. Move the potatoes to the top shelf of the oven and increase the temperature to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Continue roasting the potatoes for a further 25 to 30 minutes until golden and crisp., For the gravy, heat the walnut oil and redcurrant jelly in a small saucepan, stirring until melted and smooth. Add the hot stock, bring to a simmer and stir in the cornflour. Simmer gently and stir continuously until you have the desired consistency. Set aside., Finally, tear the wild mushrooms into pieces, roughly chop the remaining chestnuts and finely chop the parsley. Heat the garlic oil in a heavy-based frying pan until hot, add the mushrooms and fry gently until softened. Stir in the chestnuts, cranberries and parsley, and spoon over the tart to form a decorative layer. Reheat the gravy and serve with the tart and roast potatoes."

Transfer to a food processor, along with the chestnut purée, suet and maple syrup, and blitz until it comes together into a ball. It will be sticky to begin with, so stop and scrape the sides as you go., Place a large sheet of greaseproof paper on a work surface and sit the dough on it. Then, with lots of gluten-free flour on your hands and rolling pin, roll out the dough as thinly as possible (less than 5mm)., If you’re making individual tartlets, oil and flour four 10cm loose-bottomed tart tins, then cut the pastry to size. For 1 large tart, roll out the dough and cut to the size of a large, shallow baking tin, and transfer to the tin using a fish slice., Prick the pastry all over with a fork, cover with greaseproof paper, fill with baking beans or rice and bake blind for 12 to 15 minutes. Leave to cool in the tray, and keep the oven on., Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms. Heat 1 tablespoon of rapeseed oil in a pan over a medium heat, then sauté the mushrooms for 6 to 8 minutes, until golden. Remove and set aside., In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of rapeseed oil and wilt the spinach (or heat through if frozen) along with the pepper. Blitz the spinach, avocado flesh, tofu, nutmeg and lemon juice in a food processor until smooth., Thinly slice the sweet potato using a vegetable peeler or mandolin, creating a pile of peelings. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a small pan, then fry the peelings over a high heat, turning occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes, until just turning crisp., Assemble the tart by spreading the spinach mixture over the baked and cooled tart base. Lay the mushrooms on top, and decorate with the sweet potato slivers and a scattering of toasted pine nuts. Eat at room temperature, or heat it up, if you like."

Pick the coriander leaves and set aside, then finely slice the stalks. Heat a splash of groundnut oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, then add the garlic, ginger and coriander stalks. Fry for around 3 minutes, or until golden. Slice the mushrooms, then add to the pan for around 5 minutes, or until lightly golden brown., Add the vinegar, chilli sauce and soy, then cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the liquid has boiled and bubbled away and the mushrooms are golden brown and starting to caramelise. Transfer to a bowl., Trim and finely slice the spring onions, then add the white part to the bowl. Deseed and finely slice the chilli, then add half to the bowl, reserving the rest for later. Stir in 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, then set aside., Add the coconut milk, 2 heaped tins’ worth of flour and a good pinch of sea salt to a food processor. Whiz to a dough, then transfer to a flour-dusted surface and roll into a thick sausage. Cut into 12 equal-sized pieces, roll into balls, then flatten into rounds, roughly ½cm thick., Equally divide the mushroom mixture between each of the 12 dough circles (you'll need roughly 1 tablespoon of filling per circle), making sure to leave a 2cm gap around the edges. Pull and fold the sides over the filling, pinching the edges together to seal. Place upside-down (so the scruffy edges are underneath) in double-layered, lightly greased muffin cases and divide between two bamboo steamer baskets., Place a wok over a high heat, then fill with 1 litre of boiling water and pop the steamer baskets on top. Reduce the heat to medium and steam for around 12 minutes, or until piping hot through and puffed up., Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Once the buns are ready, sprinkle over the seeds and the reserved spring onions and chilli. Tear the coriander leaves on top, then serve with hoisin sauce for dipping."

Tear off a double layer of wide tin foil and place the celeriac in the middle, root side up., Rub with olive oil, sea salt and black pepper, sprinkle over the thyme sprigs and 6 bay leaves, then bash 4 whole cloves of garlic and scatter over. Pull the sides of the foil up really tightly around the celeriac and scrunch around its shape, leaving it open at the top., Place the butter on top of the celeriac so that it melts down and around it as it cooks, then fold the foil over really tightly to seal. Place in an ovenproof dish and roast for around 2 hours, or until tender., Meanwhile, cook the pearl barley at the appropriate time according to packet instructions., Peel and finely slice the onion and remaining garlic, place in a large frying pan on a low heat with a lug of olive oil, and fry for around 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Finely slice the mushrooms and add (your pan will be very full, but trust me, they will cook down nicely). Cook for around 20 minutes, or until golden, continuing to stir occasionally., Crumble in the stock cube, add the remaining bay leaf and pour in 200ml of boiling water. Simmer and reduce until the liquid has nearly gone, then stir in the cream and mustard and simmer for a further 5 minutes. Season to perfection and keep warm until needed, being careful not to let it get too thick., Around 10 minutes before the celeriac is ready, carefully open up the foil and start basting every couple of minutes with the melted butter for extra colour., Drain the pearl barley and dress it with salt, pepper and extra virgin olive oil. Place the celeriac on a board and carve thinly, like you would a joint of meat. Drizzle with any juices from the foil, then serve with the mushroom sauce, pearl barley and lots of beautiful seasonal greens."

Place both in a frying pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil., Strip in the thyme leaves and fry it all for 5 to 8 minutes, or until golden, stirring occasionally. Roughly chop the porcini and add to the pan, then pour in their soaking liquor (discarding just the last gritty bit)., Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until thickened and reduced, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Leave to cool., Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6.  Remove the chicken from the fridge and let it come up to room temperature., Place the flour in a bowl, then gradually pour in 1.2 litres of ice-cold water, stirring continuously until combined. Use your hands to bring it together into a soft, elastic dough, then cover with a damp tea towel and put aside., Transfer the mushroom mixture to a board with the top leafy half of the parsley, add a few drops of truffle oil, then roughly chop together. Scrape into a bowl, then squidge and mix in the butter., Carefully lift up and push your fingers or a spoon between the chicken breast and skin on both sides of the bird to create pockets for your flavoured butter – be careful not to rip the skin., Rub most of the butter on to the breast meat, then replace the skin and massage the remaining butter all over. Tie the legs together with string., Roll out one third of the dough into a rectangle 1cm thick and just slightly bigger than the chicken, then sit the chicken on top. Roll out the remainder of the dough to 1cm thick and big enough to cover the chicken. Place the dough over the top, pressing the edges together to create a sealed parcel., Place in a large roasting tray and cook in the oven for 1 hour 40 minutes – be exact with your timings, as you won’t be able to check whether it’s cooked until you carve the crust open., Remove to a board to rest for 30 minutes, then break open the crust with a knife and discard (you don’t eat the crust). Check that the chicken is cooked through, then carve it up and serve. Perfect with creamy mash and steamed seasonal greens."

Strip all the meat you can find off the chicken carcass, and put aside., Place the carcass and any bones in a large pan and use a rolling pin to smash them all up. Cover with 1 litre of water, bring to the boil, then simmer for at least 30 minutes, skimming away any scum from the surface., Meanwhile, finely slice the bacon and place in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with a lug of oil, while you peel and chop the onions, carrots, and potatoes or celeriac into 2cm dice., Add to the pan along with the thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly., Halve and stir in the mushrooms, along with the leftover chicken and plain flour., Pour the stock through a sieve straight into the pan (topping up with a little water, if needed) and let it simmer for 20 minutes, or until thick and delicious, while you start your dumplings., Place the self-raising flour and a pinch of sea salt in a mixing bowl. Coarsely grate in the butter and rub together until it resembles breadcrumbs., Add 100ml of cold water and bring into a ball of dough. Divide into 12 pieces and roll into balls., When the time’s up, loosen the stew with a good splash of water if needed, season to perfection, then transfer it to an ovenproof pan and place the balls on top., Pop the lid on and bake at 190°C/375°F/gas 5 for 30 minutes, or until hot through and the dumplings are fluffy and cooked. Serve with some seasonal greens."

                 , (cold)","Place a large casserole pan on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil and the butter. Peel, finely slice and add the onions, then pick, finely chop and add the rosemary and thyme, along with the bay leaves. Cook for 20 minutes, or until the onions are soft and turning golden, stirring occasionally., Slice the beef into rough 2cm strips, then clean and slice the mushrooms. Add both to the pan along with the tomato purée and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Stir in the balsamic, stout, flour and stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour 20 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the meat is tender., Meanwhile, for the pastry, put the flour and a good pinch of salt into a bowl with the suet, cube and add the butter, then use your thumb and forefingers to rub the fat into the flour until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs., Slowly stir in 125ml of ice-cold water, then use your hands to gently bring it together into a ball, but don’t overwork it. Wrap in clingfilm and place in the fridge for later., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Ladle the stew into pie dishes – you can make a collection of small pies, or one or two larger ones – then finely grate or crumble over the cheese., Roll out the pastry on a clean flour-dusted surface, so it’s slightly bigger than your pie dishes. Eggwash the edges of the dishes, then carefully place the pastry on top, trimming off any overhang. Pinch the edges to seal., Decorate the tops with any offcuts, if you like, then brush with a little more egg. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the pastry is beautifully golden. Delicious served with steamed seasonal greens."

beaten","Dad and I had a really interesting conversation about smaller families not wanting whole turkeys for their dinner. So we had a scout around the supermarkets and developed a really delicious and impressive recipe for this. It’s dramatic and stretches the meat a fairly long way. The case of pastry and minced mushrooms keeps the breast moist and delicious and is a little forgiving so the meat holds its juices. You could assemble it a day before and just leave it in the fridge ready to over deliver on Christmas day., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Place the turkey breast upside-down on a board. Gently slice into the natural join of the breast muscle to open it out and make a sort of pocket. Season well and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle over half the thyme leaves, then spread over an even layer of cranberry jam, pushing it into all the nooks and crannies. Fold it back into shape to seal the mixture inside – swiss roll-stylie – and push a few cocktail sticks into the seam to keep it together. Transfer the turkey to a roasting tray, season the outside with the remaining thyme leaves, a good pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Rub it all over, cover in tin foil and roast in the hot oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until just cooked through – using a thermometer, you want it to be 72°C at the thickest point., Meanwhile, soak the porcini in a dish of just-boiled water. After 5 minutes, stir with a fork so any bits of grit sink to the bottom. Add the bacon to a large frying pan with a splash of oil on a medium heat and fry for 5 to 10 minutes, or until beautifully golden and super crispy. Strip in the leaves from 2 rosemary sprigs for the last 30 seconds or so. Remove everything from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat behind. Add the fresh mushrooms to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper. Drain and chop the porcini, saving the water, then stir into the pan. Add a splash of the water, avoiding the grit, then cook for around 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pan starts to sizzle again and the mushrooms are golden, soft and sticky with caramelly edges., To make the gravy, cut the thigh off the turkey leg and slash into it slightly. Throw the leg and thigh into a pot along with the carrot, leek and onion. Stir in the flour, add a good pinch of salt and pepper and 2 litres of boiling water. Add a heaped tablespoon of cranberry jam, the balsamic vinegar and remaining rosemary sprig. Bring back to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for around 2 hours, or until thick. Strain it through a sieve and reheat before serving., When the mushroom pan is dry, add a knob of butter and toss to coat.  Tip the mushrooms into the food processor and whiz until you get a good mixture of smooth and chunky. Leave to cool. Once the turkey breast and stuffing have cooled, you can get on with assembling the wellington., Dust a clean surface with flour, then roll out each packet of puff pastry to the size of a shoe box (one will be the base, one the lid – roll the lid ever so slightly bigger). Line a large roasting tray with greaseproof paper, dust with flour, then add the smaller piece of pastry. Spread half of the mushroom stuffing onto the middle of the base to cover an area the same size as your turkey breast. Remove the cocktail sticks, then place the turkey breast on top and spread the remaining stuffing over the top packing it all in and smoothing it out so that the whole breast is covered.  Sprinkle with the crispy bacon and rosemary, then brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg. Lay the second sheet of pastry over the top, gently mold it round the shape of the breast, pushing all the air out and seal together. Trim the edges  to around 4cm, then pull, twist, tuck and pinch in the pastry (like in the picture)., Brush the whole thing with beaten egg then all the hard work’s done. Leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight until you’re ready to cook. On Christmas day, cook at 180°/350°F/gas 4 for 50 to 60 minutes, or until risen, puffy and beautifully golden and the turkey is piping hot throughout. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for around 10 minutes before carving. Serve carved into 2.5cm with the gravy and all the usual. Christmas in a mouthful."

Slice the squash lengthways into wedges and add to a large roasting tray with a good splash of olive oil, the chilli and cinnamon. Bash the coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar until fine, then add the rosemary leaves and bash again for 1 to 2 minutes to release its flavour. Scatter over the squash and toss together so that each piece of squash is well coated with the seasoning. Make sure all the squash is skin-side down, then cover with tin foil and bake in the hot oven for around 45 minutes or until soft. Allow to cool, then tear into bite-sized chunks., Meanwhile, heat a saucepan over a medium heat, then add a splash of olive oil and the onions. Season well with salt and pepper and cook gently, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned. Add the sage and crumbled chestnuts to the pan for the last few minutes of cooking., While that’s happening, toast the bread on a hot griddle pan or in a toaster and rub well with one of the cloves of garlic. Tear into small chunks, and once the onions are done, add the toast to the pan. Turn the heat off, stir everything together, taste, then season and grate in the zest of the lemon., Add the butter to a frying pan on a medium heat and when melted, add the mushrooms and a chopped clove of garlic. Fry until soft and quite dry. Squeeze in a little lemon juice, tip into a food processor and whiz until smooth., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the spinach and cook until soft. Drain in a colander, pressing lightly to get rid of excess moisture, then place to one side., Slice the remaining garlic clove and add to a frying pan with a splash of olive oil. Fry until golden. Add the pine nuts, sultanas and spinach and fry everything together until warmed through. Season well with salt and pepper and turn off the heat., Now assemble your Wellington. Roll out the puff pastry on a sheet of baking parchment until it’s about 30cm x 40cm, then spread the mushroom mixture all over it. In a large bowl, lightly toss together the spinach, squash and onion-bread mixture, then spoon it in a thick line down the middle of the pastry. Leave a space free at either side so you can roll the pastry around the filling., To do this, hold one side of the baking parchment and lift it, with the pastry, towards the centre of the Wellington so it starts to cover the filling. Peel the baking parchment back, leaving the pastry in place, then do the same with the other side. The pastry should overlap in the middle. Beat the egg with the milk and brush it over the pastry join to seal the join. Fold up the ends so the filling doesn’t leak out, then carefully roll the Wellington onto a baking sheet, with the seal underneath. Brush all over with the egg mix., Bake for 45 minutes until puffed up, golden brown and hot through. Serve carved into thick chunks – it’s fantastic served with veggie gravy!"

I think that’s a real shame because it adds such beautiful flavour and the natural juices from the chicken will give you the most gorgeous stuffing., Preheat your oven to 240°C/475°F/gas 9. Heat a good lug of olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add your onion and garlic and cook for about 10 minutes until soft, but not coloured. Add the mushrooms with the leaves from a few of your thyme sprigs. Turn the heat up to high and fry for 5 to 10 minutes until the mushrooms go slightly crispy. Remove from the heat, grate in the zest of the lemon and season well. Tip into a bowl and leave to one side to cool., Once the mixture has cooled, use clean hands to mix in the pine nuts and breadcrumbs, then add the egg. Carefully, push your fingers between the meat and skin on the top of the chicken then gently create a pocket for the stuffing. Push a quarter of the stuffing into this pocket and roll the remaining mixture into balls and pop to one side. Cut your zested lemon in half and place in the chicken cavity with the remaining thyme sprigs. Pop your chicken in a roasting tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper., Place in the preheated oven and turn the heat down to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Cook for 40 minutes, then add your mushroom stuffing balls to the tray. Return to the oven and cook for a further 35 minutes until gorgeous and golden. To check your chicken is cooked, stick a skewer into the fattest part of the thigh – if the juices run clear, your chicken is done. Leave to rest for 10 to 15 minutes, covered loosely with tin foil, then serve with fluffy roast potatoes and seasonal greens."

It’s an exciting dish and the end result will definitely blow you away, but you’ll have to take a bit of time with it and show it some love., You’ll want to buy the pork from a good butcher and ask for a boneless loin of pork with the skin off (but keep it for crackling) and belly on. Keeping the belly on makes stuffing the pork much easier. A nice little tip is to ask your butcher to give you the bones, as these will make a brilliant trivet to roast your meat on., Preheat your oven to its highest setting. Tear or roughly chop your mushrooms – thick, thin and wonky, it doesn’t matter, you want it chunky and rustic. Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat, add a lug of olive oil, the thyme leaves and mushrooms, and toss around a bit. Next, add the sliced garlic and knob of butter. Fry everything off for about 10 minutes until the mushrooms are browning a little around the edges. Add the lemon zest with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then remove to a bowl and let it cool. Once cool, add the bread and toss together., Now turn your attention to the pork. Lay the loin and belly on a board, fatty-side down, and use a knife to make a little pocket between the loin and the belly meat. Stuff the cooled mushroom mixture into the pocket, then season well all over with salt and pepper. If you’ve got any garlicky, thyme and lemon juices left in the pan, pour these over the pork for some wonderful added flavour. Rub all the seasoning and juices into the pork., Roll the belly around the loin and tie it tightly with 5 or 6 pieces of string to keep it all in place. If your butcher gave you the bones, scatter them around the bottom of an appropriately sized roasting tray – you want the pork to sit quite snugly in the tray - and put the meat on top. Place in the oven and immediately turn it down to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 so the meat cooks through nice and evenly. This is a good time to get the crackling ready for the oven, so score the skin with a small sharp knife to open it up for seasoning. Bash up the fennel seeds and salt in a pestle and mortar, rub a generous amount of this into the skin and place it on a baking tray., After the meat has had an hour in the oven, take it out and add the chopped vegetables and remaining bulb of garlic to the tray, roughly broken apart into unpeeled cloves. Pour in the glass of cider and give the tray a shake to coat everything. Put it all back in the oven to cook for another hour. The crackling can also go in at this point., Before the second hour is up, put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Peel and cut the celeriac and potatoes into even-sized chunks, then boil for 12 to 15 minutes until soft and ready to mash. Drain and let them steam-dry, then return to the pan with a good knob of butter, some seasoning and the milk. Mash until smooth, adding a splash more milk if you need it. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve., When the pork is ready, remove it from the oven on to a plate and cover with tin foil, so it can rest for about 20 minutes while you crack on with the gravy. You’ll have some nice roasted root veg and sticky goodness left in the bottom of the tray. Pour or spoon off the excess fat in the tray, then place it over a very low heat and pour in the stock a little at a time (you may not need to use all of it), using a potato masher as you go to mash up all the vegetables. Keep stirring to make sure you get all the lovely sticky brown bits off the bottom of the tray. Add the flour and keep reducing the gravy down until you get the consistency you like. Pass the gravy through a sieve to get rid of any lumps, then serve with the warm mash, stuffed pork and beautiful crackling."

from the wood. Serve it as a nice autumn supper with a lovely glass of Chianti, or as a starter for a dinner party., Don’t worry if you can't get hold of wild mushrooms – this works just as well with chestnut or field varieties. You can find scamorza, a delicious smoked mozzarella, at Italian delis and most supermarkets, but a good-quality buffalo mozzarella works just as well., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Heat a griddle pan and toast the ciabatta slices until they have lovely dark griddle marks. Tear up the toasted bread into chunks or, if using carta di musica, break up into pieces and toss with a drizzle of olive oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Get yourself a medium-sized earthenware dish, drizzle it with a little olive oil then add the seasoned, toasted bread., In the same bowl you used for the bread, add the sliced garlic, chopped bacon and thyme leaves, then tear over the mushrooms, leaving any little ones whole. Crumble in the dried chilli, then use your hands to toss everything together and get all those wonderful flavours going., Sprinkle this mixture fairly evenly on top of the bread, then tear over big pieces of the scamorza. Give the whole lot one final drizzle of olive oil, and put it in the oven to bake for about 30 minutes, until the mushrooms are beginning to crisp up and the cheese is melted, bubbling and starting to brown., While that bakes, wash and dry the salad leaves, and make a simple dressing by squeezing the juice of half a lemon into a jam jar. Top with twice as much extra virgin olive oil, and add a good pinch of salt and pepper. Put the lid on and give it a good shake, then put it to one side., Once the mushrooms are ready, drizzle some of your jam-jar dressing over the salad (any leftover dressing will keep happily in the fridge for a few days). Serve your beautiful, baked mushrooms and salad in the middle of the table and let everyone dig in."

In fact, they’re so delicious I end up eating them as soon as they come out of the pan, so not all of them make it to the table! You can use one type of mushroom – like I’ve done here with the field mushrooms – or a mixture. Tearing them up into different sizes will add a wonderful mixture of textures, colours and flavours., Start by making your posh, flavoured vinegar. Put the whole sprigs of tarragon and thyme, the peppercorns and garlic slices into a bottle, then top with the vinegar, making sure it completely covers all the herbs and spices. Allow the vinegar to steep for at least a few hours and, remember, the longer you leave it, the more delicious it will become. You can let it infuse for a couple of weeks to really push up the flavour and, as long as you strain the vinegar after this time and bottle it up, you can keep using it for a good few months., Fill a deep pan with the olive oil and let it heat up over a medium heat. Meanwhile, put the flour on a large plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and the lemon zest. Cut or tear the mushrooms into uneven chunks, and sprinkle them with a bit of water to moisten them. Toss handfuls of the mushrooms in the seasoned flour until they are all lightly coated., To test if the oil is hot enough, add a small piece of potato to the pan. Once it begins to sizzle and brown, the oil is ready. Deep-fry the mushrooms in batches – about a handful at a time - until they’re golden brown. The cooking time will depend on the size of the mushrooms but it shouldn’t take more than 3 or 4 minutes – just use your instincts. Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and leave on kitchen paper to drain for a minute. Serve as soon as possible sprinkled with a pinch of salt, some posh vinegar and some roughly chopped parsley. Delicious!"

Get a large casserole-type pan nice and hot, then add a good couple of lugs of olive oil and your fresh mushrooms. Stir around very quickly for a minute, then add your garlic, onion and thyme and a small amount of seasoning. After about a minute you'll probably notice moisture cooking out of the mushrooms and at this point add half of your porcini, chopped up, and the rest left whole. Strain the soaking liquid to remove any grit, and add it to the pan. Carry on cooking for about 20 minutes until most of the moisture disappears., Season to taste, and add your stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for around 20 minutes. I usually remove half the soup from the pan and whiz it up to a purée at this point, then pour it back in, adding the parsley and mascarpone, and seasoning carefully to taste., You can serve this soup as you like, but there are a few things to remember when finishing it off. Mix together a pinch of salt and pepper with the zest of one lemon and the juice of half of it, then spoon a little of this into the middle of the soup. When you go to eat it, stir it in and it gives a wonderful flavour. Other things you can consider are little slices of grilled crostini put into the bottom of the bowls before the soup is poured over. Or you could even quickly fry some nice-looking mushrooms – like girolles, chanterelles or oysters – and sprinkle these on top of the soup. If I was going to use truffle oil, then I would use it on its own – a few drips on the top just before serving.

many different ways, depending on what kind of mushrooms you have and whether they are introduced at the very beginning of cooking or just added at the end, as I’m going to do here. The inspiration for this recipe came when I was in Japan and saw mushrooms being cooked completely dry on a barbecue or griddle pan. This way of cooking brings out a really fresh and nutty flavour in them; perfect for being dressed lightly with olive oil, salt and lemon juice or stirred into a risotto at the last minute before serving., Heat your stock in a saucepan and keep it on a low simmer. Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl and pour in just enough hot stock to cover. Leave for a couple of minutes until they’ve softened. Fish them out of the stock and chop them, reserving the soaking liquid., In a large pan, heat a lug of olive oil and add the onion and celery. Slowly fry without colouring them for at least 10 minutes, then turn the heat up and add the rice. Give it a stir. Stir in the vermouth or wine – it’ll smell fantastic! Keep stirring until the liquid has cooked into the rice. Now pour the porcini soaking liquid through a sieve into the pan and add the chopped porcini, a good pinch of salt and your first ladle of hot stock. Turn the heat down to a simmer and keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next., Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. This will take about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, get a dry griddle pan hot and grill the wild mushrooms until soft. If your pan isn’t big enough, do this in batches. Put them into a bowl and add the chopped herbs, a pinch of salt and the lemon juice. Using your hands, get stuck in and toss everything together – this is going to be incredible!, Take the risotto off the heat and check the seasoning carefully. Stir in the butter and the Parmesan. You want it to be creamy and oozy in texture, so add a bit more stock if you think it needs it. Put a lid on and leave the risotto to relax for about 3 minutes., Take your risotto and add a little more seasoning or Parmesan if you like. Serve a good dollop of risotto topped with some grilled dressed mushrooms, a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

Obviously the better the beef the better the dish. So go for something with good marbling and a bit of integrity. It can be served on a sharing platter with different salads sprinkled on top. The truffle oil’s optional, but the flavour is interesting, so give it a try because it’s something new. This whole dish is impressive and damn tasty., OK, first things first – whack your oven on to its highest heat. For this dish we’re going to cook the meat on the platter it will be served on, so ideally use one of those classic cheap old metal flats or trays. Or you can use regular serving plates instead, if you know they’re heatproof. Rub them with extra virgin olive oil or truffle oil. And now you’re going to prepare the meat. Work with one piece at a time, and put it on a 30cm piece of bin-liner with another piece on top. Using a rolling pin, evenly slap the meat until it’s 4 times the width you started with, but a quarter of the thickness., Lay the meat on your tray, platter or plate right to the edges – you can let it hang over a tiny bit. Put your rosemary leaves into a sieve and run hot water over them to get the oils and flavours going. Put them into a little bowl, pour 3 or 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil on top and massage the leaves with your fingers to get more flavour out of them. Stir the garlic into the rosemary oil, then pat everything evenly all over the meat. The meat can be prepared to this point a few hours in advance, then cling-filmed and kept in the fridge., Now all you’ve got to do is get a little salad together. Tear your rocket and radicchio into a large bowl. Slice your mushrooms as thinly as possible and add them to the bowl., This dish is best put together really quickly at the last minute. All you need to do is put the meat in the preheated oven for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your oven). By the time you’ve dressed the salad, with a little extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper, and put your block of Parmesan on the table with a speed peeler for shaving pieces off it, you can take the meat out of the oven – it should be paler in colour now. The idea is not to cook the meat, it’s simply to warm it through. Scatter the salad over and serve it straight away. Shave over some Parmesan and have a nice glass of wine with it.

Here’s my version..., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Put your porcini mushrooms in a bowl and pour over just enough boiling water to cover them (approx. 150ml/5½fl oz). Put to one side to soak for a few minutes. Heat a saucepan big enough to hold all the ingredients, and pour in a splash of olive oil. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and brown them gently in the oil. Strain the porcini, reserving the soaking water, and add them to the pan with the garlic and fresh mushrooms. Add the wine, with the strained porcini soaking water, and turn the heat down. Simmer gently until the chicken pieces are cooked through and the wine has reduced a little., Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions and drain well. Add the cream to the pan of chicken, then bring to the boil and turn the heat off. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the drained spaghetti to the creamy chicken sauce and toss well. Add three-quarters of the Parmesan and all of the basil and stir well. Transfer to an ovenproof baking dish or non-stick pan, sprinkle with half the remaining cheese and bake in the oven until golden brown, bubbling and crisp. Divide between your plates, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with the rest of the cheese before serving."

Turn the chipolatas over, add the mushrooms to the tray, face up, drizzle with a little oil and season with sea salt and black pepper., Lay the bacon in and around everything and pop the tray back under the grill for another 7 to 8 minutes, or until the chipolatas are cooked through., When the tray of extras is just about perfect, turn the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and pop them down at the bottom of the oven to keep warm,, Give the bubble and squeak one final pat down and use the back of a spoon to make four dents, evenly spaced around the pan. Crack in the eggs – it looks fantastic, isn’t predictable and saves on washing up., Season with a tiny bit of salt and pepper and put in the oven for about 8 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking., To serve, pop the tray of bubble & squeak and eggs in the middle of the table with the tray of extras on the side."

Otherwise use a preheated ridged griddle pan. Slap the cutlets with the heel of your hand to flatten them slightly. Then bash up your thyme in a pestle and mortar and add a little olive oil. Mix together, then rub the oil over the cutlets and season both sides of them. Put to one side., Cook the mushrooms dry on the bars of your hot griddle pan. This is quite an unusual way to do it, but it gives you a nutty flavour that you wouldn’t get otherwise. Just grill them on both sides to mark them and put them into a large bowl. Once the mushrooms are done you can put the lamb on the barbecue or griddle pan. If the cutlets are about 1.5cm thick, just give them 3 or 4 minutes on each side until they’re really golden. This should cook them medium. (To be honest, I’m not really into rare lamb cutlets, but if you prefer them like that then cook for a little less time.), When cooked, put the lamb cutlets into the bowl with the mushrooms and drizzle with a little olive oil. Tear over the parsley, in quite large pieces, and add a good squeeze of lemon juice. Season lightly and toss around. Place to one side to rest, to allow all the lovely juices to get sucked up by the mushrooms., Meanwhile you can make a really quick sauce. It looks a bit like pesto, but although it contains basil and pine nuts it has no similarity in flavour. In a pestle and mortar pound up the pine nuts until you have a mushy pulp – this will give the sauce a creamy flavour and texture. Remove the mixture to a bowl, then use the pestle and mortar to bash the basil up into a pulp. Add this to the pine nuts and loosen with extra virgin olive oil so that the sauce easily drops off the end of a spoon., Now you need to balance it with quite a lot of balsamic vinegar to give it a good zing, almost like a mint sauce, but add it to taste. Give the lamb and mushrooms a final toss. I like to serve this up on a big platter and let everyone help themselves. Have the sauce and a simple watercress salad on the side."

Place a large ovenproof casserole pan on a medium heat., Finely slice the pancetta, pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves, then place both in the pan with 1 tablespoon of oil and the bay leaves. Stir regularly for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, followed by the onion and leek. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, chop the squash or sweet potato (wash first) into bite-sized chunks, leaving the skin on and discarding any squash seeds., I like to cut the stalk and face off the mushrooms because it looks nice – just add the trimmings straight to the pan, along with the whole mushrooms and chopped squash or sweet potato., Remove and discard the chicken skin and add the chicken to the pan. Pour in the wine and let it reduce slightly, then add the tomatoes and break them up with a wooden spoon., Half-fill each tin with water, swirl about, pour into the pan and mix it all together. Destone the olives, then poke them into the stew., Bring to a gentle simmer, then transfer to the oven to cook for 1 hour, or until thick, delicious, the chicken falls off the bone and the squash or sweet potato is lovely and tender., Season to perfection, then serve with bread to mop up that tasty sauce."
