differ for all of us. I’ve given you the recipe for the pigs in blankets and the batter, and everything else is based on what you’ve got – just don’t overload it., Start by moving your oven shelves around so you have plenty of space in the middle of the oven for your Yorkshire to grow., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7., For the Yorkshire, beat the eggs into the flour with a pinch of sea salt, then gradually whisk in the milk to give you a smooth batter, and pour into a jug., Wrap half a rasher of bacon around each sausage, poking in a sage leaf, too. Pop on to a baking tray with the potatoes (roughly chop, if you like), balls or pinches of stuffing, and the sprouts., Pick over the rosemary leaves and place in the top of the oven for 10 minutes., Pour the sunflower oil into a baking dish (25cm x 30cm) and place in the oven on the shelf underneath, to preheat the oil properly., Meanwhile, for the gravy, wash, trim and finely slice the leek, then put it into a frying pan on a medium heat with the butter or dripping. Cook for 10 minutes, or until soft, stirring occasionally., Shred in the turkey meat and stir in the flour and cranberry sauce, followed by the stock., Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thick, then taste and season to perfection., For the next bit, you need to be cool, calm and safe, as you’re working with hot oil, and you want to retain the heat from the oven., Have your jug of batter ready and two oven gloves or tea towels. Keep the tray of oil in the oven and carefully pull the shelf out a little.Holding it steady, pour in the batter, then gently transfer everything from the tray above into the centre., Push the shelf back in and keep the door shut for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the Yorkshire is puffed up and golden., Serve the Christmas toad in the hole with the dirty gravy, any extra cranberry sauce, and with a nice fresh slaw on the side."

Drizzle a little oil into a frying pan over a medium heat and sauté the onion, stirring occasionally, until completely translucent. Stir in the garlic and cook until golden, then remove from the heat and allow to cool., Squeeze the sausagemeat from the skins into a large bowl. Roughly chop the sage leaves and apricots, and stir into the sausagemeat along with the breadcrumbs and cooled onion mixture. Use your hands to bring it all together., Lay the turkey breast on a clean chopping board, skin-side down, and evenly spread the stuffing over the top. With the longest side of the breast closest to you, tightly roll it up, then place seam-side down on the board. Drape the streaky bacon widthways along the length of the turkey., Tie up the turkey breast with 5 or 6 pieces of kitchen string, about 5cm apart, knotting them tightly to secure the roll. Drizzle over a little oil and season with sea salt and black pepper., Place the turkey breast in a roasting tin, cover with tin foil and roast for 1 hour and 20 minutes (or 40 minutes per kilo), removing the foil for the last 20 minutes to allow the bacon to crisp up. Pierce the centre of the turkey and check that the juices run clear., Transfer the turkey to a board, cover with foil and a clean tea towel and allow to rest for 20 to 30 minutes before serving."

becomes super-crisp, like crackling, turning halfway., When it’s golden, strip in the thyme leaves to crisp up for just 10 seconds, then scoop the crispy skin and thyme on to a plate, keeping the pan of flavoursome fat to one side., Peel the onion, wash the leek and trim with the celery, then finely chop it all., Return the pan of fat to a medium heat, then add the veg and fry for 10 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, stirring occasionally, and adding a splash of oil, if needed., Pour the stock into a separate pan and bring to a simmer on a low heat., Stir the rice into the veg for a couple of minutes, then pour in the Prosecco. Let it cook away, then start adding the stock, a ladleful at a time, letting each one cook away before adding more. Keep a close eye on it and stir constantly for 17 minutes, or until the rice is cooked but still retains its shape., Meanwhile, finely chop the turkey meat, stirring it into the pan halfway through the 17 minutes. Reheat your gravy, then sieve it into a pre-warmed jug ready to pour at the table., When the risotto is done, add enough extra stock to make it oozy, then remove from the heat., Finely grate over most of the Parmesan and beat it in with the butter and mascarpone, then taste and season to perfection. Put the lid on and take to the table., Divide between your hot plates, make a well in the middle of each portion and flamboyantly pour in the hot gravy, then crack and crumble the crispy skin and thyme over the top., Finish with a tiny extra grating of Parmesan, and a thimble of new season’s extra virgin olive oil, if you’ve got it."

Higher-welfare birds generally have more intramuscular fat, which means they cook quicker than standard, lean birds. If you’ve got a 7kg bird, like I had here, do it for just over 3 hours, based on the guideline timings above., Just under 1 hour before the time is up, get the tray out of the oven and remove the tin foil., Cover the bird with your rashers of bacon, stretching and weaving them into a criss-cross pattern however you like. Return the turkey to the oven for the remaining time, or until golden and cooked through., The simplest way to check it’s cooked is to stick a knife into the thickest part of the thigh – if the juices run clear, it’s done. If you’re worried, use a meat thermometer. You want to reach an internal temperature of 65ºC for a top-quality bird, such as Paul Kelly’s turkeys, or 70ºC for a supermarket higher-welfare or standard bird., Use heavy-duty tongs to lift up your bird so all the juices run from the cavity into the tray, then transfer the turkey to a platter, cover with a double layer of tin foil and a clean tea towel, and leave to rest for up to 2 hours while you crack on., Use your tray of trivet veg and juices to make your gravy. Place the turkey tray over a medium heat on the hob. Skim away most of the fat from the surface into a jar, cool, and place in the fridge for tasty cooking another day., Stir the flour into the tray, mashing up all the veg and scraping up all the sticky bits from the base. Pour in up to 2 litres of boiling kettle water and simmer until the gravy is the consistency of your liking, then stir in the cranberry sauce., Strain the gravy through a coarse sieve, pushing all the goodness through with the back of a spoon, then season to perfection., Keep warm over the lowest heat until needed, adding any extra resting juices from the turkey before serving."

The added flavour they’ll give your gravy will be incredible – trust me., Peel the onions, wash the carrots and roughly chop with the celery, then add to the tray with the unpeeled garlic cloves., Halve the clementine and chilli and place in the turkey cavity with most of the herbs – not filling it too full allows hot air to circulate, cooking the bird from the inside out and from the outside in., Place the stuffing in the neck cavity (click here for my meat stuffing recipe, or you could use any veggie stuffing), then pull the skin back over it and tuck it under the bird. You’ll get a good contrast between the soft, juicy stuffing here inside the turkey, and the crispier stuff you can bake in a dish, as well., Scrunch and warm the butter in your hands so it’s soft enough to spread all over the bird, getting into all the nooks and crannies. The butter layer serves two purposes – natural basting, plus keeping the seasoning away from the meat until it hits the oven, so the bird stays nice and juicy. The butter will melt off as it cooks, adding to the flavour of the gravy, and you’ll also be able to skim off that tasty fat and save it in a jar in the fridge for delicious cooking another day., Generously sprinkle the turkey from all sides with sea salt and black pepper, pick over the remaining herb leaves and pat them on to the butter, then finely grate over a nice coating of nutmeg., Cover the turkey snugly with tin foil and place it on top of the trivet in the tray.

Pop a lid on and place on the lowest heat for 10 minutes to warm through., Warm the rest of the gravy in a separate pan, ready to use it for dunking later., Meanwhile, peel and finely shred the carrot, matchstick the apple, peel and finely slice the red onion, and pick and slice the mint leaves. Place it all in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of pickling liquid from your gherkin jar., Finely slice the gherkins, using a crinkle-cut knife if you’ve got one, and the chilli, add to the bowl, mix well, lightly season and put aside., Mix all the BBQ sauce ingredients together., Split and toast your buns, then spread the BBQ sauce inside them, top and bottom. Pile your pulled turkey on the bun bases, drizzle with a little gravy and top with some of that tasty slaw.

Meanwhile, pop the turkey, curry paste and yoghurt in a large mixing bowl, and toss to completely coat the meat., Next make your charred aubergine. Turn your gas hob on to high, then prick both the aubergines with a fork all over. Sit them directly on the flame., Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, turning every now and then. You want to get that nice charred flavour. (If you don’t have a gas hob, pop them under a hot grill for 5 to 10 minutes, turning every now and then.), Once charred all over, leave to cool for 5 minutes in a bowl covered with clingfilm., Once the aubergine has cooled, peel off the skin and mash up the flesh, chopping through it with a knife to turn it into a chunky dip., Pick the mint leaves, then finely chop. Peel and finely grate the garlic, then deseed and finely chop the chilli. Put it all into a small bowl, reserving half the chilli and chopped mint, along with 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil., Mix well, then stir half of this dressing into the mashed aubergine along with sea salt and black pepper, to taste. Set aside. Peel and cut the onion into wedges., Once the griddle is hot, spoon in the marinated turkey, and add the onion wedges, and cook for 10 minutes, or until charred and crispy, turning regularly., Meanwhile, chop the lettuce into wedges, and bash the seeds out of a pomegranate. Roughly chop a handful of pistachios, then set to one side., Heat the flatbreads in a frying pan set over a high heat until warmed through, then serve with a good dollop of aubergine and the charred turkey and onion., Top with a little extra yoghurt, the little gem wedges, pomegranate seeds, chopped pistachios and the remaining mint leaves and red chilli. Drizzle with the rest of the chilli dressing to finish."

meat","To start the dumplings, roughly chop the bacon and place in a large frying pan on a medium-low heat to crisp up while you wash, trim and finely slice the leeks., Stir them into the pan with 1 tablespoon of oil, then cook for 15 minutes, or until soft and sweet, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and leave to cool., Meanwhile, for the stew, peel the onions, trim the celery, then roughly chop both and place in a large, wide casserole pan on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil (or even better, use turkey dripping to intensify the flavours)., Add the herb sprigs and bay, and cook for 15 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, stirring regularly. Stir in the mustard and flour for 2 minutes, then gradually stir in the stock to make a nice thick sauce., Crumble in the leftover stuffing and turn the heat off. Scoop out and discard the herb sprigs and bay leaves, then shred the turkey or chicken meat, stir it into your stew, taste, and season to perfection., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Place the flours in a large bowl. Dice and add the butter, then use your thumbs and forefingers to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs., Make a well in the middle, pour in the buttermilk, then gradually mix into the crumbs, bringing them in from the outside. Stir in the cooled leeks and bacon until just combined, but don’t overwork it – we want the dough as light as possible., Gently roll it out on a clean flour-dusted surface until 2cm thick, then use a 5cm fluted cutter to stamp out as many round dumplings as you can, re-rolling and using up any offcuts – you should get at least 12 from this amount., Brush the dumplings with beaten egg, then sit them on top of the stew., Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the dumplings are risen and golden and the stew is blipping and bubbling away nicely. Delicious with simple steamed greens."

   tinned chickpeas (drained weight)","Finely grate the courgette, trim and finely chop the spring onions and green chilli, then chop the pistachios. Pick and finely chop all the fresh herbs., Toast the cumin seeds in a dry pan until smelling fantastic. Meanwhile, lightly beat the egg., Mix all the kofte ingredients together in a large bowl, keeping some pistachios back to garnish, then season well., With wet hands, form 16 kofte, each the size and shape of a small egg. Leave in the fridge to firm up for at least 30 minutes, then thread onto metal skewers, two kofte on each., Cook the kofte under a grill or over a flame charcoal grill, on high for 12 minutes, until juicy, golden brown and cooked through, turning regularly., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., To make the chilli sauce, halve the tomatoes and onions (there's no need to peel), and bash the unpeeled garlic cloves., Place the red chillies, tomatoes, onions and garlic on a baking tray. Drizzle with oil and season, then roast for 25 minutes or until soft and slightly blackened., Allow to cool slightly, then carefully remove and discard the stalks from the chillies, the cores from the tomatoes and the skins from the onions and garlic., Add to a food processor, along with the sugar, tomato purée and vinegar. Blitz until smooth and add a lug of oil to make it glossy. Pulse again, then season., For the tahini yoghurt, mix all the ingredients in a bowl and season with a pinch each of sea salt and black pepper., To make the pilav, peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Add a lug of oil to a non-stick pan over a medium-low heat, then sweat the onion and garlic for 10 minutes. Add the bulgur and stir to coat., Pour in the stock, bring it to the boil, then turn down the heat to very low. Cover with a lid and steam the bulgur for 8 minutes., Meanwhile, in a separate pan, melt the butter and cook the vermicelli until the butter turns golden brown., After 8 minutes, add it to the bulgur along with the chickpeas – don’t stir at any point, just replace the cloth and lid and let it steam for another 8 minutes., Turn off the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes – you should end up with a beautifully light and fluffy pilav., Serve the kofte accompanied by the pilav, chilli sauce and tahini yoghurt, then finish scattered with the reserved pistachios."

Using a 3cm circular cutter, cut a hole in the centre of each patty and pack in the sausage meat, pressing any excess turkey around the edges., Trim halve and finely shred the sprouts, then combine in a bowl with enough mayonnaise to bind them, season to taste, then set aside., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., Brush a griddle pan with oil, place it over a medium heat and cook the burgers for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until the juices run clear, then place in the oven for 5 minutes., Cut the buns in half and warm them under the grill., To assemble the burgers, spread the remaining mayonnaise on the bottom of each bun, sit a burger on top, spoon on a dollop of cranberry sauce and finish with the sprouts."

Either way, get your turkey out of the fridge 1 to 2 hours in advance, depending on its size, so it can come up to room temperature., Check the main cavity for the bag of giblets, and if they’re in there, remove them and tip into your roasting tray. The added flavour for your gravy later will be incredible – trust me., Warm the butter in your clean hands then rub and massage it all over the bird, getting into all the nooks and crannies, then sprinkle from a height with sea salt and black pepper., Halve the clementine and place in the main cavity with the fresh herbs – you don’t want to pack it full as you want to allow hot air to circulate., Use a handful (200g) of your favourite stuffing to fill the neck cavity, but don’t stuff it in too tightly, then pull the skin back over it and tuck it under the bird. You’ll get a good contrast between the soft, juicy stuffing here and the crispier stuff you can bake off in a dish., Roughly chop the veg – there’s no need to peel them – and chuck into the tray with the giblets to make your trivet, then sit the turkey on top and cover the tray with tin foil., Remember now to wash your hands, plus any kitchen kit the raw turkey has touched, before moving on., COOK – Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., As a guide, you want to cook a higher-welfare bird for 25 to 30 minutes per kilo, and a standard bird for 35 to 40 minutes per kilo. If you’ve got a 6kg bird, like I had here, do it for 2 hours 42 minutes – this sounds very precise, but I find that 27 minutes per kilo for a higher-welfare bird is the sweet spot., Remove the tin foil about 45 minutes before the end of cooking, to allow the turkey to get nice and golden., To check it’s cooked, the simplest way is to stick a knife into the thickest part of the thigh – if the juices run clear, it’s done. If you’re worried, you could also use a meat thermometer. You want to reach an internal temperature of 65ºC for a top-quality bird, such as Paul Kelly’s turkeys, or 70ºC for a supermarket higher-welfare or standard bird., Use heavy-duty tongs to lift up your bird so all the juices run from the cavity into the tray, then transfer the turkey to a platter, cover it with a double layer of tin foil and a clean tea towel, and leave to rest for up to 2 hours while you crack on with everything else., See how to finish your gravy by checking out my Christmas Day gravy recipe., CARVE – Choose from the two methods below, or watch the How to carve a turkey video on Food Tube., Remove the wing, slice the skin beside the leg, then pull out and chop the legs off. You can either slice or pull this brown meat – it’s so tasty. Keep it warm while you move on to the breast meat. Use the full length of the knife in a nice smooth action to slice through the breast meat, transferring it to a platter as you go., Remove the leg as above, then feel where the backbone is and cut with the length of your knife all the way down beside it until you hit the carcass. You can then lift the whole breast off the bone. Remove to a board and slice."

Peel and finely grate the ginger., Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat, then add the onion, garlic, carrot, ginger and dried chilli. Pop the lid on and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are soft, cooked through and lightly golden., Add the butternut squash, tomato purée and curry paste, then shred in the turkey, and stir well, making sure everything is well coated. Add the chopped tomatoes and season with sea salt and black pepper., Pour in the hot stock and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Now add the basmati rice and simmer for a further 10 minutes, until the rice is cooked. Season to taste, serve in big bowls and pick over the coriander leaves to garnish."

onions, then place in a frying pan with 1 tablespoon of oil and cook gently over a medium heat for 30 minutes, or until dark, sweet and sticky., Pick and finely chop the sage leaves, then roughly chop the bacon and add both to the pan after 10 minutes. Once cooked, add the onion mixture to a large bowl and leave to cool., Shred the turkey and add to the bowl, then finely grate over half the nutmeg. Add the remaining filling ingredients and mix together well., To make the pastry, place the flour into a large bowl. Put the dripping and 300ml of water in a small pan over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until melted. Bring to the boil, then stir straight into the flour. Leave until warm and pliable, but cool enough to handle., Knead the pastry until smooth, then cut off a quarter, wrap it in clingfilm and reserve for the top of your pie., Working quickly, while the dough is still pliable, press it evenly over the base and up the sides of a 23cm loose-bottomed cake tin, until it’s about 1cm thick, patching up any holes as you go – you may not need all of the pastry., Place the tin on a baking tray and fill the pastry case with the cooled filling, then roll out the reserved pastry and place it on top, pinching the edges to seal and create a crust. Gently press down the top of the pie to create a slight indent to hold the cranberry topping., Using the handle of a wooden spoon, carefully pierce a hole in the centre of the pie lid to allow the steam to escape, then bake the pie for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 160ºC/325ºF/gas 3 and cook for a further 2 hours 30 minutes., Carefully remove the pie from the oven, brush the top with beaten egg and pop it back in the oven for another 20 minutes, or until perfectly golden, then leave the pie to cool completely., To make the gravy, soak the gelatine in cold water for 5 minutes, then remove and squeeze out the excess water. In a pan, bring the stock almost to the boil, then remove from the heat and whisk in the gelatine. Leave to cool to room temperature., Using a small funnel, pour the gravy into the pie through the hole in the top, adding just a little at a time and allowing each addition to sink in before adding the next., To make the cranberry topping, place all the cranberries in a pan. Using a speed-peeler, strip in the orange zest, then squeeze in the all juice. Add the remaining topping ingredients, except for the sage, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thickened, stirring regularly., Taste and add a little extra sugar, if needed, then remove the cinnamon stick, cloves and orange peel. Leave to cool and thicken for 45 minutes, then spoon it on top of the pie. Place in the fridge overnight to set., Just before serving, pick the sage leaves, and fry over a medium-high heat until crispy, then scatter over the pie."

Shred up the leftover ham or turkey., Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet., Heat a little oil in a large pan, add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, until golden. Add the thyme, mushrooms, sea salt and black pepper and fry for 5 to 8 minutes., Stir in the ham or turkey, and continue to cook for 5 minutes, so everything gets some colour. Stir in the crème fraîche and remove the pan from the heat. Drain the pasta once cooked – saving a mugful of the cooking water – and let it cool slightly. Toss the pasta with a little oil, then stir into the sauce. Add a little cooking water to loosen, if needed., Stir in the spinach, add a good grating of Parmesan, squeeze in the lemon juice, then season to taste before serving."

boiling water, crush the allspice berries, zest and juice the orange, finely grate half the nutmeg, pick the thyme leaves and roughly chop the bay. Combine these and all the remaining marinade ingredients in a bowl or dish that’s large enough to hold the turkey., Place the turkey in the dish and rub the marinade all over. Cover with clingfilm. If you don’t have a large enough container, transfer the turkey to a large plastic bag and pour the marinade over it. Refrigerate to marinate overnight., For the spicy cornbread, preheat the oven to 220ºC/gas 7. Line the base and sides of a 24cm x 24cm baking dish with greaseproof paper and grease the paper. Peel and chop the onion, drain the sweetcorn, deseed and finely chop the Scotch bonnet, then melt the butter. Heat the oil in a pan, add the onion and cook over a medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes until softened. Transfer to a bowl, allow to cool, then add the corn and chilli., In a separate bowl, combine the flour, polenta, baking powder, sugar and 1 teaspoon sea salt, then stir in the onions. Stir in the milk and melted butter until combined., Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and cut off any excess paper with scissors. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan. You can cook the bread the day before you eat and store in an airtight container., For the stuffing, peel and roughly chop the onion and garlic, deseed and finely chop the Scotch bonnet, skin and roughly chop the chorizo and roughly chop the spicy cornbread. Drain and roughly chop the peppers, pick and roughly chop the coriander leaves, pick the thyme leaves and roughly chop the bay. Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, scotch bonnet and chorizo and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool then mix in all the stuffing ingredients., For the rum butter, put all ingredients in a food processor and blitz until combined. Chill until ready to use., Preheat the oven to its highest temperature. Remove the turkey from the fridge and place on a large board (reserve the marinade for basting). Carefully pack as much of the stuffing into the neck cavity as you can fit. Take some small metal skewers and pierce the skin on either side to close the cavity and keep the stuffing in. Put the remaining stuffing in a lightly greased baking dish and set aside in the fridge., Halve the carrots lengthways, peel and slice the clementines, and halve the orange. Peel and cut the onions into wedges, and roughly chop the celery. Put the carrot, fruit, onion and celery in a large roasting tin then place the turkey on top. Rub the rum butter all over the turkey, season well, then brush with some marinade and place in the oven. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes at the highest heat then reduce the heat to 180ºC/gas 4, cover the turkey with foil and roast for 35 to 40 minutes per kilo, basting with the marinade every 30 minutes., Remove the foil during the last hour of cooking so the skin gets crisp, and baste more frequently. You can use a meat thermometer to check if it’s cooked – insert into the thickest part of the breast; the turkey is ready when it registers 72ºC. Add the tray of stuffing to the oven for the last 15 minutes of cooking time, and bake while the turkey rests (45 minutes in total)., Transfer the turkey to a board (reserve the pan juices), and brush off some of the blackened marinade to reveal the bronzed skin. Cover with 2 layers of foil and 2 tea towels and rest for at least 30 minutes., Chop the kale and boil in salted water for 5 minutes, till tender. Drain, reserving some of the water. Finely slice the chilli and peel and finely slice the garlic. Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat, add the chilli and garlic and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes. Add the kale, stir well then transfer to a serving bowl., Next, make the gravy. Remove the excess fat from the reserved pan juices, then place the pan on a medium heat and stir. Add the flour and stir for a few minutes then add the rum, tomato paste and a little of the kale’s cooking water. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes or until beginning to thicken. Strain into a jug., Transfer the turkey to a serving platter, and transfer the extra stuffing to the open cavity. Carry to the table, carve and serve slices with stuffing, kale, gravy. Delicious served with mashed potatoes."

Place a griddle pan over a high heat., Mix the cayenne pepper, paprika, white pepper and oregano with a good pinch of sea salt and a little oil, and rub all over the turkey breasts. Put the turkey in the pan, turn the heat to medium and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, turning halfway., Meanwhile, make the salad and dressing. Halve, destone and peel one of the avocados, then blitz in a blender with the yoghurt, lime juice, chilli, most of the coriander and a good drizzle of oil until you have a creamy dressing. Season to taste, add a splash of water to loosen, if needed, then set aside., Slice the corn tortilla into 1cm strips, place onto a baking tray and bake in the oven for a few minutes, until golden and crisp., When your turkey is almost cooked, add the bacon to the pan for the last few minutes to crisp up. Once done, transfer the turkey to a board to rest, then thinly slice., Cut the lettuces into wedges, then crudely toss in a bowl with the turkey and avocado dressing, then scatter over a board. Crumble over the bacon, add the tortilla strips, then use a spoon to scoop out little nuggets of the remaining avocado and add these., Peel and segment the grapefruit, then scatter over the board with the cress (if using), and the remaining coriander leaves. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over."

to come up to room
temperature., For the stuffing, peel and finely chop the onions, roughly chop the dried fruit and nuts, and pick the thyme leaves. Whiz the bread into breadcrumbs in a food processor., Heat a lug of oil in a large pan on a medium heat, then add the onion. Cook for around 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly. Add the allspice, dried fruit, nuts, thyme and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, then transfer to a large bowl and leave to cool completely., Once cool, add the pork mince and breadcrumbs to the bowl and scrunch everything together with clean hands. Reserve about half the stuffing for the turkey, then transfer the rest to a greased baking dish (approximately 20cm). Spread it out in an even layer, keeping it rough on top, then put aside., Preheat the oven to full whack. Rinse the turkey under the cold tap, then
pat it dry, inside and out, with kitchen paper., Peel and crush the garlic, finely grate the lemon zest, then pick and roughly chop the thyme and rosemary. In a small bowl, mix the soft butter, garlic, lemon zest, half the thyme and rosemary leaves and a good pinch of salt and pepper., Push your finger and thumb between the skin and the flesh around the main cavity to make a gap and use a spatula to push in the butter. Squash the skin back down and use your hands to smooth and spread the butter under the skin. Open up the neck cavity and pack in the reserved stuffing. Pull the skin over the cavity and tuck it under the bird., Drizzle the bird with oil and season with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then rub this into the meat. Cut the zested lemon in half and place in the empty cavity., Peel and roughly chop the onion, trim and roughly chop the celery and carrot, then place in a large roasting tray with the turkey on top. Cover with tin foil then place in the hot oven. Immediately reduce the temperature to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Cook for about 35 to 40 minutes per kilo – the 5kg bird in this recipe will take about 3 to 3½ hours., Check your turkey every 30 minutes or so – spoon over any juices from the
bottom of the tray to keep it juicy. After 2½ hours, remove the foil so the skin crisps up. Thirty minutes before the turkey is ready, mix the remaining herbs with oil and scatter over the bird. Halve and add the clementines to the tray and leave in for the remaining cooking time., To check the turkey is cooked, stick a small sharp knife into the fattest part
of the thigh. If the juices run clear and the meat pulls apart easily, it’s ready. If not, cook it for a bit longer then check again. Once done, transfer the turkey to a serving platter and turn the oven up to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Cover the turkey with tin foil and 2 clean tea towels to keep it warm. Leave to rest for about 30 minutes while you cook your veg, stuffing and gravy., For the roast potatoes and veg, peel the parsnips, scrub the potatoes and carrots, then peel and halve the shallots. Break the garlic bulb up into cloves. Parboil the baby carrots in a pan of boiling salted water on a high heat for 5 minutes. Drain them in a colander and leave to steam dry. Chop the potatoes into 2cm chunks and peel and halve the parsnips lengthways., Add the veg to 2 large roasting trays with the shallots. Crush the garlic cloves with the heel of your hand and pick the rosemary leaves. Add both
to the trays along with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Drizzle everything generously with oil and toss well to coat. Roast in the hot oven along with the stuffing for 30 to 40 minutes, or until cooked through., When the veg and stuffing are in the oven, warm the stock in a pan on a
medium heat. Skim most of the fat away from the roasting tray, then stir in the flour, using a wooden spoon to scrape up all the sticky bits from the bottom., Place on a medium heat and add the red wine. Once that has cooked away, pour in the stock, bring it all to the boil, then reduce to a medium heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until you get a good consistency., Carefully pour the gravy through a sieve into a serving jug, using a spoon to push all that goodness through. Discard anything left in the sieve. Carve your turkey in the kitchen or at the table, and serve with all the usual trimmings."

Trim, peel and halve the carrots, halve the fennel, discarding the core, and trim, wash and halve the leek. Add the veg to the pan with the chopped tomatoes, drained beans and chickpeas, 500ml water and the bay leaf. Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce to a simmer with the lid on for 45 minutes, or until the veg is tender., Using tongs, remove the veg to a blender (use a hand-held stick blender, if you prefer) or bowl. Blitz until smooth, then stir back into the pan. Remove the amount needed for your baby, then either blend to a purée, pulse, mash and/or finely chop depending on the stage your little one is at (for more information on stages of complementary feeding, click here). If it’s a bit too thick, add a little water to loosen, then serve., For adults and toddlers, pick out and discard the bay leaf, season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, then pick, finely chop and scatter over the parsley to finish. Delicious served with baked potatoes or rice."

Transfer to a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to cool for around 10 minutes., Halve the anchovies lengthways, then add to a bowl along with the capers, red wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. Scrape off and discard the blackened skin from the cooled chillies. Halve, deseed and finely slice them lengthways, then add to the bowl. Mix well., Mash the tuna in a pestle and mortar to a smooth, creamy paste. Stir in the mayo, a pinch of cayenne, a squeeze of lemon juice and roughly 1 tablespoon of the dressing from the anchovies and chillies. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if you think it needs it., Arrange the turkey slices on a large platter, then drizzle over the tuna-spiked mayo. Now it’s time to get retro – lay over the anchovy fillets in neat vertical lines, then place the chillies horizontally on top so you’ve created a pattern, a bit like a checkerboard! Sprinkle over the capers and the rocket and drizzle over the remaining dressing. Finish with a sprinkling of cayenne and a good grating of lemon zest, then tuck in."

need 190g leftover cooked turkey, preferably brown meat, Preheat the oven to 130ºC/250ºF/gas ½. Add a splash of olive oil to a large frying pan over a medium heat. Roughly shred and add the turkey (if you’ve got the skin, add that too) and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until warmed through. Grate in the lime zest and stir in the chilli sauce, then reduce the heat to low and cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes, or until crisp and slightly caramelised., Meanwhile, place the baguettes in the oven to warm through. Peel and add the garlic and most of the ginger to a pestle and mortar, then bash to a smooth paste with a pinch of salt and 2 to 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Muddle in the mayo and the juice from the lime, then pick in the coriander leaves and stir to combine. Set aside., To make the pickle, peel the carrot, then coarsely grate and add to a large bowl along with the cucumber and cabbage. Peel, finely chop and add the remaining ginger, then sprinkle over a pinch of salt and scrunch together with your hands to get rid of any excess liquid. Add 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, the soy and vinegar and toss well to combine., Open out the warm baguettes, spread the chicken liver paté onto one side of each, then pile over the turkey and pickled veg. Finish with a dollop of lime-spiked mayo, then finely chop and scatter over the chilli (if using) along with the reserved coriander leaves. Press down slightly on the baguettes to close, then cut the banh mi into chunks and tuck in."

Shred and add the turkey (I use both the brown and white meat) and fry for around 5 minutes, or until crispy. Roughly bash the nuts and seeds in a pestle and mortar, then add to the pan with the cranberries and honey. Season and cook for a further couple of minutes, or until sticky and caramelised., Meanwhile, trim the nice tops off the chicory, leaving them whole, then trim and finely slice the base. Place the chicory leaves onto a serving platter with the watercress and rocket. Drizzle over the warm clementine dressing, pile the sticky, caramelised turkey on top and spoon over the yoghurt., Halve the pomegranate, then hold one half cut-side down in your hand and bash the back with a spoon so the seeds fall over the salad. Serve and enjoy!"

Beat three eggs in a bowl, then place the breadcrumbs and flour into two separate bowls. Dip a turkey breast in the flour, then shake off any excess and dip into the egg and roll in the breadcrumbs until well coated. Place onto a tray, then repeat with the remaining turkey., Slice the cheese into thin slices, then place onto the turkey, using your hands to stick it down. Layer over the Parma ham, pushing it down so it sticks, then coat each turkey breast in the flour, dip in the egg and coat in the breadcrumbs once more, then set aside., Heat a good lug of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Add two turkey breasts and fry for 6 to 8 minutes, or until cooked through and golden, turning halfway. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining turkey. Meanwhile, fry the remaining eggs in a large non-stick frying pan for 2 to 3 minutes for runny eggs. Divide the turkey between your plates, layer over the eggs and drizzle a little truffle oil on top, if using. Finish with a grating of Parmesan and serve with a nice watercress salad, if you like."

Deseed and finely slice the chilli, then trim and finely slice the spring onions and peel and finely slice the garlic., Pick the coriander leaves and set aside for later, then finely slice the stalks. Put all the chopped veg and herb stalks into a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat with a couple of lugs of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Fry for around 5 minutes, or until soft, stirring regularly., Add the rice, lemon zest and juice and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until golden and warmed through., Meanwhile, toss the turkey in the barbecue sauce, then add to a medium frying pan over a medium-high heat and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until crispy and slightly caramelised., Warm the tortillas in a dry frying pan, then divide and pile equal amounts of the Cajun rice and turkey onto one side of each tortilla. Scatter over the reserved coriander leaves and crumble the feta on top., Roll them up, tucking in one side as you go, so you end up with four open-ended burritos. Serve with a dollop of yoghurt and a drizzle of chilli sauce on the side."
Christmas butter | Jamie Oliver recipes,"Cranberries, clementines & fresh herbs","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/29SaW1D3qqL8y-gtuaMATK.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '10']",In25 minutes,"“This butter is a job for Christmas Eve. It won’t take long and will guarantee you happiness the day after. A really beautiful turkey like Mr Kelly’s doesn't need anything more than olive oil and salt and pepper, they’re that good. While the purist in me says leave it alone, the chef in me is curious and wants to experiment. I think the bird, and the occasion, deserve a bit of extra love so if you can add a bit of an edge with something that complements and enhances its natural flavours, why not try it?

An experiment of mine I’m happy to say really worked out was this flavoured butter. It looks beautiful, gives a delicate sweetness and holds the skin away from the meat so it gets extra crispy as it cooks. Another bonus is that the butter’s journey out of the bird will give you a self-basting bird.

Really finely chop the cranberries and add to the bowl., Pick the thyme, rosemary and sage leaves, then chop, sweep and run your knife through the herb leaves until really finely chopped. Add to the butter with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Grate in the zest of your clementine and mix so the butter softens and everything is combined. Divide the butter roughly in half., Get your turkey and use a spoon to work your way between the skin and the meat. Start at the side of the cavity just above the leg and work gently up toward the breastbone and towards the back so you create a large cavity., Pick up half of your butter and push it into the cavity you’ve created. Use your hands to push it through the skin right to the back so it coats the breast meat as evenly as possible. Do the same on the other side, then rub any leftover butter all over the outside of the bird to use it up., If you've got any herb stalks left over, put them in the cavity of the turkey for added flavour as it cooks., Cover the turkey in clingfilm and put in the fridge until you’re ready to cook it the next day."

beaten","Dad and I had a really interesting conversation about smaller families not wanting whole turkeys for their dinner. So we had a scout around the supermarkets and developed a really delicious and impressive recipe for this. It’s dramatic and stretches the meat a fairly long way. The case of pastry and minced mushrooms keeps the breast moist and delicious and is a little forgiving so the meat holds its juices. You could assemble it a day before and just leave it in the fridge ready to over deliver on Christmas day., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Place the turkey breast upside-down on a board. Gently slice into the natural join of the breast muscle to open it out and make a sort of pocket. Season well and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle over half the thyme leaves, then spread over an even layer of cranberry jam, pushing it into all the nooks and crannies. Fold it back into shape to seal the mixture inside – swiss roll-stylie – and push a few cocktail sticks into the seam to keep it together. Transfer the turkey to a roasting tray, season the outside with the remaining thyme leaves, a good pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Rub it all over, cover in tin foil and roast in the hot oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until just cooked through – using a thermometer, you want it to be 72°C at the thickest point., Meanwhile, soak the porcini in a dish of just-boiled water. After 5 minutes, stir with a fork so any bits of grit sink to the bottom. Add the bacon to a large frying pan with a splash of oil on a medium heat and fry for 5 to 10 minutes, or until beautifully golden and super crispy. Strip in the leaves from 2 rosemary sprigs for the last 30 seconds or so. Remove everything from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat behind. Add the fresh mushrooms to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper. Drain and chop the porcini, saving the water, then stir into the pan. Add a splash of the water, avoiding the grit, then cook for around 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pan starts to sizzle again and the mushrooms are golden, soft and sticky with caramelly edges., To make the gravy, cut the thigh off the turkey leg and slash into it slightly. Throw the leg and thigh into a pot along with the carrot, leek and onion. Stir in the flour, add a good pinch of salt and pepper and 2 litres of boiling water. Add a heaped tablespoon of cranberry jam, the balsamic vinegar and remaining rosemary sprig. Bring back to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for around 2 hours, or until thick. Strain it through a sieve and reheat before serving., When the mushroom pan is dry, add a knob of butter and toss to coat.  Tip the mushrooms into the food processor and whiz until you get a good mixture of smooth and chunky. Leave to cool. Once the turkey breast and stuffing have cooled, you can get on with assembling the wellington., Dust a clean surface with flour, then roll out each packet of puff pastry to the size of a shoe box (one will be the base, one the lid – roll the lid ever so slightly bigger). Line a large roasting tray with greaseproof paper, dust with flour, then add the smaller piece of pastry. Spread half of the mushroom stuffing onto the middle of the base to cover an area the same size as your turkey breast. Remove the cocktail sticks, then place the turkey breast on top and spread the remaining stuffing over the top packing it all in and smoothing it out so that the whole breast is covered.  Sprinkle with the crispy bacon and rosemary, then brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg. Lay the second sheet of pastry over the top, gently mold it round the shape of the breast, pushing all the air out and seal together. Trim the edges  to around 4cm, then pull, twist, tuck and pinch in the pastry (like in the picture)., Brush the whole thing with beaten egg then all the hard work’s done. Leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight until you’re ready to cook. On Christmas day, cook at 180°/350°F/gas 4 for 50 to 60 minutes, or until risen, puffy and beautifully golden and the turkey is piping hot throughout. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for around 10 minutes before carving. Serve carved into 2.5cm with the gravy and all the usual. Christmas in a mouthful."

shredded., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Peel and roughly chop the onions and carrot, and trim and roughly chop the leek. Deseed and roughly chop the peppers, and deseed and finely chop the chillies., Heat a few lugs of olive oil in a large casserole-type pan on a medium heat. Add the onions, carrot, leek, peppers and chillies, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes., Pick the coriander leaves (save these for later) and finely chop the stalks., Add the coriander stalks, cumin and paprika to the pan, and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring frequently until soft and delicious. Sometimes I like to add some honey and white wine vinegar at this point and let it cook for a couple of minutes. I find this adds a wonderful sheen and enhances the natural sweetness of the vegetables., While that’s happening, shred the turkey meat off your carcass and roughly chop it. Add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper to the pan of vegetables, then add the turkey and take the pan off the heat., Scrunch in the tomatoes, drain and add the chickpeas or butter beans and stir everything together. Pop it in the hot oven to blip away for 2 hours. Check on it after an hour, and add a splash of water if it looks a bit dry., While that’s cooking, make your guacamole. Peel and destone the avocados and put one of them in a food processor. Halve the tomatoes, peel the onion and garlic, and deseed the chilli, and add it all to the food processor with the coriander and blitz., Use a fork to mash the other avocado in a bowl so it’s nice and chunky. Taste the mixture in the food processor and add salt and squeezes of lime juice until the taste is just right for you. Whiz up one more time, then tip into the bowl with your chunky avocado and mix together., Take the chilli out of the oven and scrape all the gnarly bits from the edge of the pan back into the chilli for added flavour. Squeeze in some lime juice, and stir through most of the reserved coriander leaves., Have a taste to check the seasoning, then serve with steamed basmati rice or tortillas, and a good dollop of soured cream and guacamole on top. Scatter over your remaining coriander leaves and some finely sliced fresh chilli if you fancy, then get everyone to tuck in!"

It’s not a pretty-boy pie; it’s a proper, old-school pie that everyone will be over the moon to see on the table. I’m putting leftover white turkey meat to good use here, but you could also mix brown meat in there too., Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Put your bacon in a large pan on a medium heat and add your thyme leaves. Add a lug of olive oil and let it all fry off a few minutes. Add all of your prepped leeks and fry them off for about 3 minutes. Add a pinch of salt and pepper then pop the lid on top, turn the heat down to medium and let them cook away gently for 30 minutes, stirring every 5 to 10 minutes to make sure they don’t catch. There’s going to be enough moisture in the leeks to keep them happy in the pan so they should be soft and melt in your mouth once they’re done., When your leeks are ready, add the turkey meat to them and stir. If you’ve got a bit of stuffing mixed in there you can put that in too. Add the flour, mix it in well then pour in your stock and stir again. Add the crème fraîche then turn the heat up and bring everything back up to the boil. Have a taste and add a bit more salt and pepper if it needs it then turn the heat off. Pour the mixture through a sieve over another large empty pan and let the wonderful gravy from the mixture drip into the pan while you roll out your pastry., Get a deep baking dish roughly 22 x 30cm. Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with a bit of flour and roll your pastry out so it’s about double the size of your dish. Crumble the chestnuts over one half of the pastry then tear a few of the sage leaves over the chestnuts. Fold the other half of pastry on top then roll it out carefully and evenly so you have a rectangle big enough to cover your baking tray. Don’t worry if a few bits stick out here and there., Spoon that thick leek mixture from your sieve into the pie dish and spread it out evenly. Lay your pastry on top, tuck the ends under then gently score the pastry diagonally with your knife. Add a pinch of salt to your beaten egg then paint this egg wash over the top of your pastry. Pop your pie in the oven for about 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is puffed up and golden brown.  When the pie is ready, re-heat the lovely gravy and serve with your pie, along with some peas tossed in butter, lemon, salt and pepper and everyone’s happy!"

If you’re buying from a small producer, like the lovely turkey I used from my mate Paul Kelly, you’ll often find these birds come with their own cooking instructions. Really good-quality birds do cook in a shorter time so follow the instructions if it has them., This year I’m using a flavoured butter to give a bit of extra love to my turkey, and this is a job you can do the day before. Get your turkey and use a spoon to work your way between the skin and the meat. Start at the side of the cavity just above the leg and work gently up towards the breastbone and towards the back so you create a large cavity. Pick up half of your butter and push it into the cavity you’ve created. Use your hands to push it through the skin right to the back so it coats the breast meat as evenly as possible. Do the same on the other side then rub any leftover butter all over the outside of the bird to use it up. If you’ve got any herb stalks left over, put them in the cavity of the turkey for added flavour as it cooks. Cover the turkey in cling film and keep in the fridge until you need it., Take your turkey out of the fridge a few hours before you are ready to put it in the oven so it has time to come up to room temperature. That flavoured butter will already be under the skin so you’ll only need a few tweaks to finish it off. Halve the clementines and pop them in the cavity with a few more sprigs of fresh herbs like rosemary, bay and thyme. The fruit will steam and flavour the birds in a really lovely way. Take the fresh rosemary, pull off the leaves at the bottom then spear that through the loose skin around the cavity to hold it together and keep it from shrinking back as the turkey cooks., Open up the neck cavity and pack as much stuffing  as possible in there, then carefully pull the skin back over the cavity, tuck it under the bird and pop it in the roasting tray. If you’ve already made your gravy like I’ve done, you won’t need a vegetable trivet, if not, do that now by roughly chopping the carrots, onions and celery sticks. Preheat your oven to full whack, get the turkey in the roasting tray and cover with foil. As soon as it goes in the oven, immediately turn the heat down to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., As a rough guide, you want to cook the turkey for about 35 to 40 minutes per kilogram, so a 7kg turkey will want about 4 to 4½ hours in the oven. But there are so many variables such as the sort of oven you have and the quality of your bird. Check on your turkey every 30 minutes or so and keep it from drying out by basting it with the lovely juices from the bottom of the pan. After 3½ hours, remove the foil so the skin gets golden and crispy. If you are at all worried just stick a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the breast. When the internal temperature has reached 65ºC for a good quality bird, and about 82ºC for a cheaper bird, it’s ready to come out., Carefully put a metal skewer in the cavity and use it to lift the bird and angle it over the roasting tray so all of the juices from the cavity run out. Move the turkey to a platter then cover it with a double layer of tinfoil and 2 tea towels to keep it warm while it rests for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours for bigger birds."

Heat a saucepan until medium hot and add a splash of olive oil. Pick the sage leaves and add to the pan with 6 of the pancetta or bacon strips., Peel and chop 2 garlic cloves and 1 onion. Trim and chop the celery and add to the pan with the garlic and onion. Fry everything gently until soft and golden brown. Take the pan off the heat, add the breadcrumbs and, while the mix is cooling down, roughly chop the apricots and stir them in., When the stuffing has cooled down, add the pork, lemon zest, nutmeg, egg and lots of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, and mix everything together well.

Slice the remaining strips of pancetta or bacon in half and peel and slice 1 peeled garlic clove into thin slivers. Place a rosemary sprig and a garlic sliver on one end of a halved strip of pancetta and roll it up tightly. Repeat with the other pieces of pancetta until you have 12 little rolls., Stab the thighs and drumsticks of the turkey in 6 places on each side. Push a little pancetta roll into each hole until it just peeps out. This will give your turkey thighs a fantastic flavour and will keep them moist while they cook., Peel the remaining onions and chop in half, and peel and thickly slice the carrots., Give your turkey a good wipe, inside and out, with kitchen paper, and place it on a board, with the neck end towards you. Find the edge of the skin that's covering the turkey's breasts and gently peel it back. Work your fingers and then your hand under the skin, freeing it from the meat. If you're careful you should be able to pull all the skin away from the meat, keeping it attached at the sides. Go slowly and try not to make any holes!, Lift the loose skin at the neck end and spoon the stuffing between the skin and the breast, tucking the flap of skin underneath to stop anything leaking out. Pop the orange in the microwave for 30 seconds to warm it up and stuff it into the cavity., Weigh the stuffed turkey and calculate the cooking time (about 20 minutes per 500g/1lb 2oz)., Place the bird on a large roasting tray, rub it all over with olive oil and season well. Surround with the chopped carrots, onions and remaining cloves of garlic, cover with tin foil and place in the preheated oven. Turn the heat down right away to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 and roast for the calculated time, or until the juices run clear from the thigh if you pierce it with a knife or a skewer. Remove the tin foil for the last 45 minutes to brown the bird., Carefully lift the turkey out of the tray and rest on a board covered loosely with foil for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours for bigger birds., When the resting time's nearly up, skim off the surface fat from the roasting tray and add the flour and stock. Place the tray on the hob and bring to the boil on a high heat. When the gravy starts to thicken, strain it into a bowl., Carve your turkey, serve with the gravy and dig in!"

This recipe is nice and simple and will help you achieve brilliant results for your Christmas meal., Take your turkey out of the fridge about an hour before you’re ready to cook it so it comes up to room temperature before roasting. Give it a good rinse then pat it dry with some kitchen paper, making sure you soak up any water in the cavity. Drizzle the meat with a good lug of olive oil, add a few good sprinkles of salt and pepper and then rub this seasoning all over the bird, making sure you get in to all the nooks and crannies., Preheat your oven to full whack then get started on your stuffing. Pour a lug or two of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat and fry off your chopped onion for about 10 minutes or until softened. Stir in a good pinch of salt and pepper, the ground nutmeg and your chopped sage leaves, then continue to fry and stir for another minute or two., Spoon the onion mixture into a large bowl and let it cool completely. Once cooled, add your pork mince and breadcrumbs and use your hands to really scrunch everything together. Once it’s mixed really well, bring the stuffing together into a ball, then cover and chill until you’re ready to stuff your turkey., Pull the skin at the neck-end back so you can see a cavity and push about half of your stuffing inside your turkey. Not too much: you don’t want to pack it so tightly it slows down the cooking. Once done, pull and fold the skin over the opening and tuck it under the bird so it looks nice., Turn the turkey around and drop a few small pieces of stuffing into the larger cavity along with your clementine halves and a few sprigs of rosemary. Place your roughly chopped veg in the bottom of a roasting pan and lay your turkey on top. Cover the turkey with tin foil then put it in the hot oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Cook for about 35 to 40 minutes per kilo. The 5kg bird in this recipe will take about 3 to 3½ hours., Check on your turkey every 20 minutes or so and keep it from drying out by basting it with the lovely juices from the bottom of the pan. After 2½ hours, remove the foil so the skin gets golden and crispy., When the time is up, take your turkey out of the oven and stick a small sharp knife into the fattest part of the thigh. If the juices run clear and the meat pulls apart easily, it’s ready. If not, pop the turkey back in the oven to cook for a bit longer then check again. When you're confident it's cooked, rest the turkey for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours for bigger birds. Meanwhile you can get your veg and gravy ready."

nuts, dried cranberries and Chinese five-spice, give it all a good stir, then let it toast away while you get on with your salad, shaking the pan occasionally to stop it from catching., Pick the mint and most of the coriander leaves into a bowl, then add the salad leaves and toss together., For the dressing, peel, finely grate and add the onion to a small bowl., Squeeze in the clementine and lime juice, then halve the pomegranate and squeeze half through your fingers to catch any seeds. Pour in three times as much extra virgin olive oil., Add the soy sauce and sesame oil. Peel and coarsely grate the ginger, then squeeze all the juice into the bowl, discarding the pulp., Give the dressing a good stir, and have a taste – if you want a little more salt, add a splash more soy. If you want more acid, add another squeeze of lime juice., Drizzle over enough dressing to coat the salad leaves, then use your hands to toss and dress them. Deseed and finely chop the chilli., Drizzle the honey into the pan with the turkey meat and stir through until coated. Turn the heat up to full whack for the last few seconds to really crisp up the meat mixture., At this point, make sure your guests are all at the table and ready to eat so you can serve the salad as soon as the hot meat hits the salad leaves. Toss half of the pan-fried ingredients through the salad leaves and transfer to a serving platter., Spoon the remaining nuts, cranberries and crispy meat over the top of the salad and add another drizzle of dressing., Hold the remaining pomegranate half over the salad and gently smack it with a wooden spoon so that the seeds tumble out over the salad., Garnish with a nice sprinkling of fresh red chilli, and the remaining coriander leaves and serve right away."
