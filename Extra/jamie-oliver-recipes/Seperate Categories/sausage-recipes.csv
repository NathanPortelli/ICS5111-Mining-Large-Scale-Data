Cook for 8 minutes, or until the sausage has crisped up., Remove the lid and coarsely grate over half the cheese, then use a fish slice to confidently flip the bagel., Grate the remaining cheese onto the sausage, pop the lid back on the pan and cook covered on a low heat for 4 more minutes, or until the cheese has melted. Serve with tomato ketchup and/or brown sauce."

Tear in the sage leaves (keep the stalks for the trivet later) and grate in half of the nutmeg. When the sage is brown, add the onions and cook for 15 minutes, until golden and sweet. Don’t rush this part, this is where you amplify the flavour., Now let’s ramp up the Christmassy flavours: tip in the cranberries, and crumble in the chestnuts. Thinly slice the dried apples and add to the pan with a big pinch of salt and black pepper., Finely grate in the zest of both the clementines (save one for step 8 and the other for your turkey trivet) and pour in the cider. Let the cider bubble away until lovely and shiny, then leave to cool completely., Tear the stale bread into small chunks, place in a food processor and blitz into breadcrumbs (you might need to do this in batches). Tip into a baking tray or dish and add the onion mixture. Use clean hands to really scrunch and mix everything together., Take half of the stuffing and press it into an oiled bundt tin or baking dish., Add the sausagemeat to the remaining stuffing and use your hands to scrunch everything together. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, then scrunch it all up until well combined. Take a third of the stuffing and place it in a pretty baking dish. Cut one of the zested clementines in half and push, skin-side down into the centre of the stuffing. (Use the remaining stuffing to stuff your turkey)., Pop both dishes in the oven to cook for 50 minutes, or until bubbling and crispy. If you’re doing it as part of your Christmas lunch, you want to put it in at the same time as your spuds., Once done, you can pour away any excess fat before serving, if you like. It will be soft, juicy and succulent on the inside, then gnarly, crispy and chewy on the outside. Enjoy!"

Squeeze over the juice from ½ a lime, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and add a small pinch of black pepper., Halve 1 brioche-style burger bun, push the mushrooms to one side and toast the bun in the pan until golden., Spread the bun base with the chilli sauce (if using) and top with the sausage patty and mushrooms., Crack 1 egg into a bowl and beat with a fork.

Grate over 15g of Red Leicester or Cheddar cheese, then remove the pan from the heat and use a spatula to carefully flick in the sides of the egg until it's all folded into a perfectly silky omelette., Place the omelette on top of the mushrooms, lay over the sliced avocado and drizzle with more chilli sauce, if you like.

Peel the prawns (keeping the tails on), throwing the heads and shells into the stock pan as you go. Run the tip of a knife down the backs of the prawns and pull out and discard the dark veins, then score a little deeper so they butterfly as they cook., Slice the sausage into rough chunks, place in a large casserole pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then cook for 10 minutes, or until it has released its tasty fat., Turn down the heat to low, then remove the sausage to a plate, leaving the fat behind in the pan. Stir the butter and flour into the pan, really scraping up all the sticky bits from the bottom. Continue stirring for 15 to 20 minutes (be patient!), or until dark golden brown – think peanut butter, but you can take it even darker, if you prefer (see tip). You want the roux to have a semi-loose, doughy consistency, so add a splash of oil if there isn’t a lot of fat., Deseed the peppers, peel the onion and roughly chop with the celery, then stir into the roux pan (this is called the holy trinity). Scrunch and add the bay leaves and strip in the thyme leaves, then peel, finely chop and add the garlic, followed by the cayenne and Tabasco., Put the sausage back into the pan, then scrunch in the tomatoes using clean hands, stirring as you go. Ladle the stock through a sieve into the pan, then let it blip away for 10 minutes., Trim the green beans, slice each into three pieces, then add to the pan and cook for 6 minutes. Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley., Slice the sea bass fillets lengthways into thin strips, then halve the langoustines and crack the claws (if using). Sort through the cockles or clams and tap them – if any stay open, throw them away., Add all the fish and seafood to the pan and simmer for a few minutes, or until perfectly cooked – the prawns should be pink and the clams or cockles open (discard any that remain closed), stirring regularly., Squeeze over lemon juice to taste, and scatter with the chopped parsley.

pour over the boiling water and leave to soak overnight., The following day, make the spice paste. Peel the onion half, then place it in a dry pan over a medium-low heat with the unpeeled cloves of garlic and char for 15 to 20 minutes, or until soft and slightly browned, stirring occasionally. Add the oregano and toast, stirring, for 2 minutes, then remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly., Tip everything from the pan into a food processor, squeezing the cloves of garlic out of their skins (discard these) first, then add the remaining paste ingredients and blitz until smooth., Preheat the oven to 130°C/250°F/gas ½. For the filling, peel and finely slice the red onion, then place into a large casserole pan with the haggis, ribs, black pudding and shoulder of pork. Rub everything with the spice paste, until completely covered, then pour in the stock. Cover with greaseproof paper and foil and cook in the oven for 8 hours, or until tender., To make the tacos, put the flour into a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt and make a well in the middle. Measure out 700ml of boiling kettle water in a jug. Pour into the well, then use a fork to gradually mix the flour into the water, until it starts to come together. Bring into a smooth dough and rest for 20 minutes., Divide into 36 equal pieces. Roll into balls, covering with a clean damp tea towel as you go to prevent the dough from drying out. Tear off a large sheet of greaseproof paper, fold it in half, place one ball in the middle, and roll out between the paper until about 1mm thick. Cook in a dry non-stick pan on a medium-high heat until starting to curl at the edges, then flip and cook on the other side, rolling out your next ball while it cooks. Stack up in a clean tea towel so they stay warm., To make the red onion ceviche, peel and finely chop the red onions. Tip into a small bowl and cover with the juice of the oranges and limes, then set aside., Thinly slice the avocados and place on a plate with a pinch of sea salt and squeeze of lemon juice. Pick over the coriander leaves, then set aside., To make the salsa, char the jalapeños, tomatoes and the unpeeled cloves of garlic in a large dry frying pan over a medium heat for 5 minutes, until blistered, but not burst. Remove the stalks from the jalapeños, peel the garlic, then bash them to a paste in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of salt. Add the charred tomatoes, along with the juice of 2 limes and 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and tear in the mint leaves, then muddle together to make a salsa., When the meat is cooked, shred it, discarding the bones and the metal fastening of the haggis, transfer to a large platter, then take everything to the table for everyone to load up their own tacos."

First, we have the classic sausage roll, using shop-bought sausages for a perfectly seasoned filling, then we have a veggie cheese roll, packed with a beautiful flavour combo that makes the squash really come to life.

leaves","Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Bash the cinnamon stick, coriander seeds and chilli flakes in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of black pepper until fine., Scrub and cut the squash in half lengthways then remove the seeds (see tip below). Cut each half into four, then transfer to a baking tray and drizzle over 2 tablespoons of olive oil, sprinkle with the seasoning and roast in the oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until soft and sweet., Remove the tray from the oven (leave the oven on) and set aside half of the roasted squash to use another day (see tips below). Use a fork to mash the remaining squash (skin and all) in the tray, then crumble over the chestnuts and sprinkle with the cranberries. Grate over 30g of the Cheddar cheese and mix together., Unroll the puff pastry onto a flour-dusted surface, cut each piece in half lengthways (so you have 4 long pieces), then spoon the squash mixture along one piece of pastry and shape down the middle., Cut a slit along each sausage and squeeze the sausage meat out of the skins along the length of two pieces of the pastry, then shape down the middle (leaving you with one piece for the plait). Beat the egg with the mustard in a small bowl and brush over the exposed pastry, then fold it over the fillings and gently press out any air with your thumb., Trim the edges and use a flour-dipped fork to crimp and seal them, then cut one sausage roll into 8 and the other sausage roll into 16. Cut the squash and Cheddar roll into 16., Line 2 large baking trays with baking paper. Place a small bowl upside down in the centre of one of the trays and arrange the larger sausage rolls around it, leaving space in between each one. Then use the smaller sausage rolls to fill the gaps (as per the picture above). Remove the bowl and place the squash rolls in the centre. Any remaining rolls can be frozen for another time (see tip). Brush all the pastry with the remaining egg wash and sprinkle with the sesame and poppy seeds. Rub the rosemary sprigs and bay leaves with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil, then stick into the pastry around the wreath., To make the plait, cut the remaining pastry in half lengthways. Place the tip of the knife near the top of the pastry and cut each half into three lengthways, making sure it remains connected at the top. Grate over the rest of the Cheddar (50g) and then weave into two plaits. Pinch the ends together to join them up into one long plait and form into a circle, patting any cheese that falls off back onto the pastry. Place on the lined baking tray, then transfer both trays to the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes until golden, crisp and bubbling. Lay the plait above the wreath and decorate with ribbon or baubles, if you like, before serving."

Tear in most of the sage leaves, then add the onions, the clementine zest, a good grating of nutmeg and a pinch of black pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and fry for 5 to 10 minutes, until the onions start to soften., Meanwhile, trim the livers, if using, remove any sinews and roughly chop with the apricots, then stir into the pan. Once the time’s up on the onions, pour in the Vin Santo, turn up the heat to medium-high and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and the alcohol has cooked away. Leave to cool completely., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Whiz the stale bread to crumbs in a food processor then stir into the pan along with the sausage meat., Use your hands to squash and squidge everything until well combined. Put half of the stuffing mixture (around 500g) aside to stuff the neck and legs of your turkey, then pack the rest into an oiled baking dish (15cm x 20cm). Flatten the stuffing down and use your hands to almost tuck the edges into the dish to create a mound in the middle., Scatter over the reserved sage leaves and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil then bake for 50 minutes, or until cooked through, golden and bubbling."

Roll and stretch out into a large oval (about 15cm x 30cm), then place in a large sturdy oiled tray., Cover with a clean damp tea towel and leave to rest while you put a small non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat, then squeeze balls of sausagemeat out of the skins into the pan (if using veggie sausages, roughly slice and use 1 tablespoon of olive oil for frying). Fry until golden all over, tossing regularly, while you peel the red onion and slice super finely, ideally on a mandolin (use the guard!)., Pick the rosemary leaves and toss with the onion, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and 1 tablespoon of oil until well coated., Spread the tomato paste over the dough, sprinkle over the dressed red onion, and spoon over the sausage balls., Toss the grapes into the pan for 1 minute, then spoon over the pizza with any juices, tear over the mozzarella and sprinkle with the pine nuts., Place the tray over a high heat on the hob until it starts to sizzle, then cook at the bottom of the oven for 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp."

Put a large non-stick, ovenproof frying pan on a medium-high heat., Squeeze the sausage meat out of the skins directly into the frying pan, with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil. Use a wooden spoon to roughly break up the meat., Add the oregano and fennel seeds (if using), and stir-fry until the sausage meat is lightly golden., Peel and finely slice the onions then add to the pan with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Add the jalapeños and a splash of their vinegar. Cook on a medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the onions are soft and caramelised, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, for the dough, pile the flour into a bowl with a good pinch of sea salt. Add up to 250ml of water, mixing until it comes together as a smooth, elastic dough. You want it to be pliable., Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for a couple of minutes, then form into a rough round., Now, tip your topping out of the pan for a moment, returning the pan to a medium heat. Place the dough in the pan and – being careful not to touch the hot pan – use your fingertips to stretch out the dough to cover the base., Spoon the topping back over the pizza, spreading it out and pushing the sausage into the dough, then grate over the cheese., Turn the heat back up to medium-high and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the base has started to crisp up.

Mash everything up with your spoon, reduce to low and leave to cook for 2 to 3 hours, or until thick, glossy and reduced., About 15 minutes before you’re ready to serve, cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water., Add the pasta to the sauce, stir in some of the reserved pasta water to help the sauce stick and mix well over the heat., Use tongs to divide between your bowls, then serve with a good grating of Parmesan cheese."

To the pre-shaving days of being an under-age drinker down the Wagon and Horses in Saffron Walden with a fake ID and all my village mates. Only once in a while of course. But seriously, without trying to sound like a lagered-up geezer, I think everyone’s experienced the need for food around midnight, whether the binge was small or large, otherwise why would kebab shops be so popular in Britain? Anyway, I always used to have three or four friends back to my house for munchies or to stay the night and this dish was devised so we didn’t have too much trouble making it or too much washing up to do. In actual fact, I only had to wipe the non-stick pan clean. It also makes its way from the pan to the plate quite quickly, as patience isn’t a virtue at that time of night with my mates! ”",,,,,,,,,"mushrooms, higher-welfare smoked or unsmoked bacon, ripe tomatoes, higher-welfare sausages, large free-range eggs, olive oil, crusty bread                                                                                                                                                                , preferably sourdough","First of all, get the biggest non-stick pan available, and preheat it on a high heat while you gather your ingredients. Obviously you wouldn’t be organised at this point so it’s a matter of using what you’ve got, but ideally I like to have mushrooms, bacon, tomatoes, sausages and eggs., By the time you have got these together the pan will be hot, so slice your sausages in half lengthways and pat them out flat so they cook quickly. Place in the pan at one side., On the other side of the pan, put a tiny lug of oil and place a pile of mushrooms over it which you can rip up or leave whole., Shake the pan about a bit to coat the mushrooms and season with some sea salt and black pepper. Push to one side, then lay some slices of bacon and halved tomatoes in the pan., Cook for a couple more minutes until the bacon is crisp and golden. Shake the pan and turn the bacon over. Now is the time to put a round of toast into the toaster., At this stage you should respect the rustic and authentic look and shuffle everything about so that it’s all mixed together and add 2 or 3 eggs at different ends of the pan. The whites of the eggs will dribble in and around the sausages, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms., Turn the heat down a little and continue to cook for another minute before placing the pan under the grill and finishing the eggs to your liking., Using a non-stick pan I’ve always found the removal of this dish to the plate extremely easy – it will resemble a frisbee and will slide on to your plate with no trouble at all. Doesn’t that sound appetising? But honestly, it really is a gem."

differ for all of us. I’ve given you the recipe for the pigs in blankets and the batter, and everything else is based on what you’ve got – just don’t overload it., Start by moving your oven shelves around so you have plenty of space in the middle of the oven for your Yorkshire to grow., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7., For the Yorkshire, beat the eggs into the flour with a pinch of sea salt, then gradually whisk in the milk to give you a smooth batter, and pour into a jug., Wrap half a rasher of bacon around each sausage, poking in a sage leaf, too. Pop on to a baking tray with the potatoes (roughly chop, if you like), balls or pinches of stuffing, and the sprouts., Pick over the rosemary leaves and place in the top of the oven for 10 minutes., Pour the sunflower oil into a baking dish (25cm x 30cm) and place in the oven on the shelf underneath, to preheat the oil properly., Meanwhile, for the gravy, wash, trim and finely slice the leek, then put it into a frying pan on a medium heat with the butter or dripping. Cook for 10 minutes, or until soft, stirring occasionally., Shred in the turkey meat and stir in the flour and cranberry sauce, followed by the stock., Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thick, then taste and season to perfection., For the next bit, you need to be cool, calm and safe, as you’re working with hot oil, and you want to retain the heat from the oven., Have your jug of batter ready and two oven gloves or tea towels.

Roughly chop all the vegetables, then blitz in the food processor with the chillies (stalks removed). Add the sausages, 1 heaped teaspoon of fennel seeds and 1 teaspoon of oregano. Keep pulsing until well mixed, then spoon this mixture into a large frying pan on a high heat with a lug of olive oil, breaking it up and stirring as you go. Keep checking on it and stirring while you get on with other jobs., Fill a large deep saucepan with boiling water. Season well then add the penne and cook according to packet instructions, with the lid askew., Crush 4 unpeeled cloves of garlic into the sausage mixture and stir in 4 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and the tinned tomatoes. Add a little of the starchy cooking water from the pasta to loosen if needed., Drain the pasta, reserving about a wineglass worth of the cooking water. Tip the pasta into the pan of sauce and give it a gentle stir, adding enough of the cooking water to bring it to a silky consistency.

Put a large, high-sided pan on a medium heat and toast the hazelnuts as it heats up., Meanwhile, peel the onion, trim the fennel and finely chop both., Tip the hazelnuts into a pestle and mortar, returning the pan to the heat. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 knob of butter, followed by the chopped veg, then strip in the thyme leaves (reserving the soft tips for garnish)., Squeeze the sausagemeat out of the skins into the pan, breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, then stir in the rice to toast., After 2 minutes, pour in the wine and stir until absorbed., Now start adding the stock, a ladleful at a time, letting each one cook away before adding more, and stirring constantly for 16 to 18 minutes, or until the rice is cooked but still retains its shape., When done, add a splash of stock or water to make it oozy, then finely grate over most of the Parmesan, beat it in with the remaining butter, taste, and season to perfection., Turn the heat off, then bomb in little nuggets of fontina, so they melt subtly into the rice., Cover, and leave to rest off the heat for 2 minutes while you crush the nuts., Divide the risotto between warm plates, then finely grate over the remaining Parmesan., Sprinkle over the crushed nuts and thyme tips, then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil."

Drizzle a little oil into a frying pan over a medium heat and sauté the onion, stirring occasionally, until completely translucent. Stir in the garlic and cook until golden, then remove from the heat and allow to cool., Squeeze the sausagemeat from the skins into a large bowl. Roughly chop the sage leaves and apricots, and stir into the sausagemeat along with the breadcrumbs and cooled onion mixture. Use your hands to bring it all together., Lay the turkey breast on a clean chopping board, skin-side down, and evenly spread the stuffing over the top. With the longest side of the breast closest to you, tightly roll it up, then place seam-side down on the board. Drape the streaky bacon widthways along the length of the turkey., Tie up the turkey breast with 5 or 6 pieces of kitchen string, about 5cm apart, knotting them tightly to secure the roll. Drizzle over a little oil and season with sea salt and black pepper., Place the turkey breast in a roasting tin, cover with tin foil and roast for 1 hour and 20 minutes (or 40 minutes per kilo), removing the foil for the last 20 minutes to allow the bacon to crisp up.

Daisy was in the army, and she would always look forward to having this when she came home. It’s a closely guarded family recipe – and you’ll see why when you taste it! It’s cheesy, it’s gooey, and it’s packed with herby sautéed mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, streaky bacon and three types of cheese. If you want to go for the fully Betty effect, serve up with chipolata sausages alongside. ”",699,41.2g,18.6g,9.8g,1.3g,22.8g,63.2g,2.7g,"250                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                portobello mushrooms, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                sun-dried tomatoes in oil, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh thyme (15g), olive oil, 3                                                                                                                                                                rashers of                                                                                                                                                                higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon, 70                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                breadcrumbs, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh flat-leaf parsley (15g), 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried macaroni, 80                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter, 80                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                plain flour, 1                                                                                                                                                                litre                                                                                                                                                                whole milk, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Cheddar cheese, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Emmental cheese, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Gruyère cheese, higher-welfare chipolata sausages                                                                                                                                                                , optional","Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Finely slice the mushrooms and tomatoes, and pick the thyme leaves.

Divide the meat mixture into six, and roll into balls., Place a ball on the palm of your hand, then pat and flatten until it’s big enough to wrap around the egg. Place a peeled egg in the centre and mould the meat up and around it, sealing the egg inside so you end up with a perfectly round ball., Coat it in flour, dunk it in the egg, allowing any excess to drip off, then roll in the breadcrumbs until well coated. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, then chill for 30 minutes., When you’re ready to cook, just under half fill a large sturdy pan with oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go., Carefully lower one Scotch egg into the pan – after about 8 minutes it should be golden and perfectly cooked through, so scoop it out, drain on kitchen paper and cut it in half to check your timings, then cook the rest, in small batches, adjusting the time, if needed., Delicious served with a dollop of English mustard, a wedge of Westcombe Cheddar, piccalilli, a few salady bits and bobs, and – of course – a nice, cold beer.

Cook for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Add the vinegar and cook completely away, then pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Half-fill the tin with water, swirl around and pour into the pan., Simmer for 15 more minutes, or until thickened, then taste and season to perfection., Meanwhile, bring the pan of water back up to boil, and cook the pasta according to the packet instructions, adding the broccoli florets for the last 4 minutes., Drain the pasta and broccoli, reserving a mugful of cooking water. Toss through the sauce, loosening with a little reserved water, if needed., Finely grate in most of the Parmesan and toss together, then serve with the rest of the Parmesan grated over the top."

Drizzle with a little oil and toss to mix it all together., Pop the sausages out of their skins and break each one into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball shape and place in an ovenproof dish. Drizzle over a little oil and roll to coat.

Stir until the garlic is coloured, then tip in the tomatoes., Add a pinch of salt and pepper, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Cook the rigatoni according to the packet instructions, taking it off the heat 2 minutes early, so it’s al dente. Drain in a colander and tip into a large baking dish., Add the sausage balls, pour over the sauce and toss well. Sprinkle over the cheesy crumb mix and bake for 15 minutes, or until golden on top and bubbling."

Add to the platter., Remove the leaves from the rosemary sprigs, but leave the tops intact. Sharpen the bare ends of the sprigs with a knife., Finely chop the picked leaves and sprinkle over the meat, along with a few gratings of nutmeg. Drizzle olive oil over everything and season well., Take a skewer, put a quail leg on first, then a wedge of pear, a bay leaf, a piece of sausage, bread, quail breast, garlic, and so on, in any order you fancy, until they are all stacked up. Try to put the quail legs and thighs at the end so they get more heat, and breasts in the middle and make sure you don’t jam things on so tightly that the heat can’t circulate., Halve the bacon rashers and wrap them around the skewers wherever you like., Cover the leafy skewer tops with tin foil to keep them from burning. Lay  in a roasting tray and put in the oven; turn it down to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning and glazing with a little honey and balsamic halfway. During the last 10 minutes, glaze them often to build up a sticky crust., Boil the greens for 3 to 4 minutes in boiling salted water. Drain and toss in the pan with a knob of butter, extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice., Taste the celeriac for seasoning, then divide between the plates with the greens. Put a skewer on each plate, then add yoghurt or crème fraîche to the pan they were cooked in. Scrape the bottom of the pan to pick up all the flavours. Drizzle the pan juices over each plate and dig in."

9)., Peel 3 cloves of garlic and bash well in a pestle and mortar with half the thyme leaves and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then muddle in a good splash of oil. Rub all over the chicken, getting into all the nooks and crannies. Halve the lemon and place in the cavity with the remaining thyme sprigs., Season the duck all over, rub with a good drizzle of oil, then finely grate over half the cinnamon stick. Place the rest of the stick in the cavity with the sage., Reserving the herby tops, trim and halve the fennel, then place in a large roasting tray with the whole, unpeeled onions and the remaining garlic cloves., Sit the chicken and duck on the top shelf of the oven, directly on the bars, with the fennel tray underneath., Turn the temperature down to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and cook for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and the juices run clear., Pick the leaves from the rosemary sprigs into the pestle and mortar, then bash and bruise with a good splash of oil. Season the pigeons, partridges and quails all over, then drizzle with the rosemary oil., Gently untwist the links between the sausages and push the meat along to make one giant sausage. Start curling one end in, then twirl the sausage round itself until you have one big spiral of sausage, poking in the bay leaves., Sharpen the ends of the rosemary sprigs, then use them to skewer and secure the sausages in place. Drizzle with oil., Once the chicken is cooked, remove to a plate, cover with tin foil and a clean tea towel, then leave to rest., Place the rest of the birds directly on the oven shelf next to the duck. Sit the sausage wheel on top of the veg in the tray, then cook it all for 30 minutes, or until the birds are tender and cooked through., Meanwhile, to make the gremolata, peel the garlic, finely chop with the parsley leaves, then place in a bowl with the reserved fennel tops. Finely grate over the lemon zest, add a squeeze of juice and mix well., Remove the cooked birds from the oven and leave to rest. Move the roasting tray to the top shelf for a further 15 minutes, or until the sausage is cooked through and golden., Meanwhile, bring 1.1 litres of water to the boil in a large pan, then gradually add the polenta, whisking continuously until combined. Continue to stir over the heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until oozy, thick and smooth., Transfer the cooked veggies and sausage wheel to a plate, then skim away and discard the fat from the tray. Place on a medium heat on the hob, stir in the flour for 1 minute, then pour in the Chianti. Scrape up all that goodness from the bottom of the tray, then add the plum tomatoes, any resting juices from the chicken and the stock., Bring to the boil, then simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened and reduced to a lovely gravy consistency., Stir the butter into the polenta and finely grate in the Parmesan, loosening with a little water, if needed. Season to taste., Carve up the birds and slice the sausage, squeeze the onions and garlic out of their skins, then serve it all up on a board with the polenta. Scatter over the gremolata and serve the gravy and some steamed greens on the side."

Squeeze between your hands to get rid of the excess liquid, then transfer to a separate bowl., Tip in the soft onions and mix together – the bread will cool the onions down quickly., Once completely cool, add the sausagemeat or squeeze the meat out of the chipolata skins into the bowl and use clean hands to scrunch it all together. This is your base stuffing mix and it’s delicious!, Or, you can embellish it with one or a combination of the ideas: 1 small handful of chopped dried fruit, such as cranberries, raisins, dates, dried apricots; 1 splash of sherry or sweet wine; 1 handful of pine nuts or chopped mixed nuts; the finely grated zest of 1 clementine or 1 small orange; a good grating of nutmeg., Rub the inside of a baking dish (20cm x 30cm) with butter., Reserve one handful (roughly 200g) of stuffing for your turkey, then push the rest into the dish, spreading it out fairly evenly., Use any extra herbs, nuts and dried fruits you have to decorate the top, pushing them in with your fingers. Drizzle with a little oil to help it crisp up, then pop in the fridge until you’re ready to cook., Bake at 180°C/350°F/gas 4 at the bottom of the oven so you get a really crispy base, for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through."

Cut squash into even chunks and cook in a pan of boiling salted water for about 30 minutes, until soft (to check, insert a knife into the flesh). Drain in a colander, and allow to steam dry for a few minutes., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/gas 5. While the squash is cooking, ask the kids to untwist the sausage links, then shape into 2 coils. Get them to pick and poke sage leaves into the sausage coils at intervals. Stick wooden skewers through the coils to keep them intact., When it’s cooled a little, the children can mash the squash with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, the butter, cumin and a good grating of nutmeg, then season with sea salt and black pepper, to taste., Cut the apples into wedges, then pop the sausages and apples on a baking tray with any extra sage leaves – and the seeds from the squash, if you like. Drizzle with olive oil, then bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the sausages are golden and crispy, and the apples golden and soft. Cut the sausages into wedges and serve with the roasted apples, the squash mash, gravy or chutney, and some steamed green beans or broccolini."

tomato sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then fry in a good amount of olive oil until lightly coloured. Pick and tear the basil leaves, then add to the pan with the tomatoes. Using the back of a wooden spoon, mush and squash the tomatoes as much as you can. Season to taste., As soon as it comes to the boil, remove the pan from the heat. Strain the sauce through a coarse sieve into a bowl, using the spoon to push any larger bits of tomato through. Discard the basil and garlic left in the sieve, but scrape any tomatoey goodness off the back of the sieve into the bowl. Pour the sauce back into the pan, bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Cook until it’s the perfect consistency for spreading on your pizza bases., For the pizza dough, sieve the flour and salt onto a clean work surface and make a well in the middle. In a jug, mix the yeast, sugar and olive oil into 650ml lukewarm water and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well. Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. When it all starts to come together, work the rest of the flour in with your clean hands. Knead until you have a smooth, springy dough. Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for an hour until the dough has doubled in size., Remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out. You can use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in clingfilm, in the fridge (or freezer) until required. If using straight away, divide the dough up into 6 to 8 balls., Timing-wise, it’s a good idea to roll the pizza bases out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to cook them. Stack the pizza bases, with a square of oiled tin foil between each one, cover them with clingfilm, and pop them into the fridge. Now’s the time to get your wood-fired oven, or conventional oven, heated up to full whack. Place a couple of heavy baking trays in the oven to heat up, too., Meanwhile, click off the broccoli florets and roughly chop (using the stalk, too). Blanch in boiled salted water for 1 to 2 minutes, then drain. Tear the anchovies into small pieces, then deseed and finely chop the chilli. Squeeze the sausage meat out of their skins, then roll into small, rough meatballs., When you’re ready to assemble your pizzas, remove a tray from the oven, put a pizza base on it and assemble it quickly – smear tomato sauce on the base and dot with broccoli, torn up anchovy fillets and sausage meatballs. Tear over the Taleggio cheese and sprinkle with chilli. Crush and scatter over the fennel seeds. Place in the oven immediately while you prepare the remaining pizzas. If you’re using a wood-fired oven the pizzas should cook, one by one, in about 3 to 4 minutes – you want them to be puffed up, crispy and delicious. In a regular oven, they’ll take 8 to 10 minutes. Serve hot."

I’m told Rhys makes a mean toad-in-the-hole, and I hope they enjoy this version for years to come. In Yorkshire, I learned how real Yorkshire folk approach making a great Yorkie. They aren’t into making their batter the night before, instead they focus on getting plenty of air into the batter and achieving a hot consistent temperature in the oven. I truly love this great classic and have only ever had one issue with it: quite often, you end up with half a sausage (the toad) poking out of the Yorkshire (the hole). The bit sticking out is crispy and golden – good times – but the other half of the sausage, inside the batter, is soft, anaemic and boiled – bad times. So in the spirit of family-style sharing and creating a dish that makes everyone go ‘Oooh!’ I’m separating out the elements so you end up with amazing crispy sausages, a tray of giant Yorkshire to tear up and a wonderful onion and apple gravy. Heaven., Whisk the eggs, flour, milk and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then pour into a jug. Preheat the oven to full whack (about 240°C/475°F/gas 9). Cut your onions into 1cm thick slices, and do the same with the apples – removing the core. Put a large pan on a medium heat. Add the butter, a lug of olive oil, the onions and the apples. Pick in the leaves from 2 sprigs of rosemary. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden. Remove the sauce from the heat once soft, season, and add the honey and a splash of water, if needed. Put the sausages into a sturdy roasting tray (roughly 30 x 40cm), toss with a little olive oil and cook in the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden., Transfer the cooked sausages to a pretty ovenproof dish and toss with half the apple and onion sauce. Cover with tin foil. Remove any excess fat from the roasting tray, replace with a good lug of olive oil and place on a medium heat. Add the remaining rosemary leaves and after 30 seconds, pour in the batter, then put straight into the middle of the oven with the sausages on the shelf underneath. Cook for around 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pudding is fluffy, golden and puffing up at the sides. Whatever you do, do not open the oven door., Put the pan of apples and onions back on a high heat and stir in the flour. Be brave; let it get really golden before adding the cider, stock and a couple of really good splashes of Worcestershire sauce. Let it boil and bubble away until thickened to your liking. Get your guests to the table, with their knives and forks in their hands. Put the bubbling gravy on a board in the middle of the table., Remove and uncover your sizzling sausages, then slide your Yorkshire pudding on to a nice board. This lovely dish definitely needs balancing, so serve with something green and fresh, like runner beans, greens, salad or dressed chard."

Pour in your grits or cornmeal and cook according to the packet instructions. If you’re using polenta, check the packet to make sure the ratio of water to polenta is the same. Be sure to stand over the pan and stir constantly to make sure there are no lumps and it doesn’t catch. When your grits are ready, add the butter and grated cheese, and stir and beat in really well. Have a taste and add some seasoning to the point where it’s delicious. Pop the lid on the pan to keep the grits warm while you crack on., PRAWN & SAUSAGE TOPPING Get a large frying pan on a medium heat. Squeeze the sausages out of their skins bit by bit and roll the meat into little 2cm balls. Don’t go getting fancy, just pack them into roundish shapes. Once you’ve done that with all your sausages, turn the heat up under the pan and add the meatballs to the pan with a few lugs of olive oil., Shake the pan every now and then, and after 4 or 5 minutes the meatballs should be looking gorgeous all over. Add your prawns and chopped garlic and sprinkle in your smoked paprika. Give everything a good shake and within about 2 minutes the prawns will be perfectly cooked, so add a knob of butter and cook for another minute or two, shaking and stirring every 10 seconds or so. Take the pan off the heat, squeeze in the juice of your lemon, add your chopped parsley and season to taste with a pinch of salt and pepper., TO SERVE Let everything mix together, and stir around to pick up any flavours from the bottom of the pan. Have a taste and check you’re happy with it. Stir a splash of boiling water into your grits to bring them back to life, and divide between your plates. Spoon over the lovely meat and prawns, drizzle over any leftover juices and serve right away. So easy!"

                higher-welfare pancetta","Until recently, I’d always seen this type of pizza as a slightly greedy way of bulking out crusts and toppings. I hadn’t realized Italian immigrants had cleverly adapted their old-world recipes to suit new-world coalfired ovens. Making pizzas in tins to protect the base from the soot of the oven makes perfect sense to me now, and I can honestly say that when it’s cooked and seasoned with proper love and care, I’m more than happy with this representative of the pizza family., To make your dough, pour 650ml of lukewarm water into a large bowl and use a fork to stir in the yeast, sugar and 1 level teaspoon of fine sea salt. Add your flour, bit by bit, until it comes together. You want smooth springy dough, so keep adding a bit more flour if necessary. Dust a clean surface with flour, then knead the dough with your hands. When you’re happy with the consistency, pop it into a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm room until the dough has almost doubled in size., Meanwhile, put a lug of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat. Add your sliced onions and thyme leaves and cook for 15 minutes, or until softened and golden. Take the pan off the heat and put aside. Put all the tomato sauce ingredients into a food processor or liquidizer with a good pinch of salt and black pepper and blitz to a purée. Have a taste and season carefully, adding a bit more salt and pepper if it needs it., Slit the sausages open and squeeze the meat into a bowl. Bash up the dried chilli and fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar, add these to the meat with the dried oregano and mix well with a fork., Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Divide the dough in half and oil 2 trays (about 25 x 35cm) with olive oil. Use a rolling pin or clean hands to flatten and stretch the dough out. Roll or push the dough around each tray and really push it into the corners so you get a chubby crust and a base about 1cm thick., Divide your blitzed tomato sauce between the pizzas and spread around. Scatter over the caramelized onions and dot small pinches of the sausage mixture around the top of each pizza. Tear up the mozzarella and dot the pieces over the sausage, then sprinkle over the fresh basil leaves, sliced fresh chilli, a good pinch of salt and pepper and the grated Parmesan. Finally let your slices of pancetta sort of fall on to the pizzas so they curl and crisp up as they cook. Place in the bottom of the oven for about 20 minutes so the base gets nice and crispy while the top is cooking. Once your pizzas are beautifully cooked, serve right away with a fresh green lemony salad."

or chicken stock","Cook the potatoes and mixed veg in a pan of boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes. When they’re cooked right through, drain and put to one side., Heat a glug of olive oil and half the butter in a large frying pan and add the chestnuts. When they start to sizzle, add your potatoes and veg. Mash the veg up in the pan, then pat the mixture into a thick pancake shape., Fry on a medium heat for about half an hour, checking it every 5 minutes. When the bottom turns golden, flip it over bit by bit and mash it back into itself. Pat it out flat again and continue cooking until really crisp all over., Preheat the oven and a roasting tray to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7., Unravel the pork sausage links and squeeze the filling between them until all 6 sausages are joined together. Do the same to your venison or beef sausages. Pat them to flatten them a bit., Drizzle with olive oil and massage this into your 2 long sausages. Sprinkle over a pinch of pepper, the rosemary and some nutmeg., Put one sausage on top of the other and roll them up like a liquorice wheel! Poke two skewers through, in a cross shape, to hold the sausages together., Take the preheated tray from the oven. Drizzle in some olive oil and add the onions. Season, add the remaining butter and stir. Place the sausage wheel on the onions and stick the bay leaves between the sausages. Drizzle with some more oil and roast in the preheated oven for around 40 minutes, or until
golden and crisp., When your sausages and onions are done, your bubble  and squeak should be ready too. If it still hasn't browned, put it under a hot grill for 5 minutes., Remove the sausages to a plate and place the tray with the onions on the hob. Whack the heat up to full and stir in the flour, balsamic vinegar and stock. Bring to the boil and leave to thicken to a nice gravy consistency, stirring every now and then, and season to taste., Remove the skewers from the sausages and cut the sausages into wedges. Serve the bubble and squeak with a good portion of sausage, a spoonful of onion gravy and perhaps some lovely dressed watercress."

They serve their haggis on large spoons instead of in the sheep’s stomach (which is the traditional way). So I've decided to write a recipe that anyone, anywhere in the world, can make as long as they have access to a fairly decent butcher. I think it still preserves the beautiful soul and attitude of haggis, and my mate Peter Begg, who is 110% Scottish, says it’s the nicest haggis he’s ever had. That made my year, so what are you waiting for?

Stir for a few minutes, until it’s smelling fantastic, then tip in everything from the food processor and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until the veg are starting to soften., Cut the steak into roughly 2cm pieces and pulse in a food processor until it looks like mince. Add to the pan of veg, then do the same with the lamb or mutton and the heart. Get rid of any sinewy bits. Halve the kidneys, and quickly rinse them and the livers in a bowl of water. Drain, then pulse in the processor once or twice – don’t purée them! Add to the pan, then cook and stir everything for about 15 minutes, or until the meat starts to colour. At this point, add the bay leaves and 500ml of stock or water, then cover with a lid and leave to blip away on a low heat for around 2 hours, stirring now and then to make sure it doesn’t catch and adding a splash of water if needed., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. After 2 hours, spoon a few ladles of the haggis mixture (avoiding the bay leaves) into the clean food processor and blitz to a fairly smooth consistency. Stir this back in to add a lovely creaminess. Spread the pinhead oats on a baking tray and toast in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until golden. Stir into the haggis mixture, then add the remaining stock. Simmer with the lid off for about another 30 to 35 minutes. This is a great time to cook your neeps and tatties., Once the time is up, fish out the bay leaves and continue cooking until you’ve got a nice thick consistency. Turn the heat off, then correct the seasoning to push it to the point of perfection. Stir in the whisky, a few gratings of lemon and orange zest and the Worcestershire sauce. Taste and correct the flavours if needed, then put the lid on and leave until you’re ready to serve – preferably with plenty of good friends and a dram or two of fine Scottish whisky., PS: Put the leftover haggis into an earthenware-type dish and top it off with neeps and tatties. It makes the most exciting sorta-shepherd’s pie."

Cut a slit into each sausage and squeeze the meat out into a large ovenproof pan with a little olive oil. Cook on a medium heat for around 10 minutes, or until golden and crispy, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon as you go. Add the chopped fennel, and fennel seeds, then crumble in the dried chilli. Finely chop and add the rosemary leaves, then cook for a further 10 minutes, or until the fennel has softened. Pour in the wine and passata and top up with 400ml water, give it a stir, then pop the lid on. Transfer to the oven and leave to blip away for 2 hours – check on it every 40 minutes, stirring and adding a splash of water if it starts to dry out., Meanwhile, if you’re making fresh pasta, get on with making your dough. Add the eggs and flour to a food processor with a pinch of salt and whiz until combined. Roll the dough through a pasta machine, starting on the widest setting and working your way down to the second to last. If you don’t have a pasta machine simply divide the pasta into 6 pieces and roll each piece into nice thin sheets using a rolling pin. Once at the right thickness (you’re aiming for slightly thicker than a playing card) roll through the pappardelle cutter or lightly roll in half and over once more, then slice into 2.5cm pieces and toss to separate, dusting with flour to stop it from sticking.

Cook the pasta for 2 to 3 minutes in boiling salted water (or if you’re using dried pasta, cook according to packet instructions), then drain, reserving a cupful of the cooking water. Taste and check the ragu seasoning, then mix through the pasta, loosening with a splash of cooking water if needed. Divide between your plates or bowls, and finish with a grating of Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

Boil for 3 to 4 minutes, then transfer to a bowl of cold water. Once cooled, carefully peel them., Squeeze the sausages out of their skins and into a bowl., Pick and finely chop the herb leaves, add to the sausage meat along with a good grating of nutmeg, the mustard and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Give it all a good mix together then divide into 8 balls., Have 3 plates ready - one with a small handful of flour, one with the two remaining eggs (beat them together first), and a third with the breadcrumbs., Start by flouring your hands, then in the palm of one hand, flatten one of the sausage balls into an oval-shaped pattie., Roll a peeled egg in flour, then pop it in the middle of the patty Gently shape the meat evenly around the egg, moulding it with your hands until sealed., Roll the meat-wrapped egg in the flour, shake off any excess, then dip into the beaten egg, followed by the breadcrumbs. Roll in the egg and breadcrumbs again for a really good coating., Heat the oil in a deep pan or deep fat fryer to about 150ºC/300ºF. If you have a cooking thermometer it’s a good idea to use it. Otherwise, test if the oil is hot enough by adding a piece of raw potato and leaving it for about 1 minute – if it sizzles and browns, it’s ready., Carefully lower the eggs into the pan and cook for 4 minutes, or until golden, turning them every so often. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper (if you’re worried about the meat being under-cooked, deep-fry the scotch eggs until they’re golden and crispy, then pop them in a hot oven for a couple of minutes.), Cool the Scotch eggs slightly, then arrange on board with a good piece of Scottish Cheddar, some pickle and a few pickled onions.

Gennaro has even stumbled across some at a local park in the middle of London, so keep your eyes open., You should be able to get hold of it at good green grocers or your local farmer’s market, but, if not, you can sort of mimic the flavours by blitzing some fresh spinach and a couple of cloves of regular garlic together, so you get a wonderful green garlicky sauce., Bash up the fennel seeds and chillies in a pestle and mortar, then put to one side. Heat a splash of olive oil in a pan on a medium heat. Cut open the sausage skins and squeeze the meat into the pan. Stir it around with a wooden spoon, breaking it up into small pieces so it resembles coarse mince. Fry for a few minutes until the meat starts to colour and the fat has started to render out., Add the bashed up fennel seeds and chillies to the meat, and cook on a medium heat for around 10 minutes until the meat is crisp, dark golden brown and caramelised. Turn the heat down to low., Put a large saucepan of salted water on to boil. If you managed to get hold of wild garlic leaves, simply blanch them in the boiling water for 3 minutes, then scoop out and put in a food processor. If you aren’t using wild garlic, add the garlic cloves to the water and cook for 3 to 4 minutes before adding the spinach. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, until the spinach has wilted, then fish out all the spinach and the garlic cloves with a slotted spoon, and put it all into a food processor. Add the fusilli to the water, bring it back to the boil and cook according to the packet instructions., Blitz the wild garlic leaves or the cooked garlic and spinach in the food processor, until you have a deep green sauce, then add a lug of olive oil, a grating of lemon zest and a pinch of salt and pepper., When the pasta is al dente, drain it in a colander, reserving some of the cooking water. Put the pasta back in the saucepan and add a splash of the cooking water and a squeeze of lemon juice. Gently stir the lovely green sauce into the pasta to coat it then immediately divide the pasta between your bowls. Top with the delicious crisp sausage meat and a nice grating of Parmesan cheese, and serve."

They’re at their best when the water is really cold, and if there’s a good fishmonger near you they should be able to track them down., The richness of the black pudding works really well with the clean taste of the scallops. And, if you haven’t eaten the roe (the orange bit on the scallop) before, give it a go. Just carefully trim them off the scallops then fry them for some added tastiness!, Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas mark 4. Tear the ciabatta into rough pieces and place in a baking tray. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Pop in the oven and cook for 10 minutes until you’ve got crispy, golden croutons., Put all the salad leaves in a big bowl. Finely slice the celery at an angle and add it to the bowl of salad with the celery leaves., Heat a frying pan on a medium heat. Split the black puddings lengthways, tear them open, crumble into the frying pan and fry until crispy. Don’t be scared if it looks very black and almost burnt - trust me, it will taste delicious. Once ready, remove to a plate and keep warm., Carefully slice the scallops in half so you have 2 rounds from each scallop and score them on one side with a little criss-cross. Season with a little salt and pepper and a sprinkling of lemon zest. Sear for a minute in a frying pan, scored-side down, with a touch of olive oil, and don’t be tempted to touch them! Add the roe to the pan now, too. After a minute, check the underside, and continue to fry until lovely and caramelised. Turn them over and allow the other side to do the same. Be careful not to overcook them though, a minute or so on each side is all they need., Arrange the salad leaves on a large platter, then nestle the lovely scallops in among them. Sprinkle over that wonderful, crispy black pudding and the croutons. Snip the salad cress over the top, and finish with a good squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil. What an amazing treat!"

Eat these while they are hot, crispy and still oozy in the middle, or if you want to go down the picnic route, just boil the eggs for an extra minute. ”",221,14.9g,3.5g,0.4g,0.67g,9.7g,13g,0.6g,"4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    higher-welfare Cumberland sausages                                                                                                                                                                , (about 300g), ½                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                sweet paprika, 1                                                                                                                                                                sprig of                                                                                                                                                                fresh rosemary, 1                                                                                                                                                                sprig of                                                                                                                                                                fresh sage, 1                                                                                                                                                                whole                                                                                                                                                                nutmeg                                                                                                                                                                , for grating, 3                                                                                                                                                                handfuls of                                                                                                                                                                plain flour, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    large free-range eggs, 125                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                white breadcrumbs, 12                                                                                                                                                                                                                    free-range quail's eggs, vegetable oil                                                                                                                                                                , (about 2 litres), 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    new potato                                                                                                                                                                , for testing","Put the kettle on to boil. Pick and very finely chop the rosemary and sage leaves., Tear open the sausages and squeeze the meat on to a plate. Season with the paprika, the chopped herbs, a few gratings of nutmeg and a little sea salt and black pepper, then use a fork to mash it all up., Beat the eggs in a bowl. Put the flour and breadcrumbs into 2 separate bowls, so you have 3 bowls in total., Carefully put the quail’s eggs into a small pan. Once the kettle boils, pour in the boiling water straight away and cook for 2 minutes, no longer. Move the pan to the sink and run cold water over the eggs for 2 to 3 minutes. Tap, roll and – ever so gently – peel the shells off them. Do it under running water if it helps. You’ll get quicker at peeling them as you go., Take a marble-sized piece of sausage meat and flatten it out in the palm of your clean hand until it’s about 6cm in diameter. Pop an egg into the middle, then carefully shape and mould the sausage meat up around the egg with your floured hands. You need to get into the routine of pulling up the sides, gently squeezing, moulding, patting and very gently squashing the meat around the egg., Repeat with all 12 eggs, then coat them well with flour. Transfer them to the bowl of beaten egg and coat well, then roll them in the breadcrumbs. They’ll be more robust to hold now, so pat and hug them into shape. When they’re all done, put them into a container and pop them into the fridge until needed., When you’re ready to cook, put a deep casserole-type pan on a medium-high heat and fill it about 8cm deep with vegetable oil. Make sure you never fill a pan more than halfway up. Add a piece of potato to help you gauge the temperature – it’s ready once the potato turns golden and floats (or when the oil reaches 180°C on a thermometer)., Carefully lower one wee Scotch egg into the pan. After about 4 minutes it should be golden and perfectly cooked through, so take it out of the pan and cut it in half to see if you should have cooked it for less or more time – once you know where you stand, you can cook the rest, in batches of 6 or less., Transfer the cooked Scotch eggs to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain, and serve scattered with a pinch of salt, alongside a pot of English mustard and a cold beer."

I like the batter to go huge so the key thing is to have an appropriately-sized baking tin – the thinner the better – as we need to get the oil smoking hot., Put 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil into a baking tin, then place on the middle shelf of your oven at its highest setting (240–250ºC/475ºF/gas 9). Place a larger tray underneath it to catch any oil that overflows from the tin while cooking., When the oil is very hot, add the sausages – keep an eye on them and allow them to colour until lightly golden., At this point, take the tin out of the oven, being very careful, and pour the batter over the sausages. Throw a couple of sprigs of rosemary into the batter., It will bubble and possibly even spit a little, so carefully put the tin back in the oven, and close the door. Don't open it for at least 20 minutes, as Yorkshire puddings can be a bit temperamental when rising. Remove from the oven when golden and crisp., For the onion gravy, peel and finely slice the onions and garlic, then simply fry off in the butter on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until they go sweet and translucent. You could add a little thyme or rosemary here, if you like. Add the balsamic vinegar and allow it to cook down by half., At this point, I do cheat a little and add a stock cube or powder. You can get some good ones in the supermarkets now that aren't full of rubbish. Sprinkle this in and add a little water. Allow to simmer and you'll have a really tasty onion gravy., Serve at the table with the Toad in the hole, mashed potatoes, greens and baked beans or maybe a green salad if you're feeling a little guilty!"

Put in all your tomatoes, the herb sprigs, oregano, garlic and sausages. Drizzle well with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar and season with salt and pepper., Toss together, then make sure the sausages are on top and pop the tray into the oven for half an hour. After this time, give it a shake and turn the sausages over. Put back into the oven for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how golden and sticky you like your sausages., Once it’s cooked, you’ll have an intense, tomatoey sauce. If it’s a little too thin, lift out the sausages and place the tray on the hob to cook it down to the consistency you like – I tend to make mine quick thick – then put the sausages back in., Check the seasoning and serve either with a good-quality loaf of bread warmed through in a low oven for 10 minutes (great for mopping up the sauce!) or with mashed potato, rice or polenta, a green salad and a nice glass of wine., PS Any leftovers can be chopped up and made into a wonderful chunky pasta dish, using penne or rigatoni, the next day."

roughly chopped","In the UK we love our bangers and mash, don’t we, and you’ll find that this dish is fairly similar but with rice and Louisiana gravy. It pushes similar buttons, and it has the added advantage of extra spices, and it also reminds me of a kinda Italian peperonata. But, let’s be honest, beautiful sausages in a lovely stew are a winning combo in any country., In the spirit of Cajun cooking, this is a simple one-pan dish, perfect whether you’re at home or cooking outdoors. Give this a try and you’ll love it., Put a splash of olive oil in a pan and let it get hot. Add your sausages and let them cook away so they brown nicely on all sides. Once golden and crisp, take them out of the pan and put them on a plate to rest. Depending on your sausages, there may be a lot of fat left behind in the pan. You only want to keep about 4 tablespoons of it in the pan, so carefully pour any extra away. If you don’t have enough, just add a splash more olive oil., Add your onion, peppers and celery to the fat and fry on a medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Stir in your garlic, chilli, thyme and spices and fry for another minute or two. Stir in your flour and vinegar, and after a couple of minutes add your browned sausages, chicken stock and tinned tomatoes, using a wooden spoon to break them up a little. Season with a nice big pinch of sea salt and black pepper, stir, then bring to the boil and let it tick away for 15 minutes or so until you have a thick and delicious gravy., Serve with a hearty spoonful of rice on the side and sprinkle over some sliced spring onion, chopped parsley and any reserved celery leaves. Really tasty stuff!, PS: I’ve also stirred chopped up pieces of cooked chicken, quail and smoky bacon through this with great results!"

Put a little olive oil into a pan, add the onion and sliced garlic, throw in the cinnamon stick and a good crumbling of chilli, and fry on a gentle heat for 10 minutes until the onions are soft and sweet. Now turn the heat up and add your red wine vinegar – it will steam and might even make you cough but this is a normal reaction! Then turn the heat down to low and add your tinned tomatoes, chopped up. Simmer slowly for half an hour while you get on with your lentils., Put a pan of water on for your broccoli and preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Put the lentils into a pot, cover them with water, and add the 2 whole cloves of garlic, the bay leaf and some tied-up stalks from the parsley. Simmer for around 20 minutes, making sure that you’ve got enough liquid covering the lentils. Toss your sausages in a little olive oil and put them in a roasting tray in the preheated oven for 25 minutes or until golden and crisp. Drop your broccoli into boiling water for a few minutes when the sausages come out of the oven. When done, drain in a colander and toss in a bowl with a squeeze of lemon juice and some extra virgin olive oil., Once the lentils are cooked, remove the parsley stalks and bay leaf and pour away most of the water from the pan. Mash the garlic cloves up with a spoon, mix in with the lentils and dress them using 4 tablespoons of good extra virgin olive oil and 1 or 2 tablespoons of good vinegar. Throw in all your finely chopped parsley leaves, mix and season., Remove the sausages from the roasting tray and pour away any fat. Tip the lentils into your serving bowls. Remove the cinnamon stick from the salsa rossa and discard it, then season well to taste and spoon it over your lentils. Place 2 sausages, either sliced or whole, on top. Sprinkle with the thyme and serve with a big bowl of steaming broccoli."

Heat the olive oil in a saucepan and add the onions. Cook gently for about 20 minutes until soft and golden brown. Add the sage leaves, cook for a couple of minutes more and then spread out on a plate to cool., With a sharp knife, slit the skins of the sausages and pop the meat out. Put it in a mixing bowl with the cooled sage and onion mix and the breadcrumbs. Add a good grating of nutmeg, then scrunch well with your clean hands to mix together., On a floured work surface, roll the pastry out into a big rectangle as thick as a pound coin and cut it lengthways into two long, even rectangles. Roll the mixture into sausage shapes with your hands and lay along the centre of each rectangle., Mix the egg and milk and brush the pastry with the mixture, then fold one side of the pastry over, wrapping the filling inside. Press down with your fingers or the edge of a spoon to seal the join., Cut the long rolls into the sizes you want and space them out on a baking tray. Brush with the rest of the egg wash and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes or until puffed, golden and cooked through. Serve with piccalilli and a cress salad., Tip: Lamb or beef sausages work just as well in this recipe if you don’t fancy pork."

If you are a fan of sausages and eggs you’ll love this combination. Not only does it look impressive but it’s so quick to make. There’s a subtle line between having a smooth, silky egg sauce and scrambled eggs – both will taste delicious but smooth and silky is far more desirable., With a sharp knife, slit the sausage skins lengthways and pop all the meat out. Using wet hands, roll little balls of sausagemeat about the size of large marbles and place them to one side., Heat a large frying pan and add a good splash of olive oil. Gently fry the sausage meatballs until golden brown all over, then add the pancetta and continue cooking for a couple of minutes, until it’s golden. While this is cooking, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the linguine, and cook according to the packet instructions., In a large bowl, whip up the egg yolks, cream, half the Parmesan, the lemon zest and parsley. When the pasta is cooked, drain it in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water, and immediately toss it quickly with the egg mixture back in the pasta pan. Add the hot sausage meatballs and toss everything together. The egg will cook delicately from the heat of the linguine, just enough for it to thicken and not scramble. The sauce should be smooth and silky. If the pasta becomes a little claggy, add a few spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water to loosen it slightly. Sprinkle over the rest of the Parmesan, season if necessary, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve. Eat immediately!"

Snip the sausages apart, then squeeze and pinch the meat out of the skins so that you get little meatball shapes – don’t make them too big or they will take too long to cook., Try to get at least three balls out of each sausage. Don’t worry about rolling them into perfect balls and making them look all fancy – rough and rustic is good! Put them into your pan. Keep frying and turning the meatballs until they’re golden brown and cooked through., Meanwhile, put the spaghetti into a large pan of salted boiling water and cook according to the packet instructions until al dente., To make your tomato sauce, heat a separate pan and pour in some olive oil. Add the garlic and the chopped basil stalks and move them around the pan for a couple of minutes. Put some small basil leaves to one side for later, and sprinkle the rest into the pan. Add the tomatoes and season carefully to taste., Bring to a simmer, break up your tomatoes a bit more with a spoon and add a swig of balsamic vinegar – it’s lovely for adding sweetness to the sauce., Add the herbs to the pan of sausage meatballs, tossing everything in all the lovely flavours. Cook for around 30 seconds. When your spaghetti is cooked, drain it and divide the pasta and meatballs between four bowls., Spoon over the tomato sauce. Sprinkle over the reserved basil leaves and serve with a handful of fresh peas per person in the middle of the table, so that everyone can have a go at podding their own, and a little Parmesan for grating and shaving over the top."

Put to one side., Heat a lug of olive oil in a heavy-bottomed frying pan over a high heat. Squeeze the meat out of the sausage skins or add the pork mince to the pan, really breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon. Fry for a few minutes, or until the meat starts to colour and the fat has rendered slightly, then push it down once more so it resembles coarse mince., Add the bashed-up fennel seeds and chillies and cook over a medium heat for around 10 minutes, or until the meat becomes crisp, golden brown and slightly caramelised., Stir in the oregano, then pour in the white wine and allow it to reduce by half. Finely grate over the zest of 1 lemon, then squeeze over the  juice and turn the heat down to low., Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pan of salted boiling water according to the packet instructions., When the pasta has cooked but still has a bit of bite, drain it in a colander, reserving a mugful of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the meat pan, then toss to coat in all those lovely flavours, loosening with a good splash of the reserved cooking water, if needed., Grate in the Parmesan, then pick, roughly chop and add the parsley leaves. Taste and check the seasoning, then serve immediately with a little extra grated Parmesan sprinkled over the top., Jamie’s top tip Remember to buy the best sausages you can afford – if you get cheap, dodgy sausages it just won’t work."

   fresh curly parsley","Jambalaya is a French word that means ‘jumbled’ or ‘mixed up’, and I have no doubt that the philosophy and heart of this recipe come from a similar place to paella, kedgeree and risotto., Originally, any Louisiana ‘critter’ unlucky enough to get caught would have gone into this: rabbit, duck, squirrel, frog, alligator. . . you name it! And similarly, you can adapt it to whatever your local butcher or fishmonger happens to have. Go cheaper by using things like frozen prawns and chicken livers, or more expensive by including lobster or crab. I used an incredible local smoked sausage called andouille, but fresh chorizo or any other smoked sausage would work just as well., This dish makes me happy every time I eat it. And if more people than expected turn up for dinner just add a bit of extra rice., Season the chicken with sea salt, black pepper and a pinch of cayenne. Pour a couple of lugs of oil into a large casserole type pan and brown the chicken pieces and sliced sausage over a medium heat. After 5 minutes, once nicely browned on all sides, add your onion, peppers and celery as well as your bay, thyme and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir, then fry on a medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes stirring every now and again. It’s important to control the heat of the pan: you don’t want it to be so slow nothing’s happening, or so fast that things are catching and burning. You want a steady, solid heat., Once the veg have softened, add your garlic and chillies, stir around for a minute, then stir in the tinned tomatoes and chicken stock., Bring everything to the boil, then turn the heat down, pop the lid on the pan and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. When you can pull the meat off the bone and shred it easily the chicken’s ready. Feel free to remove the chicken bones at this point if you like, then add your rice. Give it all a good stir, then put the lid on. Give it a stir every few minutes, scraping the goodness off the bottom of the pan as you go. Let it cook for about 15 to 20 minutes until the rice is perfectly cooked. Stir in the prawns and if it needs it, add enough water to make it a kind of porridgey consistency (look at the picture). Pop the lid back on and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes while you chop your parsley. Stir the parsley through and serve on a lovely big platter. I absolutely love this with a lemony green salad."

Turn the chipolatas over, add the mushrooms to the tray, face up, drizzle with a little oil and season with sea salt and black pepper., Lay the bacon in and around everything and pop the tray back under the grill for another 7 to 8 minutes, or until the chipolatas are cooked through., When the tray of extras is just about perfect, turn the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and pop them down at the bottom of the oven to keep warm,, Give the bubble and squeak one final pat down and use the back of a spoon to make four dents, evenly spaced around the pan. Crack in the eggs – it looks fantastic, isn’t predictable and saves on washing up., Season with a tiny bit of salt and pepper and put in the oven for about 8 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking., To serve, pop the tray of bubble & squeak and eggs in the middle of the table with the tray of extras on the side."
