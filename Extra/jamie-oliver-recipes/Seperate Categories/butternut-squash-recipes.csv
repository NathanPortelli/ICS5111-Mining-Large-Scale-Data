180°C/350°F/gas 4. Place the squash (or pumpkin) on a baking tray, carefully pierce once or twice with the tip of a sharp knife, then bake in the oven for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until golden and very soft, then transfer to a board to cool completely., For the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar in a large bowl. Finely grate in the orange zest. Chop the butter into cubes, then rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs., Beat and stir in 1 egg, then gently scrunch the dough into a ball – be careful not to overwork it. Wrap and rest in the freezer or fridge for 30 minutes., Slice the pastry lengthways into pieces just under 1cm thick, then distribute around the sides and base of a 26cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Use fingertips to press them together really well and create one piece of pastry, letting it bulge above the brow of the tin (don’t worry if it’s not perfect, just try to create a fairly even layer). Place in the freezer to chill while you crack on with the filling., Once the squash (or pumpkin) is cool enough to handle, remove the stalk and, using a knife and tongs, carefully slice lengthways, down the middle. Scoop out the seeds and put aside for tasty cooking another day, then weigh out 400g-450g of squash flesh (check out the tips below for leftover ideas)., Whiz the flesh in a food processor until smooth with the remaining egg yolks (reserving the whites for later), sugar, vanilla bean paste, double cream, ground spices, a good few gratings of nutmeg and a pinch of sea salt., In a clean bowl, whisk the reserved egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff glossy peaks form. Fold the squash/pumpkin mixture into the egg whites and pour into the pie crust., Bake at the bottom of the oven for 45 minutes, or until the filling is set and the top slightly cracked. Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool completely., For the praline, line a small baking tray or plate with greaseproof paper. Place the maple syrup in a small non-stick frying pan on a medium heat and bring to the boil. Add the pecans and cook for 1 minute, and when nicely coated and golden, carefully pour onto the greaseproof paper and leave to set., Place the cranberry sauce in a bowl, then squeeze and stir in half the orange juice to loosen. In a separate bowl, whip the double cream until soft peaks form, then fold through the cranberry sauce mixture., Slice up the pie, then bash up and sprinkle over the praline (I sometimes like to decorate with whole pecans, too) and serve with dollops of cranberry cream."

Fry for 5 minutes, or until browned, stirring regularly, then strip in the rosemary leaves and stir in the Cajun seasoning and smoked paprika for 1 minute., Go in with the frozen mixed veg and a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden, stirring occasionally., Peel, deseed and chop the butternut squash into 1.5cm chunks, then peel and finely chop the garlic. Add everything to the pan along with the balsamic vinegar, stirring for 1 minute, then add the beans (juices and all)., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Tip in the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of your spoon, then half-fill each tin with water, swirl around and pour into the pan., Bring to the boil, then cover with a lid and bake in the oven for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the squash is tender and the sauce is slightly thickened, removing the lid for the final 30 minutes and adding splashes of water, if needed., Once the time’s up, gently mash around a third of the chilli, until some of the beans are squashed into the sauce, then give everything a good stir. Taste and season to perfection, tweaking with a little balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil, if you like. Pick over the coriander leaves and serve with fluffy rice, dollops of yoghurt and a fresh green salad."

Scrub the squash (there’s no need to peel it), carefully halve it lengthways and deseed, then chop into 2cm chunks., Place the squash in a roasting tray, pick and chop most of the marjoram leaves, then toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Roast for 1 hour, or until soft and caramelised., With 20 minutes to go on the squash, simmer the stock over a low heat. Peel and finely chop the onion and celery, then place in a high-sided pan on a medium heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring regularly, then stir in the rice to toast for 2 minutes., Pour in the wine and stir until absorbed. Add a ladleful of stock and wait until it’s been fully absorbed before adding another, stirring constantly and adding ladlefuls of stock until the rice is cooked – it will need 16 to 18 minutes., Remove the squash from the oven and mash up with a fork – I like to do half smashed and leave half chunky, then stir through the risotto about halfway through., Meanwhile, trim the broccoli, halving any larger stalks lengthways to help it cook evenly. Steam for 2 minutes, or until just cooked but still full of colour, then toss with the lemon juice and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and season to perfection., When the risotto is done, add enough extra stock or boiling kettle water to make the risotto oozy, then finely grate in the Parmesan, and beat in with the butter., Cover the pan, turn off the heat and leave to relax for 2 minutes. Stir, season to perfection, then divide between your plates., Pick over the remaining marjoram and serve topped with the broccoli. Lovely."

I’ve kept things fairly gentle on the spice front so that all my kids will give it a go, but feel free to add extra heat, if you like. I’m also giving you a cheat’s naan, which all my kids fight over. We’re using it as a vehicle to really bring spinach to life, but feel free to stuff with another veg of your choice, or to not stuff it at all!

to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., In a large roasting tray, mix the curry paste with a pinch of sea salt, 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon of vinegar., Wash the parsnip, carrots and butternut squash (we’re leaving the skins on). Quarter the parsnip lengthways, remove the fluffy core and chop into bite-sized chunks (about 2cm), adding to the tray as you go., Repeat with the courgette, then chop up the carrots. Deseed the squash and chop to a similar size. Get it all in the tray with the cauliflower and mix until well coated., Roast the veg for 40 to 50 minutes, or until golden, gnarly and cooked through., Meanwhile, for the sauce, put a large shallow casserole pan on a medium heat. Peel and finely chop the ginger and garlic, and place in the pan with 1 tablespoon of oil, stirring regularly., As soon as it starts to colour, stir in the mango chutney. Let it sizzle for a minute, then pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with your spoon. As soon as they start to bubble, add the coconut milk. Bring it to the boil, then turn off the heat., To make the naans, melt the butter in a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat, then add the cloves and cinnamon stick., Trim the leek and quarter lengthways, wash, finely slice and add to the pan, followed by the spinach. Stir regularly, until dark, dry and intense, then remove and leave to cool., Pour the flour into a large bowl with a pinch of salt, make a well in the middle and add 1 mug (300ml) of water (using the same mug you used to measure your flour, a regular cup is fine) and 1 tablespoon of oil. Use a fork to gradually mix the flour into the liquid, until it gets too hard to mix., At this point, use your clean floured hands to knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for a couple of minutes, adding a little extra flour, if needed. You want it to be pliable so don’t add too much flour, but it shouldn’t be sticking to your work surface., Now, oil your surface, then stretch and push the dough out into a 30cm circle. Crumble the feta over the cool spinach mixture and mix together, then place in the middle of the dough, leaving a 5cm border at the edge., Fold in the dough over the filling, patting it together as you go and sealing the filling inside, then pat out to just under 25cm. Wipe out your frying pan, then gently lift the naan into it., Cook the naan at the bottom of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and crisp on the outside, fluffy in the middle., A few minutes before you’re ready to serve, bring the sauce back to a simmer, then add all the roasted veg and the frozen peas, and simmer until the peas are cooked and the sauce is a good consistency., Slice up your naan and serve up with your curry at the table. Nice with a dollop of yoghurt and any chutney or pickles, if you like."

Coarsely grate in the paneer and squash (deseed if needed), then peel and finely grate in the ginger. Sprinkle in the flour and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then squeeze over the lime juice. Add the curry paste and 50ml of water, then mix., Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat, then roughly divide the mixture into 4 portions and place in the pan, flattening them out into rough rounds, about the width of the buns (don’t worry about wispy edges, it’ll mean bonus crunch later!). Fry for 16 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning every few minutes. Meanwhile, pound most of the coriander leaves to a paste in a pestle and mortar, muddle in the yoghurt, then season to taste. Finely shred the lettuce, halve the burger buns (warm first, if you like), and puff up the dry poppadoms in the microwave for 30 seconds each., Divide the coriander yoghurt between the bases and inside bun-lids, then break up the poppadoms and sprinkle over. Place a crispy bhaji burger on top of each bun-base, add a dollop of mango chutney, a few coriander leaves and the lettuce, then pop the tops on and press down lightly., Serve with a cold beer and extra fresh chilli if you love a bit of heat (like me!)."

chunks., Pour 800ml of boiling salted water into a large pan over a medium-high heat, add the coconut cream and leave to melt, then add the pumpkin and allspice berries., Trim the spring onions and bash with your fist, then halve and drop into the pan with half the thyme sprigs and the whole Scotch bonnets (no holes or bruises please)., Roughly chop the cabbage, discarding the core, then add to the pan with ½ a teaspoon each of sea salt and black pepper. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, then rinse and stir in the rice., Pop the lid back on, turn the heat down to low and cook for 12 minutes, or until the water is absorbed. Turn the heat off and leave to steam., Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic and peel and roughly chop the onion, then place in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil and cook for 5 minutes., Halve the tomatoes, then remove the chillies from the rice, carefully deseed, slice, and add half to the pan (feel free to add more later, to taste, and remember to clean your knife, board and hands thoroughly after)., Pick in the remaining thyme leaves, then trim and halve the okra and add to the pan. Cover and cook for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, then tip in the beans (juices and all) to warm through for a few minutes., Fork up the rice, breaking up the pumpkin, and serve with the beans, seasoning everything to perfection."

Carefully slice at just under ½cm intervals all the way along, putting the veg into a large roasting tray as you go., Peel the garlic and place in a pestle and mortar, strip in the thyme leaves, then bash to a paste and muddle in 6 tablespoons of oil, the vinegar, and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Toss well with the veg, then roast for 1 hour, or until golden and caramelised, turning halfway., Remove all the veg to a board and place the tray over a medium heat on the hob. Pour in the wine and leave to bubble and cook away, scraping up all the sticky caramelised bits from the bottom of the tray., Tip in the lentils (juices and all) and spinach, then stir until the juices have thickened and the leaves have wilted., Season to taste with salt and pepper, ripple through the yoghurt, then present to the table with the board of veg.

very gently apply pressure so that the liquid starts to drip through into a bowl, then leave to drain., Halve the tomatoes, season with sea salt and black pepper, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar, then toss and leave to macerate (this really brings out the flavour)., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Peel and finely slice the garlic, then place in a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat with the fennel seeds and 2 tablespoons of olive oil., Fry for a few minutes, stirring regularly, while you prep the veg, adding to the pan as you go: trim, wash and slice the leek, scrub the potatoes, squash (deseed, if needed) and courgettes and chop into 2cm chunks., Cover and cook for 15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, then remove the lid, tip in the chickpeas (juices and all) and season lightly with a pinch of salt and pepper., Finely chop the preserved lemon, discarding any pips, then add to the pan with a drizzle of juice from the jar, and the harissa. Fry for a further 15 minutes, or until beautifully caramelised, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, cover the sour cherries and saffron with 300ml of boiling water, leave for a few minutes, then add to the pan with the tomatoes, reserving the macerating juices., Lay the filo out flat, then brush all over with the reserved tomato juices. Roughly scrunch, wave and layer the filo into the pan, partly tucking it in at the edges (there’s no need to be neat)., Scatter over the sesame seeds and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Transfer the yoghurt to a plate and drizzle with a little oil from the harissa jar, then serve with the pie."

mixing bowl. Scrub the carrot and squash, then coarsely grate into the bowl, along with the paneer. Peel the garlic and ginger and finely grate it into the bowl. Finely chop the green chillies (deseed if you like) and half the coriander (stalks and all) and add to the mix., Tip in the flour, turmeric and cumin, season with sea salt and black pepper, then squeeze in the juice of 1 lime. Add 100ml of water, then get in there with clean hands and give it a good mix up. Divide into 6, then shape and squash into 3cm-thick patties., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, add the patties and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp – you may need to work in batches. Remove to a baking tray and pop in the oven for 10 minutes, or until cooked through., For the coriander yoghurt, pick the remaining coriander leaves into a pestle and mortar, setting aside a handful for garnish. Add a pinch of salt, then bash to a paste. Squeeze in the juice of half the remaining lime, then stir in the yoghurt., Finely shred the lettuce, finely slice the red chilli (if using), halve the burger buns., To assemble, spoon a little coriander yoghurt over the base and inside lid of each burger bun. Crumble the poppadoms and sprinkle over the yoghurt, then sit a patty on top of each base and spread with 1 tablespoon of mango chutney. Top with a handful of lettuce, a few reserved coriander leaves and a sprinkling of red chilli, then place the bun lid on top. Serve with the remaining lime cut into wedges for squeezing over.

30 minutes, then remove from the oven., Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the onion, put it into a medium pan on a medium-low heat with a lug of oil, the thyme and a pinch of salt and pepper, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Stir in the frozen spinach, cover with a lid and allow to slowly cook for another 15 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated, then remove from the heat., Cut the squash in half, discard the seeds and skin, then mash up with a fork. Keeping them separate, season both the squash and spinach to perfection with sea salt, black pepper and a grating of nutmeg., Peel and finely slice the garlic, then put it into a shallow 28cm casserole pan on a medium heat with a splash of oil and fry for a couple of minutes, or until lightly golden., Pour in the passata, then add a splash of water to the empty jar, swirl it around and pour it into the pan. Bring to the boil, simmer for just 3 minutes, then season to perfection., On a lean work surface, lay out the pasta sheets facing lengthways away from you., Working quickly so your pasta doesn't dry out, brush them with water, then evenly divide and spread the squash over the sheets. Sprinkle over the cooked spinach and crumble over the feta., Roll up the sheets and cut each one into 4 chunks, then place side by side in the tomato sauce. Finely grate over the Parmesan, then pick the sage leaves (if using), toss in a little oil and scatter over the top., Bake for 35 to 40 minutes at the bottom of the oven until golden and crisp.

  skin-on almonds","Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., To make your filling, wash the squash, carefully cut it in half lengthways and remove the seeds, then chop into eight big chunks and place in a large roasting tray., Add the whole ricotta, sprinkle over the chilli flakes and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then finely grate over half the nutmeg. Drizzle with oil and gently toss together. Roast for 1 hour., Crumble up the chestnuts, pick the sage leaves, toss both in a little oil, then sprinkle into the tray. Roast for another 15 minutes, or until the squash is tender and golden, and the ricotta is gnarly-looking., Finely grate the Parmesan into the tray, season and mash it all together, as chunky or smooth as you like. Leave to cool completely., Make the pasta dough in a food processor, blitzing the spinach and egg yolks together before adding the dry ingredients. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and pop into the fridge for 30 minutes., Divide the pasta in half, saving one half for another day. Cut the remaining piece in two (wrapping one piece back up momentarily), and roll out into sheets that are just 2mm thick – use a pasta machine, or do it by hand with a rolling pin., Cut into rectangles 15cm x 12cm. Spoon 2 tablespoons of filling along the length of each one, near the bottom edge, leaving 1.5cm at either end., Brush the exposed pasta with a damp brush, then roll up and pinch in the sides to seal and create cracker shapes., Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling to make 24 crackers in total. Transfer to semolina-dusted greaseproof paper as you go., For the sauce, melt the butter in a large frying pan, then, once foamy and starting to darken, squeeze in the clementine juice and swirl to create a creamy butter sauce. Season with pepper and keep warm over a very low heat until needed., Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water for 3 to 4 minutes, transferring it to the buttery sauce when cooked, with a splash of cooking water. Work in batches (the first will happily sit in the sauce while you cook the rest)., Finish with a grating of nutmeg and Parmesan, and a scattering of toasted, crushed almonds."

the seeds. Peel the onions and garlic, and deseed the peppers. Chop the squash, onions and peppers into 1cm dice. Finely chop the garlic with the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves)., Place it all in a pan on a medium-low heat with 2 tablespoons of oil, the chilli flakes, fennel and cumin seeds, and the ground coriander. Sweat with a lid on for 25 to 30 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, stirring occasionally., Destone the dates and finely chop the flesh with the apricots and coriander leaves. Fold into the veg pan with the drained pearl barley, squeeze in the lemon juice, season to perfection, then leave to cool., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Lay out two clean damp tea towels on a large work surface, side-by-side, with the longest edges facing you. Working quickly but taking care, lay out 3 sheets of filo side-by-side with the short edges towards you, overlapping each one by 2.5cm and brushing between the overlaps with water., Lightly brush the sheets with oil, place 3 filo sheets directly on top, then repeat with another 3 sheets. Save the remaining sheet for patching up., As evenly as possible, spoon your filling in a line along the long edge closest to you. Brush the opposite long edge with a little oil., Now, I’d recommend finding a friend to help you roll it up. Working slowly and carefully, use the tea towels to help you roll it up and away from you into a giant cigar, keeping it on the damp tea towel at all times. Roll it into a large pinwheel, working quickly but handling it gently to avoid too many cracks., Gently slide it onto a large greased baking tray, and patch up any gaps, if needed. Brush all over with more oil and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until gorgeous, crisp and golden., Ten minutes before the end, smash and sprinkle over the pistachios and an extra pinch of each of the spices, if you like., Serve with a super-light dusting of icing sugar. Delicious with all the usual trimmings, or served with a spiced tomato sauce."

to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Lightly grease a deep, 25cm loose-bottomed tart tin., To make the pastry, chop the butter into 1cm cubes and place in a food processor with the flour, icing sugar and a good pinch of sea salt., Halve the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds and add to the food processor, then pulse to fine crumbs. Crack in the egg, add a splash of milk, then pulse until it forms a rough dough., Pat and bring the dough together into a round, then wrap in clingfilm and pop in the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour., For the filling, quarter and deseed the squash, place on a  baking tray, then add a generous grating of nutmeg. Sprinkle over the ginger and cinnamon, drizzle with the maple syrup, then cover the tray tightly with a double layer of tin foil and bake 1 hour, or until soft. Leave to cool., Reduce the oven temperature to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., On a clean flour-dusted surface, roll out the pastry until it’s around ½cm thick, then loosely roll up around the rolling pin and unroll over the tart tin, easing it in and pushing it carefully into the sides., Trim off any excess pastry, patch up any holes, then prick the base with a fork, cover and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes (use any leftover pastry to make a few cheeky mince pies)., When the time’s up, line the pastry case with quality clingfilm (non-PVC), then fill with rice, making sure you pack it right out to the sides. Bake blind for 10 minutes, remove the clingfilm and rice and bake for a further 10 minutes, or until lightly golden, then leave to cool., Scoop the squash flesh and any bits from the tray into the food processor, add the sugar and maple syrup and whiz until smooth., Melt the butter and pour into the processor, then crack in the eggs and pulse to combine. Fill the cooled pastry case almost to the top with the mix and bake for 25 minutes., Meanwhile, make the topping. Place the pecans into the food processor (give it a quick rinse first) and pulse until roughly chopped, Add the butter, flour, sugar and maple syrup, then pulse to a rough crumb., When the time’s up, remove the tart from the oven, sprinkle over the topping, then bake for a further 20 minutes, or until golden. Leave to cool before slicing., Delicious served with a dollop of boozy cream. I sometimes like to decorate my pie with extra toasted pecans, just before serving, too."

Once cool enough to handle, halve and deseed, then scoop half the soft flesh into a bowl to cool (you only need half here, so keep the remaining roasted squash for another recipe)., Meanwhile, to make the pastry, sieve the flour and icing sugar on to a clean work surface. Cube the cold butter, then use your thumbs and fingertips to rub it into the flour and sugar until you end up with a fine, crumbly mixture., Beat 2 eggs and the milk and add to the mixture, then gently work it together until you have a ball of dough – don’t work it too much at this stage as you want to keep it crumbly and short., Flour your clean work surface, pat the dough into a flat round, flour it lightly, wrap in clingfilm and pop it into the fridge for at least half an hour., Lightly grease two 12-hole muffin tins with butter., Add the mincemeat and maple syrup to the bowl of cooled squash, then chop and add the almonds and mix together., Roll out the pastry on a clean flour-dusted surface to 3mm thick. Use a 10cm pastry cutter to cut out 24 circles of dough, then ease and press them into your prepared tins., Equally divide up the filling, then cut out 8cm circles from your leftover pastry to top the pies, crimping the edges together as you go. You can also add pastry shapes to decorate, depending on how many offcuts you have., Brush the tops of the pies with beaten egg, also using it to help you stick on any pastry decorations you’ve cut out., Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the middle of the oven, or until golden. Leave to cool and firm up for 10 minutes in the tins, then carefully transfer to a wire cooling rack., Dust lightly from a height with icing sugar and serve. Lovely hot with a drizzle of custard, or warm or cold with a cup of tea. You can also box them up for another day, and they’re great as a gift, too."

Use a spoon to score and scoop some flesh out, making a gully for the stuffing all along the length of the squash., Finely chop the scooped-out flesh with the seeds and put into a frying pan on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil., Peel, finely chop and add the onion and garlic, stirring regularly while you pick the sage leaves and finely chop them with the sun-dried tomatoes and chestnuts., Stir into the pan with the rice, cranberries and allspice, add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper and a swig of red wine, and mix well. Fry for 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Pack the mixture tightly into the gully in the two squash halves, then press the halves firmly back together. Rub the skin of the squash with a little oil, salt and pepper, and if you’ve got them, pat on any extra herb leaves you have to hand., Place the squash in the centre of a double layer of tin foil, then tightly wrap it up. Bake for around 2 hours, or until soft and cooked through., Once ready, take the squash to the table and open up the foil in front of everyone, then carve into nice thick slices and serve with all the usual trimmings."

Remove and reserve the seeds. Cut each half into quarters and lay the pieces in a roasting tray., Scrub, then quarter the larger beetroots and halve the smaller ones, then add to the tray. Peel and slice the onion into sixths and tuck in among the other veg., Remove the fronds from the fennel, popping them in cold water for later, then cut each bulb into 6 wedges and add to the tray. Drizzle with a little olive oil., In a pestle and mortar pound the coriander seeds with a good pinch each of sea salt and black pepper. Sprinkle this over all the vegetables on the tray and toss to coat., Roast the vegetables for about 40 minutes, shaking halfway through, until soft and golden and just starting to caramelise. Allow to cool slightly., Meanwhile, make your dressing by combining the vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, mustard and seasoning in a small jug or jam jar. Mix well., Dress the roasted veg while still warm so they soak up all the dressing, then pick and sprinkle over the herb leaves,  and reserved fennel tops., Cut the pomegranate in half and whack the back of each half with a wooden spoon to release the seeds, then add to the vegetables. Crumble over the feta, then gently toss everything together."

egg","Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Peel and finely slice the garlic, pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves, discarding the stalks. Peel and slice the onions, and slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways, roughly 5mm thick., Peel and cut the squash into 5mm slices, then place on an oven tray, season and drizzle over 3 tablespoons of oil. Roast on the top shelf of the oven for 35 minutes, or until soft, adding the garlic and rosemary after 20 minutes., Put the whole peppers on a second tray and place on the lower shelf of the oven for 35 minutes, or until blackened. Tip them into a bowl, cover with clingfilm and set aside for 10 minutes., Peel and discard the skins of the peppers, deseed, then slice the flesh into large pieces. Season, then place in a colander to drain., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan over a medium heat and sweat the onions for 10 to 12 minutes, or until just caramelised. Stir in the balsamic and sugar and cook for another 5 minutes., Place a griddle pan over a medium-high heat. Brush the aubergine and courgette slices with oil and place on the hot griddle for 5 minutes, until soft and lightly charred (do this in batches). Turn and season them halfway through, then transfer to a plate. Set aside., Fill and boil the kettle. Put the spinach in a colander and pour over the boiling water to wilt it. Let it cool, then squeeze it dry, chop it up and pop it into a bowl., Add the ricotta to the spinach, then finely grate in the lemon zest and half the Parmesan. Season, stir to combine and set aside., Reduce the oven temperature to 180ºC/350°F/gas 4 and grease and flour a 23cm spring-form cake tin., On a floured surface, roll out 420g of the pastry, so it fits the base and sides of the tin. Carefully press the pastry into the tin, leaving a little overhang, and trim off any excess., Pick the basil leaves. Sprinkle half the basil and half of the remaining Parmesan over the pastry base, then layer up the veg. Begin with the courgettes and aubergines followed by a layer of the peppers, then the spinach. Spoon over the squash and onions, dot over pieces of the goat’s cheese, then scatter on the rest of the basil and Parmesan., Beat and brush the egg around the edge of the pie. Roll out the rest of the pastry, place it on top and crimp the edges with your fingers to seal. Poke a hole in the pastry top and brush with the beaten egg., Bake the pie in the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden, covering the top with kitchen foil for the last 10 minutes if it looks too dark., Leave the pie to cool in the tin on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then take it out of the tin to cool completely. Serve hot or cold."

powder, bicarbonate of soda and cinnamon. Add a good grating of nutmeg, and set aside., Purée the cooked pumpkin or squash, then whisk with the buttermilk in a jug. Melt and add the chocolate, followed by the vanilla extract. Set aside., Using an electric whisk, cream the butter and both sugars in a separate bowl until fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, whisking continuously, then fold in half the flour until combined, followed by half the buttermilk liquid. Repeat until everything is mixed in., Pour the batter into the loaf tin, then bake it in the oven for 1 hour, or until golden and a skewer inserted comes out clean. Remove it from the oven and cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then take it out and cool on a wire rack., While the cake is cooling, make the icing. Peel and finely grate the ginger, then place in a bowl. Finely grate the clementine zest and put aside. Squeeze the clementine juice into the bowl, then beat in the icing sugar to make a thick but spoonable topping. Pour over the warm cake, sprinkle on the zest and serve."

Remove to piece of kitchen paper to drain, reserving the oil., Lay the cooked squash on a board, remove the stalks and, using a knife and tongs, carefully slice the squash lengthways, down the middle. Scoop out and discard the seeds., Finely chop the chilli and crumble the chestnuts, then sprinkle over the squash halves with the cinnamon and a good pinch of black pepper. Really mash and chop all the lovely toppings into the squash with your knife, so all the flavours go right through., Serve the squash halves topped with the crisp sage, the toasted pine nuts, a drizzle of the reserved sage oil and a little balsamic vinegar (if using)."

Cut squash into even chunks and cook in a pan of boiling salted water for about 30 minutes, until soft (to check, insert a knife into the flesh). Drain in a colander, and allow to steam dry for a few minutes., Preheat the oven to 190ºC/gas 5. While the squash is cooking, ask the kids to untwist the sausage links, then shape into 2 coils. Get them to pick and poke sage leaves into the sausage coils at intervals. Stick wooden skewers through the coils to keep them intact., When it’s cooled a little, the children can mash the squash with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, the butter, cumin and a good grating of nutmeg, then season with sea salt and black pepper, to taste., Cut the apples into wedges, then pop the sausages and apples on a baking tray with any extra sage leaves – and the seeds from the squash, if you like. Drizzle with olive oil, then bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the sausages are golden and crispy, and the apples golden and soft. Cut the sausages into wedges and serve with the roasted apples, the squash mash, gravy or chutney, and some steamed green beans or broccolini."

In a large roasting tray, toss and massage it with 1 teaspoon of oil, the ground coriander and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Deseed the peppers and cut into 3cm chunks, then, in a separate tray, toss and massage them with 1 teaspoon of oil and the smoked paprika. Place both trays in the oven for 35 minutes, or until softened., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop ¼ of an onion and put aside, then roughly chop the rest and place in a large casserole pan on a low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Crush in the garlic, add the bay leaves and a good splash of water and cook for 20 minutes, or until soft, stirring regularly., Tip in the beans, juice and all, then half-fill each empty tin with water, swirl and pour into the pan. Simmer until the time is up on the squash and peppers, then stir both into the pan., Trim, finely slice and add the okra, and simmer for a further 20 minutes, or until the feijoada is dark and delicious, loosening with an extra splash of water, if needed., Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the packet instructions, then drain., To make a quick salsa, deseed the tomatoes, then finely chop with as much chilli as you like and most of the coriander leaves. Scrape into a bowl with the reserved finely chopped onion and toss with the lime juice, then season to perfection., Remove 4 portions of feijoada, bag them up and once completely cool, freeze for a rainy day, when you’ll be really grateful it’s there., Serve the remaining feijoada with the rice and salsa, a spoonful of yoghurt and a sprinkling of the remaining coriander leaves."

Line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases or 15cm folded squares of greaseproof paper, then lightly wipe each one with oiled kitchen paper., Peel the sweet potatoes or squash and coarsely grate into a large bowl. Trim the spring onions, then finely slice with the chilli and add to the bowl, reserving half the chilli to one side., Crack in the eggs, add the cottage cheese and flour, then finely grate in most of the Parmesan and season with sea salt and black pepper. Mix until nicely combined., Evenly divide the muffin mixture between the cases. Sprinkle over the sunflower and poppy seeds, then dot over the reserved slices of chilli., Use the remaining Parmesan to give a light dusting of cheese over each one, then bake at the bottom of the oven for 45 to 50 minutes (if using squash, it’ll be a bit quicker – check after 35 minutes), or until golden and set., These are amazing served warm 5 minutes after taking them out of the oven, and good kept in the fridge for a couple of days.

Finely slice the pancetta, shallots and chilli, then chop the squash into 1cm cubes. Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the pancetta and fry for 1 minute, then stir in the shallots, chilli and rosemary leaves. Cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes, then stir in the squash and pour in the hot stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 20 minutes, or until the squash is tender and the liquid has reduced slightly., Meanwhile, cook the penne in a large pan of boiling salted water until very al dente – it’ll continue cooking in the sauce so it’s important to undercook it. Reserving some of the cooking water, drain the penne and add to the sauce. Stir gently, adding a splash of the cooking water to loosen, if needed, then cook for a further 2 minutes to let the penne soak up all those beautiful flavours. Finely grate in the Parmesan and stir until deliciously creamy. Serve with a twist of pepper and an extra grating of Parmesan."

Add the pastina or break in the spaghetti/linguine, then stir through the soup, adding a splash more water to loosen if the soup is quite thick because the pasta will absorb the water., Place on the hob for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked through., Serve with good grating of Parmesan cheese (not for your baby, and only a little for toddlers)."

chilli","Preheat the oven to 190°C/375ºF/gas 5. Line a shallow baking tin (roughly 22cm x 32cm) with greaseproof paper., Carefully halve the squash, scoop out and discard the seeds (there’s no need to peel it), then chop into rough 3cm wedges. Place into a large roasting tray with a splash of olive oil, the chilli flakes and a small pinch of salt and pepper. Toss to coat., Bash and add the garlic cloves to the tray, then pop in the hot oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until tender., Meanwhile, place a frying pan over a medium heat, then add the almonds, fennel seeds and a pinch of salt. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden (keep an eye on them!), then bash well in a pestle and mortar., Take the squash out of the oven (keep the oven on for later). Scoop the flesh into a food processor and discard the skin. Squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins, add to the processor, then whiz to a smooth purée., Separate the egg yolks from the whites into two large bowls. Grate the Parmesan over the yolks, then stir in the squash purée, flour, a good grating of nutmeg and a pinch of salt and pepper., Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks in a separate bowl then carefully fold it into the squash mixture. Transfer to the lined tin, spreading it out evenly. Bake for 14 to 15 minutes, or until set and springy., Meanwhile, heat a splash of olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then add the spinach and cook for around 2 minutes until wilted. Leave to cool, squeeze out the excess moisture, then finely chop., Turn out the roulade onto a large piece of greaseproof paper. Carefully peel away and discard the top layer of greaseproof paper., Crumble the goat’s cheese into a bowl, then add the ricotta, lemon zest and juice. Deseed, finely chop and add the chilli, stir well, then season to taste with sea salt and black pepper., Spread the mixture over the sponge, leaving a rough 2cm gap along one of the longest edges. Scatter over the spinach and one-third of the almonds., Starting at the longest edge with no filling, carefully roll up the sponge, using the greaseproof paper to help you., Scatter over the remaining nuts, then carve into thick slices and serve straight away with a fresh green salad."

seeds, paprika and 1 teaspoon each of sea salt and black pepper in a pestle and mortar., Carefully cut the squash in half lengthways, deseed, then chop into 4cm chunks. Toss with half the spice mixture and a drizzle of olive oil on a baking tray., Roast for 50 minutes, or until golden, then remove from the oven and reduce the temperature to 150°C/300°F/gas 2., Meanwhile, drizzle both cuts of meat with olive oil and rub with the remaining spice mixture, then place a large casserole pan (at least 30cm wide, 8cm deep) on a medium-high heat., Put the pork and brisket into the pan fat side down and brown on all sides for around 15 minutes in total. Remove both meats to a plate and reduce the heat under the pan to medium., Peel and roughly chop the onions and add to the fat in the pan. Fry for 10 minutes, or until lightly caramelized, stirring regularly., Add the balsamic and the porcini liquor (discarding just the last gritty bit). Roughly chop and add the porcini, followed by the beans (juice and all), then scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands., Return both meats to the pan, loosen with a splash of water if needed, then bring to the boil. Season, and sit a layer of wet greaseproof paper directly on the surface. Cover with tin foil and cook in the oven for 5 hours, or until the meat is tender., Prick the peppers and chillies, then blacken all over in a griddle pan or directly over the flame of a gas hob. Place in a bowl, cover and leave to cool, then peel and deseed them, keeping as much juice as you can for extra flavour. Roughly chop with half the coriander, and toss with a little salt and pepper., When the meat is tender, remove from the oven, break up the meat, then stir in the squash, peppers and chillies. Adjust the consistency with water, if needed, taste and season to perfection, and keep warm., To finish, make the salsa. Peel the onion, then finely chop with the apples and the remaining coriander. Dress with the cider vinegar and extra virgin olive oil and season to perfection., Serve the chilli with the salsa. Also good with bread or rice, and yoghurt."

well, with sea salt and black pepper. Place it in a tray and roast in the preheated oven for around 2 hours, turning it every now and then. Halfway through, you’ll probably need to drain away a lot of the fat from the bird. Don't throw it away, though! Sieve it and keep the fat (but no meat juices) in a jar in the fridge for a couple of months and use it to roast potatoes., In a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker, bash up the dried chillies and coriander seeds and add the ground cinnamon and a good pinch of salt and pepper., Scoop the seeds out of your squash and put them to one side. Cut the squash into wedges, place them in a roasting tray, and drizzle over enough olive oil just to coat. Sprinkle over the ground spices and give the squash a good toss, spreading the pieces out in one layer., Once the duck has been in the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, add the tray of squash to the oven and roast for about 45 minutes., Meanwhile, rinse the squash seeds after removing any fibres. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Toast them in a dry frying pan until they’re golden and crisp, and put aside., To make the dressing, put the lime juice and zest into a bowl and add the same amount of extra virgin olive oil, plus the sesame oil and the soy sauce. Stir in the sugar, chilli, garlic, the green spring onion ends and coriander stalks. Taste and adjust the sweet-and-sourness and the seasoning. You want it to be a little limey, to contrast with the rich duck., After 2 hours, if the duck is nice and crispy, and the squash soft and sticky, take both trays out of the oven. If they need more time, leave them in until perfectly done. Using two forks, shred the duck meat off the bone and put into a large bowl., While the duck and squash are still warm, toss with the toasted seeds, half the coriander leaves, half the mint and half the white spring onion slices. Pour on the dressing and toss together. Serve sprinkled with the rest of the coriander, mint and white spring onion slices."

                               milk","Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Slice the squash lengthways into wedges and add to a large roasting tray with a good splash of olive oil, the chilli and cinnamon. Bash the coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar until fine, then add the rosemary leaves and bash again for 1 to 2 minutes to release its flavour. Scatter over the squash and toss together so that each piece of squash is well coated with the seasoning. Make sure all the squash is skin-side down, then cover with tin foil and bake in the hot oven for around 45 minutes or until soft. Allow to cool, then tear into bite-sized chunks., Meanwhile, heat a saucepan over a medium heat, then add a splash of olive oil and the onions. Season well with salt and pepper and cook gently, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned. Add the sage and crumbled chestnuts to the pan for the last few minutes of cooking., While that’s happening, toast the bread on a hot griddle pan or in a toaster and rub well with one of the cloves of garlic. Tear into small chunks, and once the onions are done, add the toast to the pan. Turn the heat off, stir everything together, taste, then season and grate in the zest of the lemon., Add the butter to a frying pan on a medium heat and when melted, add the mushrooms and a chopped clove of garlic. Fry until soft and quite dry. Squeeze in a little lemon juice, tip into a food processor and whiz until smooth., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the spinach and cook until soft. Drain in a colander, pressing lightly to get rid of excess moisture, then place to one side., Slice the remaining garlic clove and add to a frying pan with a splash of olive oil. Fry until golden. Add the pine nuts, sultanas and spinach and fry everything together until warmed through. Season well with salt and pepper and turn off the heat., Now assemble your Wellington. Roll out the puff pastry on a sheet of baking parchment until it’s about 30cm x 40cm, then spread the mushroom mixture all over it. In a large bowl, lightly toss together the spinach, squash and onion-bread mixture, then spoon it in a thick line down the middle of the pastry. Leave a space free at either side so you can roll the pastry around the filling., To do this, hold one side of the baking parchment and lift it, with the pastry, towards the centre of the Wellington so it starts to cover the filling. Peel the baking parchment back, leaving the pastry in place, then do the same with the other side. The pastry should overlap in the middle. Beat the egg with the milk and brush it over the pastry join to seal the join. Fold up the ends so the filling doesn’t leak out, then carefully roll the Wellington onto a baking sheet, with the seal underneath. Brush all over with the egg mix., Bake for 45 minutes until puffed up, golden brown and hot through. Serve carved into thick chunks – it’s fantastic served with veggie gravy!"

Leave to cool., For the dressing, squeeze the lemon juice into a jam jar, top up with the same amount of extra virgin olive oil, then season with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper. Secure the lid and give it a good shake., Place a griddle pan over a medium heat. Cut the ciabatta into 2.5cm slices and toast on the griddle until golden., Halve the garlic clove, then rub the ciabatta all over with the cut side. Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, then spread over the leftover stuffing., Shred the chicken, then place into a large bowl. Trim and roughly slice the lettuce, then add to the bowl with the rocket and most of the seeds and chickpeas., Chop or tear the roasted squash into nice chunks, add these to the bowl and drizzle over the dressing. Toss gently then transfer to a large platter. Scatter over the remaining seeds and chickpeas., Drizzle the ciabatta with a little more extra virgin olive oil. Pick, finely chop and  sprinkle over the parsley, and serve alongside the salad."

harissa paste, extra virgin olive oil","Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Place the squash, cumin and crumbled chilli on to a baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil, mix together and place in the preheated oven. Roast for 45 minutes until the squash is cooked through., Once the squash is roasted, heat a large saucepan and pour in a splash of oil. Add the celery, garlic, parsley stalks and two-thirds of the onion, and cook gently with a lid on until softened. Drop in the roasted squash and let it sweat for a few minutes, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the chickpeas and simmer for 15 minutes more., Meanwhile, toast the reserved squash seeds with the almond flakes, fennel, sesame and poppy seeds in a little olive oil until they are nicely coloured all over., Season the soup well and, using a hand-held blender, whiz for a few seconds so it thickens, but there are still some chunky bits. Keep warm while you mix together the lemon zest, chopped parsley leaves and mint leaves. Chop the remaining onion until it’s really fine, then mix into the zesty mixture., To serve, spoon half a teaspoon of harissa paste into each bowl. Divide the zesty herb mixture between the bowls and ladle over the soup. Stir each bowl once with a spoon, then sprinkle with the toasted seeds and almonds and finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

It looks wicked in little tea cups with chilli, coriander and fresh coconut sprinkled on the top., Roughly chop the squash into big chunks, then set aside. Whiz the lime leaves, if using, 3 of the chillies, the garlic, ginger, lemongrass, coriander stalks, Chinese five spice and cumin to a dryish paste in a food processor. Discard the stringy bits, if any., Heat the oil in a deep saucepan over a medium-low heat. Add the spice paste and onion and cook gently for about 10 minutes, stirring to release the flavours. Add the squash and stock, and stir around, scraping all the goodness off the bottom of the pan. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, with the lid on, for about 15 minutes, until the squash is soft and cooked., Pour in the rice and give it a really good stir – the squash might begin to break up, but it doesn’t matter. Continue to simmer, covered, for 12 minutes, until the rice is just cooked., Add the coconut milk, stir again, taste and season carefully. Bring back to a simmer, then add the lime juice, to taste. Spoon into tea or coffee cups and decorate with the fresh coriander leaves, the remaining sliced chilli and some shaved fresh coconut, if using."

You may have tried a Parma ham, rocket and Parmesan salad with a little balsamic, but by adding warm roasted squash and trying it with pecorino, which is slightly smoother than Parmesan, it’s a real pleasure and even feels a bit posh., Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Carefully cut your butternut squash in half, keeping the seeds intact. Remove the two ends and discard them. Cut each half into quarters and lay in a roasting tray. Rub with a little olive oil. In a pestle and mortar pound up a flat teaspoon each of salt, pepper and your chilli and coriander seeds. Scatter this over the squash. Roast the squash for half an hour or until soft and golden. Allow to cool a little., Lay your prosciutto on 4 plates — let it hang over the rim of the plates and encourage it to twist and turn so it doesn’t look neat and flat. Tear up your warm squash and put it in and around the ham. Sprinkle over the seeds and the rocket. Drizzle over the olive oil and balsamic, add a tiny pinch of salt and pepper, and use a vegetable peeler to shave over the Pecorino. Easily done."

Deseed and finely chop the chilli. Pick and finely chop the rosemary., Heat a couple of lugs of olive oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat, add the sage leaves and fry for 30 seconds, or until crisp, then remove to kitchen paper., Place the pan of flavoured oil back on the heat, add the onion, carrot, garlic, celery, chilli, rosemary and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then cook gently for 10 minutes, or until sweet and soft., Meanwhile, halve, deseed and rough chop the squash. When the time's up, add the squash and stock to the pan. Bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes., For the croutons, drizzle a little olive oil over the ciabatta, pat it in, then finely grate and press some grated Parmesan on to each side. Place in a dry, non-stick pan and fry until golden on both sides., When the squash is tender, whiz the soup with a stick blender or pour it into a blender and pulse to a smooth purée – leave it slightly chunky, if you prefer., Season to perfection with salt and pepper, then divide between bowls, placing 2 croutons on top of each., Sprinkle with a few crispy sage leaves and drizzle with a swirl of quality extra virgin olive oil, then serve."

180°C/350°F/gas 4. Halve the squash, deseed, then cut into 8 slices or chunks (skin on) and put into a roasting tray. Bash up the dried chilli and a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar. Sprinkle over the squash, drizzle with olive oil and bake for 40 minutes., Finely chop or whiz the chillies, garlic, ginger and coriander stalks in a food processor. Add the sesame oil, lime juice, zest and fish sauce and whiz to a thin paste., Heat a large pan or wok. Pour in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and quickly stir in the paste. Cook for about a minute before adding the coconut milk and chicken stock., Turn the heat down and simmer for about 15 minutes. Taste – you may need to add fish sauce, lime juice or a bit of salt and pepper., Add the noodles to the soup, simmer for a few minutes, then divide between 4 bowls. Break over 2 pieces of squash. If you like, top with sliced red chilli and cress., Tip: For a quick fix, use a good laksa paste instead of making your own."

Pick through them and save a small handful, discarding the rest and picking off all the fleshy pulp. Add them to a small pan with a lug of olive oil and fry until golden. Keep to one side., In a pestle and mortar, bash the fennel and coriander seeds and dried chilli flakes with 1 teaspoon of sea salt and a pinch of black pepper until fine., Cut the squash halves into wedges and add to a roasting tray. Tip over the spices, then scatter over the cinnamon. Crumble the chestnuts directly into the tray, then drizzle lightly with olive oil. Toss to coat., Roast in the oven to cook for 30 to 45 minutes, or until beautiful, golden, and soft when you pinch it., When the squash is done, sprinkle over a little salt from a height and carefully tip the golden seeds into the tray, leaving the oil behind in the pan., Pick the rosemary leaves onto a board with a good pinch of salt and pepper and finely chop it all together. Roll the beef about on the board until it’s well coated in the rosemary., Return the pan of oil to a high heat, and once its screaming hot, add the beef. Sear it for 1 to 1½ minutes, so it browns, then turn it over and do the same on the other side. Remember you’re just searing it to get a bit of colour on the outside, not cooking it – it should be blue in the middle., Meanwhile, make the dressing. Add the mustard, 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice to a bowl or mortar and mix well. Have a little taste and check the seasoning then put aside., With a really sharp knife, slice the beef up as thinly as you can without hacking it up or ruining it! Go thicker to do it nicely if you need to. Use the back of a knife to carefully flatten out each slice of beef, then transfer them to a large platter., Sprinkle with a little salt, as the seasoning won’t have got through to the centre of the beef. Arrange the squash pieces over the top, then crumble over the roasted chestnuts and scatter over the seeds., Drizzle everything with a bit dressing (save any leftovers for another day), then lightly dress the salad leaves and pop these on the top. Take it to the table with a block of Parmesan for shaving over."

Even though it’s very Tuscan in style, the flavours remind me of English chutney recipes that I’ve come across in old cookbooks. When roasted like this, the squash is wonderful eaten as part of an antipasti plate, or in soups, or tossed with pasta, or with meat. Other types of squash that are great for roasting are onion squash (which has a dense orange skin) and acorn squash (which has an orangey-grey skin and is a bit more squashed than round). Ask your local fruit and veg man for guidance if you’re not sure.

Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Halve the butternut squash, remove and reserve the seeds, then cut the squash into slices or chunks with the skin left on. Using a pestle and mortar, or a metal bowl with a rolling pin, bash up the dried red chilli with a good pinch of salt. Add the whole sage leaves, the pieces of cinnamon and enough olive oil to loosen the mixture, and rub the whole lot over all the squash pieces so they are well covered., Place the squash in one layer in a roasting tray and season lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle over the seeds, cover tightly with tin foil and bake for 30 minutes, or until the skin of the squash is soft, then remove the foil and cook for another 10 minutes until the squash is golden and crisp. Remove the cinnamon and tuck in!"

Toss together. Very carefully cut a medium butternut squash into quarters. Remove the seeds and slice one quarter of the squash as finely as you can. Place the chicken breast and flavourings from the bowl into the tray and snugly fit your squash slices around the chicken. Carefully pour a little single cream around the squash (not on the chicken).

Carefully cut your butternut squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Put these to one side. Cut the squash lengthways into 0.5cm/¼ inch slices. Bash up your coriander and chillies with a pinch of salt and pepper in a pestle and mortar (or use a metal bowl and the end of a rolling pin). Dust this over your squash with a tablespoon of olive oil. Toss around until completely coated. Line up snugly in a roasting tray and bake for around 30 minutes until the flesh and skin are soft to the touch. Now get all your ingredients ready and start making your basic risotto., Remove the squash from the oven and lay your pancetta over it. Mix the squash seeds, chestnuts and sage leaves with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Sprinkle over the squash and pancetta and place back in the oven for about 5 to 10 minutes until the pancetta is crisp., Once the squash has cooled down a little, shake off the pancetta and chestnuts and finely chop the squash – it will be quite mushy but that’s fine. I go for half of it fine and half chunky. Add this to the risotto at the end of Stage 3. Carry on as normal through the basic recipe, season to taste and serve with the pancetta, chestnuts, sage leaves and squash seeds sprinkled over the top., Lovely served with a big dollop of mascarpone cheese on the side., Try this: Place a grater and a block of Parmesan cheese in the middle of the table so that everyone can help themselves."

Roll the pastry to the thickness of a pound coin. Get a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin, line with the pastry and bake blind for 20 minutes. Set aside., Lay the squash in a baking tray. Sprinkle with the nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon and drizzle with the maple syrup. Cover the tray tightly with a double layer of tinfoil and bake for 45 minutes until soft. Reduce the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Allow the pieces of squash to cool, then scoop out the flesh. You should have about 600g of cooked squash flesh. Don't forget to scrape out the bits in the tray and the maple syrup. Put in a food processor and whiz until smooth. Transfer to a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of the sugar and the eggs. Mix well and stir in the cream., Fill the cooled tart case with the mix and bake for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, wash the stringy bits of squash off the seeds, dry them and lay them flat on a tray. Sprinkle with the remaining sugar and place in the oven with the pie for the last 10 minutes until crispy., Remove the tart from the oven. Sprinkle with the seeds when cool. Serve with cream or ice cream, if you're feeling naughty."

What you want to do is delicately flavour the meat, so pound up the coriander seeds with the rosemary and a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar (or use a metal bowl and a rolling pin) until nice and fine. Take half this mixture and rub it over the inside of the lamb. Season it well with salt and pepper, then roll up the lamb and secure it with 4 or 5 pieces of string. The reason for doing this is to make the meat a consistent thickness – don't worry about doing it neatly, as long as it holds together it's fine., Put a high-sided roasting tray on the hob and brown the lamb on all sides in a little olive oil. Remove from the heat, allow the lamb to cool a little, then add the red onions to the tray. Lift up the lamb, stir the onions around to cover them in all the flavoursome juices, then sit the lamb back on top and cook in the preheated oven for around 2 hours, adding the cranberry juice after the first half an hour and turning the heat down to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3., Turn the meat in its cooking juices when you can. By the end of the 2 hours you want the meat to be nice and crisp on the outside but really melt-in-your-mouth and tender. Sometimes the lamb may need a little longer, depending on the age of the animal. You'll also want enough juice left in the bottom of the tray to give everyone a nice spoonful – if it looks as if the liquid is going to cook away too quickly, add a little water and place a cartouche on top. Skim off any fat that cooks out of the meat., While the lamb is cooking, rub the butternut squash with the rest of the spice mix and a drizzle of olive oil. Lay it in another roasting tray, season well and put it in the oven when the lamb's been cooking for just over an hour. Cook for around 45 minutes, until sweet and tender., When the lamb's cooked, let it rest for 10 minutes, then remove the string. In a bowl mix together the coriander leaves, spring onions, lemon juice, 4 tablespoons of olive oil and seasoning. Toss together., To serve, divide the squash between your plates, cut up the lamb into irregular sized slices, spoon over some tray juices, and sprinkle on the herb salad. A dollop of yoghurt on top is lovely."

heat to get nice and hot, and pour your stock into a small pan on a low heat to get warm. To make your fragrant soup base, add the lime leaves, chillies, garlic, ginger, lemongrass and a pinch of salt to a food processor. Chop the top few leaves off your bunch of coriander and pop to one side, then add the rest to the processor and blitz for 30 seconds or so until fairly fine. With the processor still running, add a few good lugs of olive oil, the five-spice and ground cumin. Tip this mixture straight into your hot pan, you can add a splash of stock to loosen it if you want, and fry and stir for a couple of minutes so it starts smelling fantastic. Add your sliced onion, then cook gently for 8 to 10 minutes., Add the squash to the pan and stir well, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until the squash is lovely and soft. At this point, add the rice and give it a really good stir. If it looks a bit dry, you can add a splash of water here. Continue to simmer for about 8 minutes until the rice is almost cooked, then add the coconut milk and bring back to the boil. Simmer for a couple of minutes until hot through and thickened a little. I like to squash up some of the squash at this point too., Take the pan off the heat, give it a good stir, then taste and season carefully with salt and pepper. To give it a bit of twang add the lime juice – the amount you need will depend on how juicy your limes are, so keep tasting it as you go. Scatter with more sliced fresh chilli and your reserved coriander leaves before serving., If you’re making this for a party, what I like to do is to hack the top off a massive pumpkin, scoop out the insides, then bake the shell in the oven for 40 minutes at 100ºC/220ºF/gas ¼. You can then use this as a receptacle for your hot soup, and as long as it’s an inch or so thick, it should keep warm for a good hour or so. Have it sitting out at the party with a load of little cups and bowls lined up next to it and a bunch of lime wedges, and let everyone help themselves!"

Chop the squash in half and scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon. Slice each half lengthways into 4 wedges and place in a bowl., Sprinkle over the chilli, coriander, nutmeg and cloves and a little salt and pepper. Toss with the sage leaves and a splash of oil, place on a roasting tray, then roast for 40 minutes or until softened, cooked through and lightly browned., Carefully cut the squash into large cubes, cutting away the skin, and tear the mozzarella up into similar-sized pieces. Thread a cocktail stick through a ring of chilli, then through a basil leaf folded in half, then through a piece of mozzarella and then finally into a chunk of squash., Repeat until all the bits of squash and mozzarella are used up, then drizzle with olive oil before serving."

Line your muffin tins with paper cases., Whiz the squash in a food processor until finely chopped. Add the sugar, and crack in the eggs. Add a pinch of salt, the flour, baking powder, walnuts, cinnamon and olive oil and whiz together until well beaten. You may need to pause the machine at some point to scrape the mix down the sides with a rubber spatula. Try not to overdo it with the mixing – you want to just combine everything and no more., Fill the paper cases with the cake mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Check to see whether they are cooked properly by sticking a wooden skewer or a knife right into one of the cakes – if it comes out clean, they’re done. If it’s a bit sticky, pop them back into the oven for a little longer. Remove from the oven and leave the cakes to cool on a wire rack., As soon as the muffins are in the oven, make your runny frosted topping. Place most of the clementine zest, all the lemon zest and the lemon juice in a bowl. Add the soured cream, icing sugar and vanilla seeds and mix well. Taste and have a think about it – adjust the amount of lemon juice or icing sugar to balance the sweet and sour. Put into the fridge until your cakes have cooled down, then spoon the topping on to the cakes., Serve on a lovely plate (or on a cake stand if you’re feeling elegant, or on a rustic slab if you’re more of a hunter-gatherer type!), with the rest of the clementine zest sprinkled over. For an interesting flavour and look, a few dried lavender flowers or rose petals are fantastic."

the spice rub, then cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge for a couple of hours, preferably overnight., When you’re ready to cook, peel and finely chop the onion, and pick the coriander leaves, finely chopping the stalks., Heat a generous lug of oil in a tagine or casserole pan over a medium heat, add the meat and fry for 5 minutes to seal. Add the onion and coriander stalks and fry for a further 5 minutes., Drain and tip in the chickpeas, followed by the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, then pour in 400ml of stock and stir well. Bring to the boil, then cover and reduce to a low heat for 1½ hours., Meanwhile, deseed and chop the squash into 5cm chunks, then destone and roughly tear the prunes. Toast the almonds in a dry frying pan until lightly golden, then tip into a bowl., When the time's up, add the squash, prunes and remaining stock. Give everything a gentle stir, then pop the lid back on and continue cooking for another 1½ hours. Keep an eye on it, adding splashes of water, if needed., At this stage, remove the lid and check the consistency. If it seems a bit too runny, simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, more with the lid off – the beef should be really tender and flaking apart now, so have a taste and season to taste., Scatter the coriander leaves over the tagine along with the toasted almonds. Serve with a big bowl of lightly seasoned couscous and dive in."

baby spinach","Start by making a temper. Peel the garlic, then finely slice with the chillies, ideally 1mm thick on a mandolin (use the guard!)., Pour 2 tablespoons of oil into a large wide pan on a medium heat and add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and curry leaves for 1 minute, then the garlic and chillies., Stir so everything’s flat, moving regularly until crisp and lightly golden. With a slotted spoon, remove half the temper to a plate, taking the pan off the heat., Peel the onions and ginger and finely chop with the coriander stalks, then chop the squash into 2cm cubes, leaving the skin on but discarding any seeds. Stir it all into the pan and return to a medium heat for 15 minutes to soften., Stir in the lentils, then 1.5 litres of boiling water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer and cover for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally., Mash the squash into the daal, taste and season to perfection. Remove 6 portions, bag them up and, once completely cool, freeze for a rainy day when you’ll be really grateful it’s there, leaving the rest on a low heat to keep warm., Blitz the coriander leaves, yoghurt, a pinch of sea salt and half the lime juice in a blender until smooth, then decant into a small bowl., Reheat the reserved temper in a non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat with 1 teaspoon of oil, then divide into two piles and crack an egg over each. Cover and leave to slowly fry on the bottom for 2 or 3 minutes, while they coddle on top., One-by-one, puff up your dry poppadoms in the microwave for around 30 seconds each., Top each portion of daal with a fried egg, and pop some spinach, dressing, poppadoms and a lime wedge on the side."

Place a large ovenproof casserole pan on a medium heat., Finely slice the pancetta, pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves, then place both in the pan with 1 tablespoon of oil and the bay leaves. Stir regularly for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, followed by the onion and leek. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, chop the squash or sweet potato (wash first) into bite-sized chunks, leaving the skin on and discarding any squash seeds., I like to cut the stalk and face off the mushrooms because it looks nice – just add the trimmings straight to the pan, along with the whole mushrooms and chopped squash or sweet potato., Remove and discard the chicken skin and add the chicken to the pan. Pour in the wine and let it reduce slightly, then add the tomatoes and break them up with a wooden spoon., Half-fill each tin with water, swirl about, pour into the pan and mix it all together. Destone the olives, then poke them into the stew., Bring to a gentle simmer, then transfer to the oven to cook for 1 hour, or until thick, delicious, the chicken falls off the bone and the squash or sweet potato is lovely and tender., Season to perfection, then serve with bread to mop up that tasty sauce."
