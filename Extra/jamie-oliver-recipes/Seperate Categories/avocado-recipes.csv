Crush 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds in a pestle and mortar. Scrub 2 small sweet potatoes and rub with the crushed cumin seeds. Place in a roasting tray and cook in the oven for 30 minutes., Meanwhile, trim the tough end off 1 broccoli stalk, slice it, then chop the rest into large florets. Toss the broccoli into the sweet potato tray with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Roast for another 30 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are cooked through., Toast 25g of cashew nuts and 25g of mixed pumpkin, sunflower and sesame seeds in a dry frying pan on a medium heat until smelling fantastic, then crush in the pestle and mortar., Bash and mush up 250g of vac-packed beetroot in their pack as much as you can, then snip the corner off and decant into a bowl with 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Mix together, mashing with a fork, if needed., Cook 300g of quinoa according to the packet instructions, and drain well. Pick and finely chop the leaves from 1 bunch of mint (reserving the pretty ones for garnish) and stir through the quinoa with the finely grated zest and the juice from 1 lemon, then season to perfection., Scatter the quinoa across a large platter. Once cool enough to handle, tear over chunks of roasted sweet potato and dot over the roasted broccoli. Halve 1 ripe avocado and use a teaspoon to add curls of flesh to the platter.

Remove the pan from the heat, keeping the bowl over the pan., Meanwhile, halve and destone the avocados and scoop out the flesh into a food processor. (Try to remove as much of the flesh as possible, but a little left in the shell is fine)., You’ll now have four empty avocado skin halves. Using a clean pastry brush, brush the inside of the avocado shells with a layer of melted chocolate until evenly covered. Transfer to a tray and place in the fridge for 10 minutes until set. Repeat this process two more times, until you’ve applied three layers of chocolate. Return the tray to the fridge for half an hour, or until set completely., Meanwhile, place the pan and bowl back on a low-medium heat, snap in the remaining dark chocolate and leave to melt., Once melted, add the chocolate to the food processor with the cocoa powder, vanilla bean paste, maple syrup, coconut cream and a pinch of salt, and pulse for a few seconds to combine. Scrape down the sides with a spatula, then pulse again, until smooth. Scrape into a bowl, cover and leave in the fridge until needed (but no longer than 2 hours)., Once the chocolate shells are set, gently peel the avocado skins away from the shells and discard. Heat a tablespoon in a jug of boiling water for a few seconds., Now it’s time to get a bit creative with your presentation: using the hot spoon, roll up 1 tablespoon of the chocolate mousse for each serving plate (you will end up with about half of the chocolate mixture leftover, please see tip below). Press the chocolate shells onto the mousse, filling each with a little fruit (I used halved strawberries and blueberries, orange segments and a couple of amarena cherries). Drizzle with a little of the cherry liquor, and some melted and grated white chocolate to finish, if you like."

Blitz until smooth, then pour back into the jar., Finely chop the chilli (if using) and place in a shallow bowl. Crack in one of the eggs, add a pinch of black pepper and whisk together with a fork., Soak the crumpet in the chilli and egg mixture for a couple of minutes, pressing it down and turning halfway., Meanwhile, make a quick salsa: Halve, destone, peel and roughly chop the avocado and quarter the tomatoes. Place everything in a small bowl, drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil and season to perfection. Add the reserved mint leaves and gently mix., Place the bacon in a dry non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat and leave to crisp up a little, turning every so often., Push the bacon to one side and finely grate the Parmesan cheese into the pan in a pile slightly larger than the diameter of your crumpet. Press the soaked crumpet topside down onto the cheese and pour over any remaining egg mixture, then cook for 2 minutes, until the Parmesan is golden and crispy., Carefully loosen the edges of the Parmesan with a spatula, then lift up the crumpet, pulling the Parmesan with it. Hold for a few seconds so it sets, then turn it back over into the pan, leaving you with a crispy crown on the top., Crack in the remaining egg alongside and cook to your liking., Transfer the crowned crumpet to a plate, top with the salsa and spoon some of the jalapeño dressing on the side with the crispy bacon. Top with the fried egg and serve."

Destone, peel and roughly chop the mango. Scoop out the avocado and finely slice. Trim and finely slice the spring onions., Carefully cut the skin off the salmon and place it in a non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat to crisp up on both sides., Pat the Cajun seasoning all over the salmon fillets, then fry for 5 minutes, turning to get them golden on each of their sides. Once the skin is crispy, move it to sit on top of the salmon., Meanwhile, use tongs to toast the tortillas directly over the flame of your gas hob for 15 seconds, or use a hot pan., Sprinkle the mango, avocado and spring onions over the tortillas, then flake over the salmon and crack over the skin., Toss the tomatoes and the juice of 1 lime in the residual heat of the pan for 30 seconds, then spoon over the tortillas. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over."

Cook on one side only for 2 minutes, or until lightly golden, then stack up on a serving plate and repeat., Top each pancake with dollops of cottage cheese, the avocado salad, and a few good shakes of chilli sauce. Really nice served with extra lime wedges for squeezing over, and a fried egg on top, if you fancy."

Do the same with 100g of radishes and 4 ripe tomatoes, halving the tomatoes first., Place the bashed salad veg (juices and all) into a bowl, drizzle over 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, then season to taste with sea salt and black pepper. Pick and tear in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh coriander (15g), then toss everything together., Place a large frying pan over a medium heat to warm up while you trim and finely slice 8 spring onions, grate 30g of Cheddar and mash the sweet potato (leaving the skin on)., Place 1 tortilla into the pan, sprinkle over half the cheese and spring onions, then top with all the sweet potato., Add a good few shakes of chipotle Tabasco sauce, scatter over the remaining spring onions and cheese, then top with the remaining tortilla, pressing down slightly., Carefully flip the tortilla and continue cooking for 1 further minute, or until golden and crisp. Slide onto a board and cut into 8 wedges., Destone ½ a ripe avocado (if needed), drizzle over 1 teaspoon each of extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar, then place on the board., Put 2 heaped tablespoons of natural yoghurt into a small bowl, and swirl through a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a few dashes of chipotle Tabasco., Serve the quesadilla wedges with the salad, avo and dollops of yoghurt. Slice ½ a lime into wedges for squeezing over, then get stuck in."

Place over a medium heat, until hot but not boiling., Remove from the heat. Season and sift in the flour. Beat it in with a wooden spoon until smooth, then scoop it into a bowl and set aside until just cool enough to handle., To make the filling, finely chop the cooked chicken and mozzarella.  Deseed and finely chop the tomatoes, then pick and finely chop the parsley leaves (keep the stalks for another day – they’re perfect in the base of a ragù or soup). Trim and finely slice the spring onions., Mix everything together in a large bowl. Finely grate in the zest of 1 lime and season to taste., Make the avocado dressing by roughly blitzing the flesh of all the avocados, the juice of both limes, a drizzle of olive oil and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Stir in a drizzle of chilli sauce and leave to one side., When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a well-floured work surface and knead it for 10 minutes, until silky and smooth. Place a ball of dough in the palm of your floured hand, around the size of a golf ball, and flatten it out into a circle, around 7cm in diameter., Spoon in a heaped teaspoon of the chicken filling, then bring the edges together over the chicken and shape it into a small, pear-like pyramid. Keep going until you’ve used up all the dough and filling, lining the coxinhas on a baking tray as you go., To cook them, fill a saucepan with vegetable oil and leave it to heat up over a medium heat. Lay out three shallow dishes: mix the breadcrumbs and paprika in one, whisk the egg with the milk and add to another, then scoop a few tablespoons of flour in the third dish., Roll each coxinha in the flour, then dip in the beaten egg, and finally roll in the breadcrumbs to coat., Check the oil is hot enough by dropping in a little piece of dough. Once it's turned golden and risen to the surface, the oil is ready. Fry the coxhina for 4 to 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp all over – you'll need to do this in batches., Remove with a slotted spoon onto kitchen paper, then serve straight away, with the spiced avocado dip on the side."

Gently mash with a fork to bring it all together., Toast the bread, then divide between 4 plates and generously spread on the avocado and top with the tomatoes., Top each serve with crumbled feta, a handful of rocket and a drizzle of basil oil."

Deseed and finely chop the chilli, then scatter on top with a grating of lime zest, if you like."

pestle and mortar, then rub into the cuts in the beef. Season well with sea salt and black pepper, drizzle over a little oil and brown the brisket well in a large pan over a high heat., Place the bay leaves, whole peppers, plum tomatoes (breaking them up with the back of a spoon as you go), and the stock in a large pot and bring to the boil., Meanwhile, deseed half the chillies, then finely slice them all. Peel and finely slice the onions, then pick and finely chop the coriander., Add the chilli and onion to the pan with the brisket, cook for 5 minutes, then transfer the lot to the large pot, cover, and leave to simmer for 4 to 4½ hours, or until beautifully tender, stirring occasionally and adding splashes of water to loosen, if needed., Gently pull the beef apart using 2 forks. Remove the bay, add a little vinegar to taste, scatter over the coriander and adjust the seasoning to taste., For the guacamole, squeeze the avocado flesh into a bowl, discarding the skin and stones. Pick and roughly tear in the coriander leaves, peel and finely gate in the red onion, and squeeze in the lime juice., Have a taste, then tweak with more salt, pepper or lime juice, if needed. Roughly chop then scrunch in the tomatoes, picking out any large bits of skin., Deseed and finely grate in the chilli flesh and mix well. Serve with the chilli, tortillas and dollops of yoghurt. Delicious served with a fresh green salad on the side, too."

Place in the hot pan – the moisture from rinsing them will briefly steam the veg before they start to scald and char – turn halfway., Halve 2 ripe tomatoes across the middle and add to the pan cut side down. Leave it all for 5 minutes, or until gnarly and on the edge of catching, removing and tossing in the bowl of dressing as and when they’re done., Peel and destone ½ a ripe avocado, smash up in a pestle and mortar until smooth, then muddle in the juice from 1 lime and season to perfection., To make your tortillas, simply mix 80g of wholemeal self-raising flour with 50ml of water and a pinch of salt until you have a smooth, pliable dough., On a lightly floured surface, roll out one half until 3mm thick and about 20cm in diameter, then cook through and char on one side only in a hot frying pan, so the top bubbles up, and repeat when done, I like to rest them over a rolling pin to give a natural curve to hold your filling., Serve each tortilla loaded up with scalded veg.

a pestle and mortar with the cumin, fennel seeds and a good pinch of sea salt to make a paste., Stir in the chilli flakes, paprika and the juice from 1 lime, then loosen with a good drizzle of olive oil., With a sharp knife, score the skin of the herring at 1cm intervals, being careful not to cut into the flesh. Spoon the rub over the fish and gently push into the slits. Place the fillets on a baking tray, skin-side up, and set aside., For the guacamole, halve and destone the avocados and scoop the flesh into a mortar, reserving the skins. Don’t bother washing the pestle and mortar first – the flavours from the rub will only make the guacamole taste better., Squeeze in the lime juice, pick, roughly chop and add the coriander leaves, then smash it all together. Season, then spoon back into the avocado skins and chill until ready to serve., For the salsa, roughly chop the tomatoes, coriander leaves and chilli on a board, mixing them together as you go. Add a tiny pinch of salt and black pepper and a splash of extra virgin olive oil. Keep running your knife through it until all the flavours are mixed together., Heat your griddle pan over a high heat so it’s screaming hot., Mix the yoghurt and juice of 1 lime together. Line up your taco shells, fillings and greens so you’re ready for the fish., When the pan is hot, pop on the fillets for a couple of minutes, or until the skin is beautifully crisp and the flesh cooked through. Serve up with the gem lettuce and some mixed cress, if you like, and let everyone dig in!"

Roll firmly but not too hard., Remove the roll from the mat and cut into 6 or 8 pieces. Repeat with second piece of nori."

Place a griddle pan over a high heat., Mix the cayenne pepper, paprika, white pepper and oregano with a good pinch of sea salt and a little oil, and rub all over the turkey breasts. Put the turkey in the pan, turn the heat to medium and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, turning halfway., Meanwhile, make the salad and dressing. Halve, destone and peel one of the avocados, then blitz in a blender with the yoghurt, lime juice, chilli, most of the coriander and a good drizzle of oil until you have a creamy dressing. Season to taste, add a splash of water to loosen, if needed, then set aside., Slice the corn tortilla into 1cm strips, place onto a baking tray and bake in the oven for a few minutes, until golden and crisp., When your turkey is almost cooked, add the bacon to the pan for the last few minutes to crisp up. Once done, transfer the turkey to a board to rest, then thinly slice., Cut the lettuces into wedges, then crudely toss in a bowl with the turkey and avocado dressing, then scatter over a board. Crumble over the bacon, add the tortilla strips, then use a spoon to scoop out little nuggets of the remaining avocado and add these., Peel and segment the grapefruit, then scatter over the board with the cress (if using), and the remaining coriander leaves. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over."

Stir in the coriander seeds, fry for a couple more minutes, then add the lentils., Stir in 800ml boiling water and bring back to the boil. Season well, reduce the heat, pop on the lid and simmer for 40 minutes, until the lentils are cooked and beginning to break down., Blacken the peppers by either placing them directly on a gas flame, or griddling them in a griddle pan, turning regularly until blackened all over. Pop them in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and let stand., After about 5 minutes the peppers should be ready, so flake away the blistered skin and remove the stalk and seeds. Slice the flesh into thin strips and leave to one side., Place the chipotle chilli in a small bowl and pour in just enough boiling water to cover. After a few minutes, it should have softened; carefully remove from the bowl and finely chop., Place a medium-sized pan over a medium heat and pour in a lug of olive oil. Add the garlic and all the chillies and fry for 1 minute, then add the peppers and paprika. Fry for a few more minutes, then add the tomatoes., Season well and gradually bring everything to a simmer. Leave to bubble away gently for 10 minutes, until you have a thick and rich tomato sauce. Add a splash of red wine vinegar and set aside. Chop the coriander leaves, then stir through., When your lentils are cooked, roughly purée with a stick blender, then pop back over a medium heat with a lug of oil. Fry for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, so you end up with crispy fried lentils., Place a frying pan over a medium heat and add a splash of oil.

Finely chop and add the chives, along with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Squeeze in the lemon juice and add the remaining dressing ingredients. Whisk well, season to taste with salt and pepper, then pop in the fridge until needed., Remove and discard any tatty outer leaves from the lettuce, then trim and roughly chop the rest., Halve, destone and scoop the avocado flesh onto a board. Roughly chop the tomatoes and peeled eggs, then, using a large knife, bring it all into the centre of the board and start chopping and mixing it together., Shred the chicken meat, discarding the bones and skin, then add to the salad. Crumble over the crispy pancetta and continue chopping and mixing together., Transfer the salad to a nice platter, drizzle over the blue cheese dressing and snip over the cress, then serve."

Place into a heatproof colander and rest it over the quinoa pan. Cover and steam for 3 minutes, or until just tender., Once cooked, drain and rinse the quinoa under cold running water, then leave to cool along with the broccoli. Remove the sweet potato from the oven and leave it to cool, too., Meanwhile, toast the nuts in a dry frying pan over a medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a pestle and mortar and crush lightly., Halve the pomegranate and squeeze half the juice into a large bowl. Add 3 times as much extra virgin olive oil, the lime juice and balsamic vinegar. Whisk well and season to taste., Add the cooled broccoli and sprouts to the dressing, then snip in the cress. Roughly chop the coriander (stalks and all), finely slice the chilli and add to the bowl along with the quinoa and sweet potato., Toss well, spread out on a serving platter, then scoop out and dot over the avocado flesh., Bash the reserved pomegranate half with a wooden spoon so the seeds come tumbling out and scatter these over the platter along with the nuts, snip the cress on top, then serve with the feta crumbled over the top."

                       lime, extra virgin olive oil","First, make the marinade. Peel and chop the onions and garlic., Heat a splash of oil in a pan over a high heat, then cook the onion and garlic for 10 minutes, or until softened and starting to colour., Meanwhile, soak the chipotle and ancho chillies in hot water. Pick the coriander leaves and set aside, then finely chop the stalks., Drain and chop the chillies, then add to the pan with the coriander stalks, cumin, paprika and thyme. Cook for 5 more minutes., Stir in the vinegar, tomato purée, brown sugar, orange zest and juice, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and 400ml of boiling water., Bring back to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, or until glossy and thick., Allow the mixture to cool, remove the thyme stalks, then blitz in a food processor until smooth., Place the pork in a snug-fitting roasting tray and pour the marinade over the top, submerging the pork. Marinate for 4 hours or preferably overnight., Preheat the oven to 220°C/450°F/gas 7., Remove the pork from the marinade, brushing off any excess, and transfer the mixture to a saucepan for later. Return the pork to the roasting dish and roast in the oven for 8 minutes, so it forms a lovely gnarly crust., Reduce the oven to 160°C/325°F/gas 2–3 and cook for 5 to 7 more minutes, or until the pork is tender and slightly pink in the middle., Cover the pork with tinfoil and set aside to rest for 10 minutes., Put the pan of marinade on the hob, adding in any juices from the pork. Let the mixture reduce over a medium-low heat for 10 minutes, or until sticky and delicious. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil for a glossy sauce., To make the rainbow salad, soak the corn for 10 minutes, then drain and cook in a pan of unsalted boiling water for 10 minutes. Remove and leave to cool., Finely shred and place the cabbage in a bowl with the vinegar and a pinch of salt, then scrunch it all together., Cut the cooled corn kernels from the husk, thinly slice the radishes, then peel the carrots into ribbons with a speed-peeler. Cut the lettuce into wedges. Add the veg to the cabbage mixture and toss well., Make the avocado salsa by scooping out and mashing the avocado flesh.

Pour in 125ml of oil and about 200ml of warm water. Mix with a butter knife until it comes together as a dough, adding a splash more water, if needed., Tip the dough onto a floured work surface and knead for 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Pop it back into the bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to prove for 1 hour., Pour a lug of oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat. Peel and finely slice the garlic and onion, and add to the pan along with the cumin. Fry for 10 minutes, or until soft and sticky, stirring regularly., Drain the kidney beans and tip into the pan, then turn the heat up to medium. Add the soured cream and a splash of vinegar, season well with salt and black pepper and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the beans have warmed and softened., Roughly mash the beans or blitz in a blender to your desired texture. Return to the pan (if needed) and leave to one side for reheating later., Divide the dough into 12 even pieces and roll them into balls. Flatten each one with your hand, then roll out on a floured surface into a tortilla roughly 2mm thick and 18mm across., Place a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat to get nice and hot, then dry-fry each tortilla for 1 minute on each side, or until just coloured – you want to make sure they stay soft enough to roll. Keep warm under tin foil while you fry the rest and get your toppings ready., Prep and cook your chosen toppings, as needed – slice and fry the chorizo, coarsely grate the Cheddar, crumble the feta, slice the avocados and dress with lime juice, and fry the eggs to your liking., When you're ready to serve, lay out the toppings. Place the pan of beans over a medium heat for a couple of minutes, or until warmed through, then spread a couple of spoonfuls over each tortilla., Slice the chilli (deseed if you like) and finely chop the coriander. Serve the baleadas with lime wedges in the middle of the table to let everyone build their own. Delicious!"

Bring to the boil, then cook over a medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender., Drain and steam dry, then mash the potatoes until really smooth (use a potato ricer if you have one). Season well and mash in the butter., For the guacamole-style dressing, halve and destone the avocados, then scrape the flesh into a medium bowl. Season with sea salt and black pepper and squeeze over the lime juice., Peel and grate in the onion along with the tomato, then mash together to a chunky guacamole. Chop the coriander and add it to the guacamole with plenty of extra virgin olive oil, then leave to one side., Peel and finely chop the onion, then place into a small bowl with the lime zest and juice. Toss together and leave to one side for 5 to 10 minutes., Finely chop the prawns and mix together with the crabmeat and aji amarillo paste, seasoning well. Mix in the onions, leaving behind the excess juice., Line up 3 bowls – one with flour, one with beaten eggs and one with breadcrumbs., Place a scoop of mashed potato in your hand and roll into a ball (roughly 4cm in diameter). Press a hole in the middle with your thumb, about 2cm deep, and spoon in some prawn and crab mixture., Close the hole as gently as you can to conceal the filling, then repeat until you’ve used up all the mash and filling – you should end up with around 15 croquettes., Roll each croquette in the flour, dip it into the egg (letting the excess drip off), then coat in breadcrumbs., Pour the vegetable oil into a large pan and gently heat to 180°C (a cube of bread dropped into the oil will turn brown within 1 minute)., Gently lower the croquettes into the oil with a slotted spoon and fry for around 4 minutes, or until golden and crisp – you’ll need to do this in batches., Drain the cooked croquettes on kitchen paper, then serve hot on a plate smeared with the guacamole."

Ideally in a food processor, or using a box grater and good knife skills, grate the onion and carrot, then finely slice the cabbage. Very finely slice the chilli by hand, then tip everything into a large bowl., Add most of the coriander leaves, then pour over the avocado dressing and toss together well. Taste and season to perfection again, if needed., Whisk all the eggs together in a bowl, with a splash of water to loosen and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat. Once fairly hot, put in a tiny drizzle of oil followed by a quarter of the egg mixture., Swirl it all around the pan, grate over a quarter of the cheese and let it melt, then cook the omelette gently without colouring it, so it’s soft, silky and smooth, for just under 2 minutes, only cooking on one side., Slide it on to a plate, spoon over a quarter of the avocado slaw, then gently fold up the sides and roll over. Serve with a wedge of lime and a few extra coriander leaves., Repeat with the remaining ingredients, serving them up as you go."

oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Remove the chicken from the fridge and leave to come up to room temperature., Pick the thyme leaves and bash in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, then rub all over the chicken with a lug of olive oil. Halve the lemon, peel and bash the garlic bulb, then stuff inside the chicken cavity., Place the bird in a snug-fitting roasting tray and pop in the hot oven for around 1 hour 30 minutes, or until cooked through. To check, insert a knife into the thickest part of the thigh – if the juices run clear and the meat pulls away from the bone, you know it’s done., Meanwhile, place the flour and a pinch of salt in a large bowl, then gradually add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 150ml of cold water, stirring continuously until the mixture comes together to form a rough dough., Transfer to a flour-dusted surface and knead for around 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic, then shape into a long sausage shape, roughly 45cm in length. Slice the dough into 16 equal-sized pieces, roll into balls, then set aside for later., To make the salsa, preheat a griddle pan over a high heat. Prick the chillies all over with a small sharp knife, remove and discard the papery skin from the tomatillos, then place on the griddle. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until blackened all over, turning occasionally., Trim the spring onions and peel the clove of garlic. Pick the mint leaves into a food processor and add the chillies, tomatillos, spring onions, garlic and the remaining salsa ingredients with a couple of generous pinches of salt, then whiz until smooth., Once cooked, allow the chicken to cool slightly, then strip away the flesh, shredding it as you go (wear rubber gloves if it’s too hot)., On a flour-dusted surface, roll the dough balls into circles, roughly the thickness of a playing card. Preheat a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat, then add the tortillas (you’ll need to do this in batches) and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly golden, turning halfway. Wrap the tortillas in tin foil to keep warm as you go., Meanwhile, shred the lettuce, quarter the cherry tomatoes, then halve and destone the avocados. Pick the mint and coriander leaves., To assemble the tacos, pop some shredded chicken onto the middle of a tortilla, top with some lettuce, herbs, a few tomatoes and a sprinkling of mixed seeds. Scoop over the avocado flesh, crumble a little feta on top and finish with a drizzle of salsa. Roll up and tuck in."

Taste to make sure your dressing is balanced – add a little more oil or vinegar if you need to., On serving plates, lay out the avocado.

Meanwhile, cut the ciabatta in half lengthways, then cut into four equal-sized pieces, about 10–12cm/4–5 inches square., Place the sliced avocado in a bowl and squeeze over some lemon juice to stop it from discolouring. Using a speed peeler or potato peeler, slice the cucumber into long, thin strips on top of the avocado. Add the herbs and cress., Lightly toast the seeds in a dry pan on a medium to low heat, and place to one side to cool. Squeeze a tablespoon of juice out of the blood orange into a bowl, and add 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Season it well and give it a mix., Griddle your ciabatta squares in the griddle pan, charring both sides. Once they are nicely toasted, drizzle with a little of the dressing and put to one side. Place a square of ciabatta on each of four plates, then top each with a quarter of the smoked salmon., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the dressing over the salad and very gently mix with your fingertips. If you feel it needs more dressing, add a little extra, but try not to go overboard – you want it to be very light. Top the smoked salmon with the salad. Finish your delicious starter with a sprinkling of toasted seeds, using half a tablespoon per plate, and garnish with a wedge of blood orange."

toasted","If you’re going to use cooked carrots in a salad you’ve got to make it with some attitude! This fantastic Moroccan-style salad combines roast carrots with avocados – and because they have the same texture in your mouth, I thought I’d add the chargrilled flavour and crunch of toasted ciabatta to round things off. With spices, seeds, yoghurt and a delicious citrus dressing, you’ve got a winner., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Parboil your carrots in boiling, salted water for 10 minutes, until they are very nearly cooked, then drain and put them into a roasting tray. You should flavour them while they’re steaming hot, so while the carrots are cooking get a pestle and mortar and smash up the cumin seeds, chillies, salt and pepper. Add the garlic and thyme leaves and smash up again until you have a kind of paste. The idea here is to build up the flavours. Add enough extra virgin olive oil to generously cover the paste, and a good swig of vinegar. This will be like a marinade, a rub and a dressing all in one! Stir together, then pour over the carrots in the tray, coating them well. Add the orange and lemon halves, cut-side down. These will roast along with the carrots, and their juice can be used as the basis of the dressing. Place in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden.  
While the carrots are roasting, halve and peel your avocados, discarding the stones, then cut them into wedges lengthways and place in a big bowl. Remove the carrots from the oven and add them to the avocados. Carefully, using some tongs, squeeze the roasted orange and lemon juice into a bowl and add the same amount of extra virgin olive oil and a little swig of red wine vinegar. Season, and pour this dressing over the carrots and avocados. Mix together, have a taste and correct the seasoning. Call your gang round the table while you toast or griddle your ciabatta slices., Tear the toasted bread into little pieces and add to the dressed carrot and avocado. Mix together, toss in the salad leaves and cress and transfer to a big platter or divide between individual plates. Spoon over a nice dollop of yoghurt, sprinkle over your toasted seeds and drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil."

and chopped, extra virgin olive oil","Get yourself a biscuit tin and place a handful or two of wood shavings into the tin, followed by your rosemary and sage sprigs. Place your wire rack in the tin, so it sits about halfway down, or bend some chicken wire to fit. Carefully pierce the lid of the tin five or six times with a screwdriver., Most salmon fillets come around the same size and thickness, so their cooking times are similar. Sprinkle the salmon fillets with salt and rub with a drizzle of olive oil. Then lay them skin side down on top of the wire (this acts like a grill rack) and put the lid on the tin., Place it on the hob, over a medium heat, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. After a couple of minutes it will start to smoke a bit., While the fish is cooking, mix all the salsa ingredients together – you can go as light or as heavy on the chillies as you like. When the fish is ready, turn the heat off and leave it to sit for 3 minutes before opening the tin. This will allow any residual smoke and heat to penetrate the fish., Lift the salmon fillets out and place on to individual serving plates. Spoon over some chilli salsa and sprinkle with your whole coriander leaves., Drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil and serve with the lime halves and the rest of the salsa in a little bowl. Lovely with some new potatoes and a green salad for lunch."

It’s best to start by chopping the harder, crunchier veggies first, so trim and chop your scallions and slice your cucumber. Slice your basil. Bring it all into the centre of the board, and continue chopping and mixing together., Add the lettuce leaves, and cress or alfalfa to the board. When everything is well chopped, you’ll have a big mound of salad on the board., Make a well in the middle and drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar. Add the mustard and the salt and pepper. Sprinkle with nuts. Mix up so everything gets well coated and serve on the board or in a bowl."
