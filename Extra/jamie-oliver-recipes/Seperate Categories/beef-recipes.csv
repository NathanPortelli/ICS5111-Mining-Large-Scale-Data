Finely chop or coarsely grate all the veg, then stir it into the pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil., Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft and sweet, stirring occasionally., Add the mince, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, then turn the heat up a little and cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly until the meat is browned and the veg is nicely golden., Scrunch in the tomatoes through clean hands, then half-fill each tin with water, swirl it around to pick up all the last bits of tomato and pour into the pan., Mash everything up with your spoon, add a  pinch of black pepper, reduce the heat to low and leave to cook for 2 to 3 hours, or until thickened and reduced., About 15 minutes before you’re ready to serve, cook the spaghetti in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain. Use tongs to divide between bowls, then spoon over the Bolognese and serve with a good grating of cheese."

Somali Beef Stew | Jamie Oliver recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/137896834.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['to', '8']",,"“This stew is a wonderful way to stretch a little meat into a large, satisfying pot of food. The combination of Xawaash Spice Mix and tomato paste is particularly great, a match made in flavor heaven. Serve over plain rice with hot sauce and cilantro for topping, lime wedges for squeezing over, and bananas for eating alongside (this is very typical in Somalia—a bite of stew and rice followed by a bite of banana and so on). You can make the stew up to a week in
advance and refrigerate it in an airtight container (it gets even better the longer it sits) or freeze it in an airtight container for up to 2 months (defrost in the refrigerator for up to a day before serving). Gently rewarm the stew in a heavy pot set over low heat before serving. ”",,,,,,,,,"2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                canola oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red onion                                                                                                                                                                , thinly sliced, 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    garlic cloves                                                                                                                                                                , minced, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                Xawaash Spice Mix                                                                                                                                                                , (page 74 of In Bibi's Kitchen), 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                tomato paste, 2                                                                                                                                                                teaspoons                                                                                                                                                                kosher salt                                                                                                                                                                , plus more as needed, 2                                                                                                                                                                cups                                                                                                                                                                water, 2                                                                                                                                                                pounds                                                                                                                                                                boneless beef chuck or other stew meat                                                                                                                                                                , cut into bite-sized pieces, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    baking potatoes                                                                                                                                                                , cut into bite-sized pieces, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                     large carrots                                                                                                                                                                , cut into thin coins, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red bell pepper                                                                                                                                                                , stemmed, seeded, and cut into thin strips, Cooked rice, hot sauce (such as Somali Cilantro and Green Chile Pepper Sauce, page 80 of In Bibi's Kitchen), cilantro leaves, lime wedges, and fresh bananas",

before you would like to serve the salt beef, make a start on the brine. Place all the brine ingredients in a large pan on a medium heat. Pour in 2 litres of cold water and bring to boil, then reduce to a simmer for 5 minutes until the salt has dissolved. Set aside and allow to cool completely., Meanwhile, remove the sinew and thick layer of fat from the meat, leaving a little behind for bonus flavour. Pierce the meat with a small sharp knife or skewer all over on both sides and place in a non-metallic sealable container. Pour the cooled brine over the brisket, then seal and store in the fridge for 5 to 7 days, turning the brisket over each day., When the brining time is up, remove the brisket from the container and soak in cold water for 10 minutes., Rinse the brisket well, then place in a large saucepan and cover with fresh cold water, until the beef is submerged., Peel and quarter the onions, then add to the pan with the bay and peppercorns., Bring to the boil, then reduce to a low heat and simmer for 2½ hours to 3 hours, or until the brisket is tender., Meanwhile, mix all the mustard ingredients together in a small bowl and season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Loosen with a drop more vinegar, if it looks a little thick., Slice up the gherkins and place them in a small bowl. Dress them with a couple of tablespoons of their pickling liquor and pick over the dill fronds.  Finely slice the chillies – deseed if you prefer – then add to the bowl and mix together., Carefully remove the brisket to a board and thinly slice off what you need. (You can keep the rest of the meat in the liquor to stop it drying out.), To serve, split your bagels and spread a dollop of mustard on the base. Load up the pickles and pile on slices of the tender salt beef. Top with the bagel lid and tuck in!"

tablespoon of olive oil. Rub all over the steaks and leave to marinate for 30 minutes., Deseed and finely dice the peppers, then dress with extra virgin olive oil and put aside. Quarter the mushrooms, then pick and finely chop the parsley leaves., Get all the other ingredients measured out and ready to go, as you want everything to happen within 6 minutes once the steaks hit the pan – read to the end of the next paragraph before you start cooking so you know what’s coming., Place a large frying pan on a high heat to get screaming hot. Brush the herbs off the steaks, then place the steaks in the pan with a drizzle of olive oil and the butter., Cook for 6 minutes in total, turning regularly and keeping them moving in the pan, making sure to sear the edges and baste with the juices, as you go., Within this time, as soon as the butter turns dark golden and the steak has good colour and character, add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt and pepper, jiggling the pan to keep things moving., Pour in the brandy, then carefully tilt the pan to catch the flame (or light with a long match) and let it flambé – stand back! When the flames subside, add the red wine and reduce by half (if you need to put the flame out, swiftly place a large metal lid over the pan)., Drizzle in the cream, turning the steaks in the sauce until they are nicely coated (briefly remove the steaks from the pan at this stage if your sauce is taking a while to reduce, to avoid overcooking)., Sprinkle over the parsley, then stir through the mustards. Slice the steaks in half, place on a warmed plate and drizzle with the sauce, then scatter over the dressed pepper sprinkle and tuck in. Delicious served with shoestring fries."

heat, then brown the beef all over. Remove to a plate, leaving the pan on the heat., Peel and roughly chop the onions, carrots and celery. Add to the pan with the bay leaves and cook for 5 minutes, or until starting to soften, stirring occasionally. Remove to the plate with the meat., Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and chop into 1cm cubes. Pour the wine into the empty pan and leave it to reduce by half, then add the meat and softened veg back to the pan, along with the potatoes., Pour in the stock, bring to the boil, then reduce to medium-low and simmer for 2 hours 30 minutes, or until the meat is tender, adding splashes of water to loosen, if needed. Once cooked, season to perfection and leave to cool., For the pastry, put the flour and a good pinch of sea salt into a food processor, cube and add the butter, then pulse until just combined. Pick and roughly chop the herb leaves, add to the processor with 100ml of ice-cold water, and pulse again until it forms a rough dough. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes., Preheat the oven to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3 and lightly oil a 20cm loose-bottomed round cake tin., Roll out two-thirds of the pastry on a clean flour-dusted surface to 2mm thick. Loosely roll it around the rolling pin and unroll it over the cake tin, gently easing it into the shape of the tin. Patch up any holes and trim the edges., Spoon in two-thirds of the cooled filling (freeze the rest and serve as a stew another day). Crumble over the Stilton and brush the pastry edges with beaten egg., Roll out the remaining pastry so it’s slightly bigger than the tin and top the pie, crimping the edges to seal. Make a small incision in the centre so steam can escape. Use any spare pastry to decorate the pie, if you like., Eggwash the top, then bake at the bottom of the oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden and the pie is piping hot. Leave to stand for 30 minutes, then serve up. Delicious with creamy mash, extra gravy and steamed seasonal greens."
"Pho sure, it's good | Beef recipes | Jamie Oliver recipes","Rice noodles, skirt steak & fragrant bone broth","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/64503849.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '6']",15 minutes,"“Pho is a celebrated Vietnamese broth made from roasted bones, which is well flavoured and therapeutic to slurp. I’m serving mine with seared skirt steak, brined garlic slices, lots of fresh herbs, sprouts and rice noodles. The soup was first recorded in the early 1900s, when Vietnam was a French colony. Some say that ‘pho’ comes from the French ‘pot-au-feu’, while others think it was Chinese vendors yelling out ‘meat and noodles’, elongating the last word, ‘phan’, which sounded like pho. Ultimately, it’s all about depth of flavour from the broth, embellished with lots of fresh goodies. ”",718,24.5g,9.3g,6.8g,2g,29g,93.9g,1.5g,"300

180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Bash and crack the ginger and place in a very large casserole pan with the beef bones, cinnamon, cloves and star anise., Drizzle with sesame oil and roast for 2 hours, then transfer the pan to the hob over a medium heat and cover the bones with 3.5 litres of water., Bash the lemongrass and add along with the soy and fish sauces, then simmer on a low heat for 2 hours. Skim off any fat from the surface and discard (if you make the broth in advance and let it cool, the fat will solidify on the top and will be super-easy to remove)., To make the brined garlic, simply peel and finely slice the garlic and put into a little dish with the sugar and a good pinch of sea salt. Stir in a couple of splashes of boiling water from the kettle, followed by the vinegar (it’s a nice condiment to spoon over the steak, and adds an extra edge to the broth)., Cook the rice noodles according to packet instructions and divide between 6 bowls., Pick the mint and coriander leaves, then trim the spring onions, peel the onion and finely slice both with the chillies. Cut the limes into wedges. Place it all on a big serving platter with the bean sprouts and take to the table with the noodle bowls., Place a frying pan on a high heat and, once screaming hot, season the skirt steak, pat with groundnut oil, then sear, turning every minute, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until medium-rare (depending on the thickness of your steak). You want it medium-rare, because when you pour the hot broth over the top it will gently cook it through, should you want it to., Remove to a board to rest, then slice up finely and take to the table along with the pan of broth., Get everyone to pimp their own bowls with all the bits and pieces, then pour over some ladlefuls of hot broth. Serve with bottles of hot chilli sauce, fish sauce and soy sauce on the side to perfect the broth to taste."

Cover the porcini with 300ml of boiling water and leave to rehydrate for 5 minutes., Peel and finely chop 2 of the garlic cloves, then place in a large frying pan on a high heat with a knob of the butter. Add the porcini and half the soaking liquor, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes, or until thick and syrupy., Squeeze in the lemon juice, stir in the remaining butter, and season to taste with sea salt and black pepper. Leave to cool slightly., Drizzle the beef with 1 tablespoon of oil and season with black pepper. Sear in a sturdy roasting tray over a medium heat on the hob until browned all over, then remove from the heat., Lay out the slices of prosciutto on a large piece of greaseproof paper, overlapping them slightly, making a sheet big enough to wrap around the fillet., Spread the mushroom mixture lengthways over one half of the prosciutto, then sit the beef on top. Carefully roll up, tuck in the ends, then discard the paper. Secure with butcher’s string., Squash the remaining unpeeled garlic cloves and put into the roasting tray with the herbs, then carefully place the beef on top. Cook in the oven for 25 minutes for rare, 30 to 35 minutes for medium, or 40 minutes for well done., When the time’s up, remove the meat to a board to rest for 5 minutes, pouring any juices back into the tray., Transfer the tray to a medium-high heat on the hob, pour in the wine and the remaining porcini soaking liquor (discarding just the last gritty bit) and simmer to your desired consistency, scraping up all the goodness from the bottom of the tray., Remove from the heat, and sieve before serving, if you like – I also like to whisk in an extra knob of butter for maximum silkiness., Carve up the beef and serve drizzled with the red wine sauce – delicious with celeriac and potato mash, and steamed greens."

Whisk the eggs, flour, milk, 25ml of water and a pinch of sea salt to a smooth batter, then pop into the fridge overnight, removing when you preheat the oven for the meat (or, as a minimum, make the day you need it but leave to rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes)., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., For the gravy, place the bones in a large roasting tray. Trim, wash and roughly chop the leeks, quarter the unpeeled onions, then add to the tray and roast for 45 minutes, or until golden brown., Remove the bones and veg to a large pot, keeping the tray of juices to one side. Top up the pot with 2.5 litres of water, bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for at least 2 hours 30 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half., Place the tray over a medium heat on the hob, then add the flour and stir well to pick up any sticky bits from the bottom. Pour in the wine and port, leave to bubble away for 1 minute, then gradually whisk in a few ladles of the stock, before tipping it all back into the pot., Simmer gently for a further 2 hours, or until you reach your desired consistency., Lift out the bones and strain the gravy, skimming off any fat from the surface, then adjust the seasoning, if needed. Keep aside to reheat at the last minute., When you’re ready, remove the beef from the fridge and leave to come up to room temperature. Turn the oven up to full whack (240ºC/475ºF/gas 9)., Score the beef fat in a criss-cross fashion, then rub with 1 tablespoon of oil., In a blender, blitz the peppercorns, 1 tablespoon of salt and the rosemary leaves to a fine dust, then sprinkle and pat all over the beef., Place a large roasting tray on a medium-high heat, carefully sear the beef on all sides, then transfer to the oven., Immediately reduce the temperature to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and roast for 50 minutes – this will give you medium-rare (cook for a little longer, if you prefer) – then remove to a board. Cover and rest for 30 minutes., Turn the oven up to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7., Divide the dripping between a 6-well deep Yorkshire pudding tray (8.3g per well, if you want to be super-scientific about it!), then place on the middle shelf of the oven for 5 minutes, or until the fat is smoking hot., Quickly but carefully pour the batter into the wells – each should be between half and three-quarters full. Immediately return to the oven and bake for 25 minutes, or until they have quadrupled in volume, are deep golden all over and sound hollow when tapped., Carve and serve up the beef, adding a Yorkshire pudding to each plate, then drizzle with gravy (reheat, if needed). Delicious served with pinches of lemon-dressed watercress, horseradish and crispy roast potatoes."

Transfer to a plate and set aside., Pick the rosemary leaves, peel the onions and garlic, trim the celery and finely chop it all together. Add to the pan with the rosemary. Reduce the heat and soften for 5 minutes., Pour in the wine, bring to the boil and let it bubble until reduced by half. Add the tinned tomatoes and stock, then return the beef to the pan., Secure the lid, bring the cooker to high pressure, then reduce the heat to low–medium and leave to cook for 45 minutes., Meanwhile, make the polenta. In a medium saucepan, bring the milk to the boil with 775ml of water and a good pinch of salt., Very slowly pour in the cornmeal in a thin stream, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Stir for a few minutes until starting to thicken, then turn down the heat to low., Cook for 30 minutes or so, stirring every 5 minutes, until thickened and coming away from the sides of the pan., Stir through the butter, finely grate in the Parmesan and adjust the seasoning., When the time is up on the pressure cooker, carefully release the steam and remove the beef with a slotted spoon., Increase the heat to high and reduce the sauce for 5 to 10 minutes before mixing the beef back into the sauce, breaking up the chunks with the back of a spoon as you go., Spoon the polenta into bowls and serve topped with the stew."

Put in the fridge for a few hours or overnight., About 1½ hours before you’re ready to cook, remove the beef from the fridge and place in a cool corner of the kitchen to come up slowly to room temperature., Preheat your barbecue. Put a few knobs of chilled butter into a bowl of cold water and take those outside with you when you’re ready to cook., This next bit is going to be down to you and your intuition. What works for me every time is taking the fillet out of the bag, quickly patting it with kitchen paper then rolling it in olive oil and putting it on the hottest part of the barbecue to give it colour. Rub it with a chilled knob of butter as you cook it for about 8 to 10 minutes, turning every minute.

Once it looks good, move the fillet to a cooler part of the barbecue to finish cooking to your liking. Another 4 to 5 minutes, turning every minute, should give you medium-done meat. If you like it medium rare, cook it for less, or more for well done. It’s better to err on the side of under-done. That way, the worst-case scenario is that you take the fillet off, slice into it and find that it’s under-cooked, then have to put it back., When you’re happy, put it on a platter, rub it again with butter so it really shines, then drizzle over more Worcestershire sauce, extra virgin olive oil, and thyme and rosemary flowers, if you have them., Let the meat rest for a few minutes, before slicing at the table. Season from a height then quickly rub the slices in the juices before you let everyone grab some."

salt., Use a dough hook to combine, then leave the dough to prove for 20 minutes at room temperature. Return the mixture to the machine and add the butter. Use the dough hook to bring everything together. Weigh out the dough into 50g balls and leave to prove for 1 hour., Peel and finely chop the onions, then pick and roughly chop the thyme. Finely chop the pickled walnuts., Place the onions in a pan with a little oil and sweat down over a low heat for 5 minutes, until soft and sweet but not coloured., Preheat the oven to 100ºC/gas ¼., In a cast iron pan or casserole, fry the beef for 10 minutes over a medium-high heat, until it has lots of colour., Deglaze the pan with the red wine. Add the rest of the filling ingredients (except the walnut juice), bring back to the boil, pop the lid on and slow cook in the oven for 4 hours., Season to taste and add the pickled walnut juice. Your beef mixture should be quite moist at this stage, but if it is too loose, remove the lid and reduce it further over a high heat. Leave to cool, divide into golf-ball sized pieces and roll into balls., Preheat the oven to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3., Flatten each dough ball, add a ball of beef and mould the dough around it. Place on a greased and lined baking tray, crease-side down, and bake for 15 minutes, until they rise slightly and turn golden. Best eaten warm."

Divide the mince into 4 portions and work each ball in your hands for a few minutes to melt the fat and mould them into a relatively smooth, round patty. Make them slightly bigger than your bun, as they will shrink when cooked., Pop them on a tray, cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge., When you're ready to cook your burgers, get your toppings ready. Pick off, wash and spin dry the lettuce leaves, cut your cress, slice the apples, crumble the blue cheese into chunks, and leave everything to one side., Preheat your grill to high. Pop a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a drizzle of oil to the pan., Fry the burgers for around 4 minutes on each side if you like them pink in the middle, or longer if you prefer them fully cooked, seasoning the patties with black pepper as you cook them., Halve and toast the buns under the grill or on a hot griddle, then line them up on a board ready to go., When the burgers are cooked, top each with the blue cheese and pop under the grill for a couple of minutes until nice and oozy., Now build your burgers. First layer the salad leaves and apple onto the buns, followed by a good drizzle of mustard., Pop the burgers on, and top with the cress (a cucumber and chilli relish is great here too). Squish the bun tops on and serve straight away."

If using fresh, peel and roughly chop the tomatoes., Heat the oil over medium heat in a large saucepan and sauté the onions for 5 minutes or until softened. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside., Sauté the beef, reserving the marinade, for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until browned on all sides., Return the onions to the saucepan, add the marinade, tomatoes and tomato purée and enough water to just cover the stew., Season generously with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bring to the boil then simmer for 1½ to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened., Serve with pasta and grated hard cheese, such as kefalotiri, pecorino or Parmesan."

Shake off the excess flour and set the meat aside., Peel and finely dice the shallots. Peel and finely slice the garlic, then peel and grate the ginger., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large shallow frying pan over a medium-low heat and gently cook the shallots and garlic until fragrant but not coloured. Transfer to a large ovenproof dish and set aside., Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons more oil to the same pan on a medium-high heat and brown the oxtail all over, in batches if necessary., Pack the oxtail over the shallots and garlic, then add the cloves, fresh ginger and a good grating of nutmeg. Add the peel from the fresh orange or use dried orange peel, then cover with 2cm to 3cm of water., Place in the oven for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 140ºC/gas 1. Gently simmer for around 2 hours 30 minutes (depending on how big the bones are), or until the meat is just tender. Check the liquid level from time to time, adding more water if necessary., Taste and season, then destone and add the dates and the vinegar. Continue to cook for another 30 minutes, or until the dates are plump and the meat is tender but not yet falling off the bones., Blanch the kale in boiling salted water for 3 to 4 minutes, then drain well., Dice the bacon, then peel and finely slice the garlic. Fry together till cooked, then turn off the heat. Finely chop and stir in the chilli along with the kale., Remove the oxtail from the oven and skim any excess fat from the surface. Serve the oxtail pieces with a few dates, some of the juices and the braised kale."

oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Lightly oil a large roasting tray., Peel and coarsely grate the potato, then place in a bowl with the minced pork and beef. Scrunch together, then use wet hands to divide and roll the mixture into 21 balls, each slightly larger than a golf ball. Reserving 3, place the rest in the prepared roasting tray and set aside., To make the gravy, peel the onions, trim the fennel, then finely chop both and place in a large pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Break in the 3 reserved meatballs, then cook for a further 10 minutes on a high heat, or until dark golden. Stir in the flour for 2 minutes, then add the porter and leave to cook away., Pour in the stock, stir in the remaining gravy ingredients, then bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer for 20 minutes, or until thick and glossy., Meanwhile, season the tray of meatballs with sea salt and black pepper, then cook in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and cooked through., Transfer the tray to a medium heat on the hob, pour over the gravy, add the rosemary sprigs and simmer for a few minutes while you warm the rolls in the cooling oven., Stir a splash of vinegar into the gravy, then grate over the cheese and turn off the heat., Slice open the rolls, then spoon in the cheesy meatballs and gravy. Top with pinches of watercress, and serve with any leftover gravy for dunking. Epic!"

Taste the sauce and season if needed., To finish, pick the rosemary leaves into a bowl. Remove the meatloaf from the oven and pour all the fat from the pan over the rosemary, mixing well., Spoon your sauce around the meatloaf, lay the slices of bacon or pancetta over the top and scatter over the rosemary leaves. Put the pan back in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the bacon turns golden and the sauce is bubbling and delicious., Delicious served with a mixed-leaf salad and lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Sprinkle over the bicarbonate of soda and paprika, and season., Crack in the egg and use your hands to scrunch everything together. Add as much of the sparkling water as you need to make a smooth, pliable mixture., Divide the meat into 10 to 12 pieces and roll each one into a sausage shape, about 10cm long and 2cm thick. Place the cevapi on an oiled baking tray, cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge until needed., For the ajvar, preheat the oven to 230ºC/450ºF/gas 8., Place the whole peppers and aubergines on a large roasting tray along with the unpeeled garlic bulb and roast in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the veg skins are blackened, turning halfway through., Place the charred peppers and aubergines in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave for 20 minutes, to steam off the skins. Once they’ve cooled slightly, pull off and discard the skins, seeds and stalks and chop the flesh on a board., Squeeze out the garlic from 6 of the roasted cloves and add it to the veg along with most of the parsley, then chop it all together (if you have much roasted garlic leftover, stir it into softened butter and store in the fridge – it’s great for garlic bread!)., Keep chopping everything together, season with sea salt and black pepper, squeeze over the juice of 1 of the lemons and drizzle over a good lug of oil. Adjust the seasoning to taste, then set aside., Finely chop the remaining parsley and tip into a bowl. Peel, finely chop and add the onion, squeeze over the juice from the remaining lemon, then mix together. Set aside., Just before you’re ready to serve, warm your flatbreads in the oven, and preheat a griddle pan over a high heat.

Peel and finely chop the garlic, then pick and finely chop the herb leaves., Combine the pine nuts, breadcrumbs, three-quarters of the chopped garlic, raisins, herbs, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and a lug of oil., Divide between the beef, spooning into the centre of one end of each slice. Roll up tightly, sealing in the mixture, then secure with cocktail sticks or kitchen string., Heat a heavy-based ovenproof pan (just big enough to fit all of the rolls snugly) over a medium heat and add a drizzle of oil. Brown the beef rolls on all sides., Peel and finely slice the shallots, then add to the pan with the remaining garlic and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring a little to keep the shallot from catching., Add the wine to the pan and simmer for a few minutes, until evaporated by half. Add the tinned tomatoes, and season., Bring the sauce to the boil, then transfer the pan to the oven and let it bubble away gently for 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the beef is tender when you cut into it, and the sauce is thick and rich. Serve with a green salad."

Cover with clingfilm and, using your fists or a rolling pin, bash them out until they are about 5mm thick, then discard the clingfilm.

Season both sides of the flattened veal with a little black pepper (there’s no need for salt as the prosciutto is quite salty). Lay 2 sage leaves flat on each piece of veal, then place 2 pieces of prosciutto on top to cover the meat, and fold over the sides to neaten up., Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and add 1 tbsp butter and a drizzle of  oil. Add 2 escalopes to the pan and fry for about 2 minutes on each side, until golden brown., When done, remove to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Fry the other 2 escalopes in the same way, then remove to the plate, cover with foil and set aside., Put the pan back on the heat, add the remaining butter and the marsala and simmer for 1 minute until you have a lovely sweet, glossy sauce., Serve the saltimbocca with pasta, polenta or boiled or roast potatoes, and cut the lemon into wedges for squeezing over."

The rezdore of Emilia used to do the sfoglia by hand, but now they use a food processor. ”",531,23g,9.1g,1.1g,,33.3g,47.8g,,"300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                beef brisket, 150                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                beef shank bones, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                free-range chicken thighs and drumsticks, skin on, ½                                                                                                                                                                an                                                                                                                                                                onion, 1                                                                                                                                                                stick of                                                                                                                                                                celery, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    carrot, PASTA DOUGH, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                tipo 00 flour                                                                                                                                                                , plus extra for dusting, 2                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range eggs, FILLING, olive oil, 75                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                lean minced beef, 75                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                higher-welfare prosciutto di Parma, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                higher-welfare mortadella di Bologna, 1                                                                                                                                                                pinch of                                                                                                                                                                ground nutmeg, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Parmesan cheese                                                                                                                                                                , plus extra to serve","First, make a stock. Put the beef brisket, bones, chicken, unpeeled onion and celery in a large stockpot. Halve the carrot lengthways, and add to the pan with a pinch of sea salt., Pour over 2 litres of cold water, or enough to cover. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 4 hours, skimming occasionally., Meanwhile, prepare the pasta dough. Blend the ingredients in a food processor (or combine by hand) until they come together and you have a soft but firm dough. Lightly dust with flour, wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest for 30 minutes., For the filling, heat a little oil in a saucepan, season the mince and fry until cooked through. Drain any water and leave to cool., Transfer to a food processor with the prosciutto, mortadella and nutmeg. Finely grate in the Parmesan, then blitz (or finely chop together by hand) until you have a very fine mixture., You’ll need to make the pasta in stages so it doesn’t dry out. Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Use a pasta machine (or a floured rolling pin) to roll out 1 piece (covering the rest with clingfilm or a tea towel ) into a long, flat, very thin 6cm-wide strip. Slice into 3cm squares., To make the tortellini, lightly dust a tray with flour. Place a ¼ of a teaspoon of filling in the middle of a square of pasta., Fold the pasta over into a triangle, and press at the edges to seal. Wind the folded edge around the tip of your middle finger and press the ends to form a ring., Continue until you have used all the rolled-out dough, then roll the next piece and keep going until it’s all used up. You can make meatballs or ragù with any leftover filling., To serve, strain the stock and discard the meat and vegetables. Taste and adjust the salt, if it’s necessary., Bring to the boil, add the tortellini and cook for about 3 minutes, or till they rise to the surface. Ladle into bowls and serve with extra Parmesan."

Deseed and finely slice the fresh chillies., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large pan over a medium heat, add the onions, garlic, coriander stalks and most of the fresh chilli, then cook for 10 minutes, or until the onion is soft but not coloured., Peel and finely chop the carrots, add to the pan with the paprika, cinnamon and half the cumin seeds, and fry for a further 5 minutes., Reserving the soaking water, drain the rehydrated chillies, then finely chop and stir into the pan. Add the mince, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, then cook for 5 minutes, or until all the liquid has evaporated and the meat has browned., Add the reserved soaking water followed by the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Season with sea salt and black pepper, then bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and leave to tick away for 1 to 2 hours, or until thickened., Meanwhile, char the peppers by carefully holding them with tongs over a flame or placing under the grill, turning regularly until blackened all over. Place in a bowl, cover and leave to steam for 5 to 10 minutes., Discard the blackened skin and seeds from the charred peppers, then slice into strips and add to the chilli., With 5 minutes to go, toast the cumin seeds in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat for 2 minutes. Add a good drizzle of oil, drain and add the beans, then fry until crisp and starting to pop, tossing regularly. Season to taste, then tip into a serving bowl., Season the chilli to taste, remove the cinnamon stick, then scatter over the reserved fresh chilli, coriander leaves and popped beans. Delicious served with a dollop of yoghurt or soured cream."

Peel and finely slice the onions, then pick and finely chop the coriander., Add the chilli and onion to the pan with the brisket, cook for 5 minutes, then transfer the lot to the large pot, cover, and leave to simmer for 4 to 4½ hours, or until beautifully tender, stirring occasionally and adding splashes of water to loosen, if needed., Gently pull the beef apart using 2 forks. Remove the bay, add a little vinegar to taste, scatter over the coriander and adjust the seasoning to taste., For the guacamole, squeeze the avocado flesh into a bowl, discarding the skin and stones. Pick and roughly tear in the coriander leaves, peel and finely gate in the red onion, and squeeze in the lime juice., Have a taste, then tweak with more salt, pepper or lime juice, if needed. Roughly chop then scrunch in the tomatoes, picking out any large bits of skin., Deseed and finely grate in the chilli flesh and mix well. Serve with the chilli, tortillas and dollops of yoghurt. Delicious served with a fresh green salad on the side, too."

Heat the oil in a pressure cooker (or heavy-based casserole). Add the beef and turn it every couple of minutes, or until it's golden on all sides. Remove and set aside., Add the whole shallots and garlic to the pan and cook for around 10 minutes, or until they start to soften and take on colour. Finely grate in around a quarter if the nutmeg, then add all remaining ingredients, except the beef brisket., Half fill the tomato tin with water and tip this in too. Season well with sea salt and black pepper. Gently stir until hot and starting to thicken., Return the beef to the pan and put the lid on, making sure the valve is shut. Cook on a low heat for 1 hour 15 minutes (or 2 hours if not using a pressure cooker)., Release the valve and, once the steam has stopped hissing, remove the lid. Leave the beef to rest for 10 minutes before removing. It should flake apart easily with 2 forks, though if it doesn't, it's fine to continue cooking it for a few more minutes., Stir the remaining sauce and season to taste. Break apart or carve the beef and serve with the lovely rich sauce spooned over the top."

Finely chop the tomatoes. Pick and finely chop the marjoram., Add a good splash of oil to a large pan and gently sauté the onions, garlic and pepper until softened., Add the beef and continue to cook until the meat is browned and the vegetables are cooked., Stir in the paprika and cook for 2 more minutes, then add 200ml of the beef stock. Bring to the boil and cook until reduced by half., Add the marjoram, caraway seeds, a splash of vinegar, the tomatoes, the tomato purée and season well., Add enough stock to cover and simmer until the meat and vegetables are tender, about 1½ to 2 hours., Peel, dice and add the potatoes, plus any remaining stock and a little water if it’s looking too dry, and simmer until the potatoes are cooked., Serve with a dollop of sour cream, if you like."

combine the flour, baking powder and 1 teaspoon of sea salt in a large bowl. Finely chop or coarsely grate the butter, then rub into the dry mix until it resembles fine breadcrumbs., Mix in just enough cold water to bring it together, then wrap in clingfilm and pop in the fridge for 1 hour., Meanwhile, finely chop and add the sirloin with 1 tablespoon of oil to a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes, then remove to a plate., Peel and finely chop the garlic and onion. Deseed and finely chop the pepper and chilli, then add to the frying pan over a medium-low heat. Stir in the paprika and cumin, and fry for 10 minutes, or until softened., Crush the olives with the flat side of your knife, pull out and discard the stones, then finely chop the flesh., Add the purée to the pan and crumble in the stock cube. Fry for a further minute, then add the olives and 100ml of boiling water. Bring to the boil, season lightly with sea salt and black pepper., Cook for 8 to 10 minutes over a medium heat, or until the liquid has almost completely evaporated. Return the beef and any resting juices to the pan, stir well, then leave to cool completely., Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5., Divide the pastry into 14 equal pieces, then roll each portion into 14cm circles and the thickness of a pound coin – use a biscuit cutter or saucer for an accurate round., Spoon 2 tablespoons of the filling onto the middle of each pastry round, brush the edges with a little beaten egg, then fold them over the filling to make a semi-circle. Press the edges together with a fork to seal, then place onto a large, lightly greased baking tray., Brush the empanadas with the beaten egg and bake in the hot oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Leave to rest for a few minutes, then serve on a platter."

piece into a ball, then press into flat patties roughly 2cm wider than your buns. Place on an oiled plate and place in the fridge to firm up., Preheat the barbecue to high or place a griddle pan over a high heat until screaming hot., To make the slaw, add the yoghurt and both mustards to a large bowl and squeeze in the lemon juice. Pour in the extra virgin olive oil and season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then mix together well., Remove the tatty outer leaves from the cabbages and peel the onion and carrot. Coarsely grate all the veg into the bowl of dressing, along with the apple., Pick the mint leaves and finely slice them with the chilli (deseed if you like), gherkins and spinach, then add to the bowl and set aside to toss together just before serving., Season the burgers with a small pinch of salt and pepper and the cumin seeds, then place onto the barbecue or griddle pan., Cook the burgers for 3 to 4 minutes, then flip them over. Place a slice of cheese on top of each one and cook for a further 3 to 4 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the burgers are cooked to your liking., Meanwhile, cook the bacon until sizzling and golden brown all over, then remove to kitchen paper to drain., Once cool enough to handle, chop the bacon  into small pieces, add to the slaw, then mix everything together. Have a taste and add a little more lemon juice or seasoning, if needed., Cut the burger buns in half and lightly toast them, cut-side down., Spread a little tomato ketchup onto each base and place a burger on top. Add a dollop of slaw and the bun tops, then – this is the most important bit – press down to squash all those delicious flavours together, and tuck in!"

lentils","Preheat the oven to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3., Pick and finely chop the thyme and rosemary leaves. Trim, wash and roughly chop the leeks, trim and finely chop the celery, then peel and finely chop the carrots., Place a large stew pot on a medium-high heat with the oil and the herbs. Fry for a couple of minutes, then add the chopped veg and cook for a further 8 to 10 minutes, or until softened a little, stirring regularly., Add the meat and continue to fry until browned all over and the juices have bubbled away. Stir the flour into the pan, then add the tomato purée, horseradish, stock and bay., Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to low. Crumple up and wet a piece of greaseproof paper, then open it out and place on top of the stew. Cover with a lid and pop in the oven for 2 hours., At this stage, remove the greaseproof and skim away any fat from the surface, then top up with 200ml of water. Sprinkle in the lentils, then replace the greaseproof, cover and pop back in the oven for a further 30 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through., When the time’s up, remove the bay leaf and give the stew a good stir to make sure that nothing has stuck to the bottom of the pan. If the stew is a bit thick, add a little boiling water to thin it down. If it’s a bit thin, sit the pot on the hob and simmer gently until the liquid reduces to your desired consistency., Taste the stew and season with freshly ground black pepper, if necessary. Delicious served with mashed or baked potato and some lemony dressed greens."

                            , for grating","Strip and finely chop the rosemary leaves and finely chop the bacon., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large casserole pan on a high heat. Once hot, add the rosemary and bacon and fry for 2 minutes, or until the bacon starts to crisp up, stirring regularly., Add all the minced meat, using a wooden spoon to break it up as you go. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for at least 10 minutes, or until all the liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally., Place the coarse grater attachment in your food processor (or you could use a box grater instead) and grate the Cheddar, then tip into a bowl., Replace the grater with the regular blade. Trim and halve the carrots, then add to the processor and blitz to roughly the same size as the mince. Peel and halve the onions, add them to the carrot and blitz again., Tip into the pan with the mince while you get on with blitzing and adding the celery. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the vegetables start to soften, stirring regularly., Next, add the tomato purée and plum tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon. Fill each of the tins with water and tip into the pan.
Give everything a good stir and reduce the heat to low. Leave to simmer around 2 hours, or until thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally., While that ticks away, make your white sauce. Trim, wash and finely slice the leeks, then add to a pan along with 2 tablespoons of oil and the bay leaves. Stir well and season with a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Reduce the heat to low and cook for 30 minutes, or until sweet and softened, adding splashes of water, if needed., Add the flour and stir well to coat, then gradually add the milk, stirring continuously. Turn the heat up to medium, bring to the boil, then reduce to low and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened, stirring regularly., Carefully transfer the sauce to the food processor and blitz until smooth and silky. Add half the grated cheese and finely grate over half the nutmeg and mix well. Season to taste., Once the ragù is ready, preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Season the ragù to taste, then transfer half into freezer bags, portioning up as appropriate for your family. Allow to cool to room temperature, then pop in the freezer for another day. It’s a good idea to freeze them flat so that you can reheat them quickly and easily. It’s also a good idea to label and date them to avoid a game of freezer roulette in a few weeks' time!, To build your lasagne, spoon a quarter of the ragù into a large deep ovenproof dish (roughly 25cm by 30cm) and spread it out evenly., Spoon over a quarter of the white sauce, then snap over some lasagne sheets, making sure they completely cover the sauce in one layer. Repeat this 3 times, finishing with a layer of white sauce., Sprinkle over the remaining cheese and bake the lasagne in the oven for 45 minutes or until golden and bubbling., Remove the lasagne from the oven and leave to sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Delicious served with a fresh green salad."

                    spring onion, You will need, 32 wooden skewers","Eaten straight off the grill, these sizzling beef skewers are a popular and delicious Nigerian street food snack., Around 1 hour before you start, soak 32 wooden skewers in plenty of cold water., Very finely slice the beef, flatten slightly with the flat side of your knife, then place on a plate. Cover and place in the fridge until needed., To make the marinade, bash the uda pods in a pestle and mortar. Remove and discard the seeds, then place the pods into a liquidiser with the peanuts and spices. Crumble in the stock cube, then blitz for 5 to 10 minutes to a rough powder, stopping and stirring the mixture from time to time. Transfer the ground spices to a large bowl., Peel and roughly chop the onion, garlic and ginger. Trim and deseed the chillies and pepper, then roughly chop. Trim and roughly chop the spring onion. Add it all to the liquidiser and blitz until smooth. Transfer the mixture to the ground spices and stir well. Turn the beef in the marinade until well coated, then thread 4 to 5 slices onto each soaked skewer. Place on a tray, cover and pop in the fridge to marinate for around 3 hours., To make the salad, finely slice the tomatoes, then trim and finely shred the cabbage. Peel and finely slice the onion, then finely slice the cucumber. Place into a large bowl with a squeeze of lemon juice, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper., Preheat a large griddle pan over a medium-high heat. Drizzle the skewers with a little olive oil, then place on the griddle for 1 to 2 minutes, or until beautifully gnarly and golden, turning regularly (you’ll need to do this in batches). Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil, then serve with the salad and extra lemon wedges for squeezing over., Jamie's Tip: Uda pods add a lovely sharp, peppery taste to dishes and are used a lot in West African cooking. If you can’t get hold of them, Szechuan peppercorns are similar in flavour."

100ºC/212ºF/gas ¼., Place the ribs in a snug-fitting roasting tray, season with sea salt and black pepper, drizzle with oil, then rub all over. Cover tightly with a double layer of tin foil, then cook for 7 to 8 hours, or until tender., When the time’s up, transfer the ribs to a baking tray. Skim away the fat from the roasting tray and reserve in an airtight jar (use it for delicious roast potatoes another day)., Place the roasting tray over a high heat on the hob and bring the juices to the boil. Simmer for around 2 minutes, then add the remaining sauce ingredients. Bring back to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for a further 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and coats the back of a spoon., Brush most of the sauce onto the ribs so they’re nicely coated all over, then return the ribs to the oven for 20 to 40 minutes, or until sticky and caramelised to your liking., Meanwhile, place a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add the caraway seeds and toast for around 1 minute, or until smelling fantastic. Tip into a large bowl., Finely chop the dill and pickled onions, then add to the bowl with the mayo, yoghurt, mustard, white wine vinegar and a splash of the pickled onion vinegar. Whisk well to combine., Remove the beetroot leaves and set aside. Scrub and trim the beetroot and carrots, then pass all the vegetables and the beetroot leaves through the fine slicing attachment in a food processor. Add to the dressing, toss and scrunch everything together, then season to taste., Transfer the ribs to a chopping board, then carve up and serve with the winter slaw, remaining BBQ sauce and creamy mashed potato, if you like."

seeds, paprika and 1 teaspoon each of sea salt and black pepper in a pestle and mortar., Carefully cut the squash in half lengthways, deseed, then chop into 4cm chunks. Toss with half the spice mixture and a drizzle of olive oil on a baking tray., Roast for 50 minutes, or until golden, then remove from the oven and reduce the temperature to 150°C/300°F/gas 2., Meanwhile, drizzle both cuts of meat with olive oil and rub with the remaining spice mixture, then place a large casserole pan (at least 30cm wide, 8cm deep) on a medium-high heat., Put the pork and brisket into the pan fat side down and brown on all sides for around 15 minutes in total. Remove both meats to a plate and reduce the heat under the pan to medium., Peel and roughly chop the onions and add to the fat in the pan. Fry for 10 minutes, or until lightly caramelized, stirring regularly., Add the balsamic and the porcini liquor (discarding just the last gritty bit). Roughly chop and add the porcini, followed by the beans (juice and all), then scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands., Return both meats to the pan, loosen with a splash of water if needed, then bring to the boil. Season, and sit a layer of wet greaseproof paper directly on the surface. Cover with tin foil and cook in the oven for 5 hours, or until the meat is tender., Prick the peppers and chillies, then blacken all over in a griddle pan or directly over the flame of a gas hob. Place in a bowl, cover and leave to cool, then peel and deseed them, keeping as much juice as you can for extra flavour. Roughly chop with half the coriander, and toss with a little salt and pepper., When the meat is tender, remove from the oven, break up the meat, then stir in the squash, peppers and chillies. Adjust the consistency with water, if needed, taste and season to perfection, and keep warm., To finish, make the salsa. Peel the onion, then finely chop with the apples and the remaining coriander. Dress with the cider vinegar and extra virgin olive oil and season to perfection., Serve the chilli with the salsa. Also good with bread or rice, and yoghurt."

Place a large non-stick heavy-bottomed pan on a high heat. Once screaming hot, drizzle the steak with olive oil, then put it into the pan and cook for 3 minutes on each side for medium, or to your liking., Remove to a plate, rest for 1 minute, then slice 1cm thick and toss through its own resting juices with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil., Cut the warm ciabatta in half and rub the inside of each piece in the steak resting juices. Spread on some mustard, if you like, then layer over the caramelised onions, the steak and pinches of watercress., Pop the other piece of bread on top, press down lightly, carve up into decent chunks and get involved.￼￼￼"

                 fresh basil","Put all the minced meat into your largest pan on a high heat with a good lug of oil and a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Cook for 20 minutes, or until golden, stirring regularly., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the garlic, onions, carrots and celery. When the mince has got a good colour, add all the chopped veg and cook for a further 10 minutes, then add the Chianti and cook it away., Pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, and add half a tin’s worth of water. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 1 hour, or until the meat is tender and the sauce is super-thick. Remove from the heat to cool, then finely grate and stir in the Parmesan., Now it’s time to assemble your pasta. Following the instructions for making the pasta dough, roll out your dough to 1mm thick, then make your ravioli about 7cm square. I work with a quarter of the pasta at a time to give more control., Use a heaped teaspoon of filling in the centre of each one, sealing the edges with a light brushing of water and pushing out the air – you should get about 50 to 60 ravioli from this amount of pasta. Place them on a semolina-dusted tray as you go., Freeze the remaining Bolognese (you’ll have roughly half left) for a rainy day, or make a double batch of pasta and freeze as ravioli – you can cook them from frozen in the sauce., Put a pan of salted water on to boil for the pasta., For the sauce, peel and roughly chop the garlic and deseed and finely chop the chillies. Place a pan on a medium heat, add a lug of oil and the garlic and chilli, and fry for a few minutes, or until very lightly golden. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, or until thickened and reduced, then remove from the heat and blitz until smooth with a stick blender. Taste and season to perfection, then place back on a very low heat., Cook the ravioli in the boiling salted water for 3 minutes, or until tender, then use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the sauce. Gently toss together and simmer for another couple of minutes, then divide between warm bowls, scatter with baby basil leaves and serve with a few extra gratings of Parmesan, if you like."

deseeded","Set up your barbecue for the heat canyon technique (place the coals on opposite sides of the barbecue to make two heat walls – this will create sections of hot, direct heat on the sides, with an indirect, cooler area in the middle to ensure your meat gets consistent heat throughout the cook). Place a drip tray inside the middle of the barbecue. Cover with the lid and allow to heat up like an outdoor oven – you want a temperature of around 160°C/320°F., To make your sauce, combine the BBQ sauce and ketchup with a few drops each of Tabasco and chilli sauce, then set aside. Finely dice the onion, pepper and carrot, then put into a large bowl with all the mince, the garlic, bay, Worcestershire sauce, breadcrumbs, salt and pepper. Beat the eggs and add to the mixture, then use your hands to scrunch and mix it all together. Grate in half the cheese (if using), and scrunch to combine., Remove the mixture to a clean work surface and shape into a rectangular loaf (roughly 25cm in length). Using the handle of a wooden spoon, make four diagonal indents (roughly 1cm deep) into the top of the loaf at 3cm intervals, then pour over half the sauce. Place the meatloaf on a big piece of tin foil or in an old roasting tray, then place on the middle of the barbecue. Cover with the lid and cook for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, or until cooked through. Grate and sprinkle over the remaining cheese (if using), and continue cooking for a minute or so with the lid on, until melted. Remove to a board to rest for around 10 minutes, then slice it up and serve drizzled with the remaining sauce. Cheers, Grandma!"

medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil. Roughly chop and add the bacon, then pick in the thyme leaves and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden., Turn the heat up slightly, then stir in the beef mince, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Cook for around 5 minutes, or until browned all over. Add the wine and crumble in the stock cube, stirring continuously until the liquid has completely reduced. Stir in the tomatoes and 1 tin’s worth of water and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook for around 1 hour, then remove the lid and continue cooking for 30 minutes, or until thickened and reduced., Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Make the béchamel sauce: place the milk, butter and flours in a medium pan over a low heat. Heat gently, whisking continuously for 12 to 15 minutes, or until thickened. Grate in three-quarters of the Parmesan and a good grating of nutmeg. Season to taste, then set aside., Cut the sheets of pasta into rectangles (roughly 10cm x 15cm)., Spoon one-third of the Bolognese sauce into an ovenproof dish (roughly 25cm x 30cm). Layer over one-third of the lasagne sheets and top with one-third of the béchamel sauce. Repeat with the remaining ingredients until you have three layers in total, finishing with a final layer of béchamel. Grate over the remaining Parmesan and drizzle with olive oil, then cover with tin foil. Place in the hot oven for around 20 minutes, remove the foil and continue cooking for around 30 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. Serve with a nice, crisp salad."

Cut away and discard the ciabatta crusts, tear into chunks and place in a bowl. Cover with cold water and leave to soak. Meanwhile, finely slice the mortadella, 2 garlic cloves and the parsley leaves, then place into a large bowl with the mince, eggs and grated Parmesan. Squeeze the water out of the bread and add to the bowl., With wet hands, scrunch and mix everything together, season well with salt and pepper, then divide and roll into 12 equal-sized balls. Place in a roasting tray (about 25cm x 30cm), drizzle over a little olive oil and place in the fridge for about 10 minutes to firm up., Meanwhile, finely chop the remaining garlic cloves, the onion and chilli. Drain and finely chop the peppers, reserving the brine. Place the meatballs into the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden, shaking the tray from time to time to stop them from sticking, then place directly over a low heat on the hob. Add the wine, allow it to boil and bubble away, then stir in the onion, garlic and chilli and cook for a few minutes, or until turning golden. Stir in the pepper and brine, and the plum tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of a spoon, then season and add a splash of balsamic vinegar., Return the tray to the hot oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through (if the meatballs start to golden too quickly, cover the tray loosely with tin foil). Cut the mozzarella into 12 slices, then carefully place on top of each meatball and return to the oven for a further minute, or until melted., Open out the bread rolls, fill each with a cheesy meatball, spoon over the tomato sauce, then add a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.

Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6 and place a large roasting tray inside to heat up., Peel the potatoes, halving any larger ones, then parboil in a pan of boiling salted water for around 12 minutes. Drain, chuff up and leave to steam dry while you separate and bash the unpeeled garlic cloves., Carefully remove the hot tray from the oven and drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then add the butter, rosemary sprigs and garlic, followed by the potatoes. Gently toss to coat, then season with sea salt and roast for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until beautifully golden and crisp., Meanwhile, put your chosen flavoured vinegar ingredients into a small water spritzer and set aside. Make a herb brush by tying the woody herbs to the end of a wooden spoon with string., Put a large ovenproof frying pan on a high heat to get nice and hot. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, season the steak well and add to the pan, fat side down. Leave for a few minutes so the fat renders out., Now sear for around 8 minutes, or until browned all over, turning and basting with the herb brush every minute or so., Transfer the pan to the oven for 15 minutes for medium, or until cooked to your liking, turning halfway. Move the steak to a board, drizzle with the pan juices and leave to rest., A few minutes before the roast potatoes are ready, spritz them with the flavoured vinegar – not too much, you want it to be subtle. Return them to the oven for 30 seconds, then lightly squash them with a fish slice. Spritz again and return to the oven for a final few minutes., Slice up the steak and sprinkle with a little salt. Mix a splash of extra virgin olive oil into the resting juices, then drizzle over the steak. Serve with the vinegary roasties. I like to have a good pinch of watercress and a dollop of mustard on the side, too."

hearty dinners, chilling out indoors and most importantly, spending time with family. To reflect that vibe, I’ve made this warming, Bloody Mary-spiked beef, which you can leave to tick away for hours while you get on with your day. Served with creamy horseradish mash, this is exactly the fare you’ll want when you return home from a cold stroll outdoors., Preheat the oven to 130ºC/250ºF/gas ½. Place a snug-fitting casserole pan over a medium heat to get hot. Season the brisket all over with salt and pepper, then add to the hot pan with a splash of olive oil and cook for about 10 minutes, or until gnarly and browned all over. Meanwhile, trim and chop the celery into 5cm chunks, reserving the yellow leaves for later, then peel and quarter the onions. Add the chopped veg to the pan, reduce the heat to low and cook gently for 5 to 10 minutes, or until slightly softened., Combine all of the Bloody Mary ingredients in a large jug, then pour into the pan with 250ml cold water and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Make a bouquet garni by tying the thyme, rosemary and bay together with string, then add to the pan and bring everything to the boil. Take the pan off the heat and cover with a cartouche – this is basically a scrunched-up piece of greaseproof paper that you place directly on the surface of the food. Cover the pan with tin foil and cook in the oven for 5 to 6 hours, or until the beef is tender and falling apart., When there’s about 30 minutes to go, peel and slice the potatoes into 2.5cm chunks. Add to a large pan of cold salted water, place over a high heat and bring to the boil, then cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Meanwhile, if using, remove and wash the outer green leaves of the cabbage, then roll them up like a cigar and finely slice. Add the sliced cabbage or curly kale to a pan of boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender, then drain., Drain the potatoes in a colander and leave to steam dry, then return to the pan and mash well with the butter and horseradish. Season to taste, and add a little more horseradish if it needs it. Divide between plates and spoon over the greens, then pull the beef apart with two forks, pile on top and finely grate over a little fresh horseradish. Scatter over any reserved celery leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve."

Add the oxtail and any roasting juices, cover with the beef stock or 1 litre of cold water and stir well., Turn the heat up to high and bring to the boil, then pop the lid on and place in the hot oven for around 5 hours, or until the meat falls away from the bone, stirring every hour or so and adding a splash of water to loosen, if needed., Remove the pan from the oven and leave to cool for about 10 minutes. Using rubber gloves, strip the meat from the bones and return to the pan, discarding the bones., Add a good splash of Worcestershire sauce, season to taste and enjoy with creamy mash and seasonal steamed greens."

Mountain oysters, which are deep-fried calves’ balls, are a Wild West delicacy. Although fairly tasty, I wasn’t sure it would be the most popular recipe to include in this book, so I made up my own cowboy meatball dish instead. These monster meatballs are so delicious: they’re stuffed with cheese and smothered in a rich chilli sauce. I hereby dedicate these balls to all the bulls in the Wild West losing theirs!, Preheat your oven to full whack. Put a large pan on a medium heat and add a good lug of olive oil. Add the 2 diced onions and fry for 10 minutes or until softened, then remove from the heat and leave to cool completely. Put your minced meat into a bowl with the mustard, oregano, cumin, coriander, breadcrumbs, eggs, a good pinch of salt and pepper and the cooled onions. Use clean hands to really scrunch it all together well, then divide the mixture into 8 rounds., Pick each round up, one at a time, and roll into a cricket-sized ball. Stick your thumb deep into the ball to make a pocket, then stuff in a good pinch of grated cheese. Cup, pack and pat the meat around the cheese, using your hands to mould it back into a ball. You’ll soon get the hang of it. Place the balls in a large oiled casserole dish or roasting tray, drizzle over a good lug of olive oil, then bang into the oven for 25 to 30 minutes until golden and sizzling., Meanwhile, crack on with your chilli sauce. Use kitchen paper to wipe out the pan you cooked your onions in, and put it back on a medium heat with a few lugs of olive oil. Add the onion, peppers, garlic, fresh chillies and paprika and fry gently for about 15 minutes. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, vinegar, molasses or sugar, mustard, coffee and tomatoes, and bring everything to the boil. Turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. It should be thick and delicious, but if you’d like it a bit thicker just turn the heat up and cook for a few more minutes., Remove the cooked meatballs from the oven when they’re ready and spoon away as much of the fat from the pan as you can. Pour your chilli sauce over the top, and return the pan to the oven for 5 more minutes. Finely chop your parsley, sprinkle over, and serve with a spoonful of rice or mash and a lemony green salad. The cowboys I met could easily nail two of these in one sitting, but if you aren’t going to be roping cattle all day I’d say one is probably plenty!"

If you’re doing it yourself, carefully trim the meat by discarding any fat or silver skin. Cut the meat against, rather than with, the grain into 2.5cm thick pieces., Make the coffee and, while it’s hot, soak the dried chillies in it for a few minutes to let them rehydrate., Meanwhile, peel and dice the onions and peel and finely slice the garlic., Heat a few lugs of oil in your largest casserole pan on a low heat, add the cumin, paprika, oregano, bay and onions. Fry for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened., Deseed and chop half the fresh chillies. Slice up the rehydrated chillies and add them to the onion mixture along with the chopped fresh chilli, the cinnamon sticks, sliced garlic, a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper and a splash of the chilli-infused coffee., Stir, then add the rest of the coffee, the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of a spoon, and the molasses or sugar. Add the pieces of brisket and another good pinch of salt and pepper, cover with a lid and simmer for around 3 hours, stirring occasionally., After a few hours use 2 forks or a potato masher to break the meat up and pull it apart., Once you’ve done this, deseed, slice and add the peppers, then drain and add the beans. Leave to simmer with the lid off for 30 minutes, or until the meat is completely falling apart and delicious, stirring occasionally., Have a taste and season well – if you require a bit more heat (like I would), this is the time to deseed and chop the rest of the fresh chilli and stir it in., Dollop a big spoonful of soured cream over the chilli (if using), and serve straight from the pan, with fluffy rice, flatbreads or potatoes and a really nice fresh lemony green salad.

Place a large sturdy roasting tray in the oven to heat up., Strip most of the rosemary leaves into a pestle and mortar, and peel and add 3 cloves of garlic, then bash to a paste with a pinch of sea salt and a lug of oil., Tip the paste onto the beef and massage all over, getting into all the nooks and crannies., Quickly squash the remaining unpeeled garlic cloves and scatter into the hot roasting tray with the beef. Place straight into the oven and roast for around 50 minutes, basting occasionally with the juices from the tray., When the time’s up, reduce the temperature to 190°C/375°F/gas 5 for around 10 minutes, or until the beef is beautifully golden brown on the outside and pink in the middle – leave in for longer if you prefer your beef well done., Carefully transfer the beef to a platter, dot the knob of butter on top, then use the remaining rosemary to brush all over the meat. Cover with a double layer of tin foil and a tea towel, then leave to rest., Serve the beef with the resting juices drizzled over the top – delicious served with perfectly golden roast potatoes, Amazing Yorkies, dressed watercress and a good dollop of horseradish."

Put the shavings into iced or very cold water for about a minute – this gives you a lovely crispy texture but the downside is that you lose flavour, so be quick. As soon as the fennel starts to curl up, drain it in a colander, remove any ice cubes, spin it
really dry in a salad spinner and put to one side., Whip up the eggs with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Add a splash of water to the mixture as this will give you thin crêpe-like omelettes., Rub a little olive oil over the bottom of a 20cm non-stick frying pan and place it on the heat. Working quickly, pour in a little egg mixture and tilt the pan so it runs all round the bottom. In less than a minute your crêpe will be opaque and cooked through., Touch it lightly to test whether it’s done. If it is, hold the pan at an angle and start to peel it away with a spatula. Be gentle and don’t rush – if you mess the first one up, don’t worry, you’ll get the feel for it! When you’ve made your crêpes, stack them on a board and cover them with tin foil to keep them warm., Put the fennel and all the salad leaves into a bowl. Divide the bresaola between four plates and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil., Remove the tinfoil from the crêpes. Roll them up one at a time and slice them 1 to 2cm wide. Toss them gently with your fingers to unwind them. Add them to the bowl of fennel and salad leaves with the grated Parmesan., Dress with 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper and toss gently but thoroughly. Taste and balance with seasoning and a little extra lemon juice if need be., For a cool tweak, add a teaspoon of truffle oil. Sprinkle the reserved herby fennel tops over the salad. Place the salad bowl in the middle of the table with your plates of bresaola and let everyone help themselves. Lovely finished with an extra grating of Parmesan."

or chicken stock","Cook the potatoes and mixed veg in a pan of boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes. When they’re cooked right through, drain and put to one side., Heat a glug of olive oil and half the butter in a large frying pan and add the chestnuts. When they start to sizzle, add your potatoes and veg. Mash the veg up in the pan, then pat the mixture into a thick pancake shape., Fry on a medium heat for about half an hour, checking it every 5 minutes. When the bottom turns golden, flip it over bit by bit and mash it back into itself. Pat it out flat again and continue cooking until really crisp all over., Preheat the oven and a roasting tray to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7., Unravel the pork sausage links and squeeze the filling between them until all 6 sausages are joined together. Do the same to your venison or beef sausages. Pat them to flatten them a bit., Drizzle with olive oil and massage this into your 2 long sausages. Sprinkle over a pinch of pepper, the rosemary and some nutmeg., Put one sausage on top of the other and roll them up like a liquorice wheel! Poke two skewers through, in a cross shape, to hold the sausages together., Take the preheated tray from the oven. Drizzle in some olive oil and add the onions. Season, add the remaining butter and stir. Place the sausage wheel on the onions and stick the bay leaves between the sausages. Drizzle with some more oil and roast in the preheated oven for around 40 minutes, or until
golden and crisp., When your sausages and onions are done, your bubble  and squeak should be ready too. If it still hasn't browned, put it under a hot grill for 5 minutes., Remove the sausages to a plate and place the tray with the onions on the hob. Whack the heat up to full and stir in the flour, balsamic vinegar and stock. Bring to the boil and leave to thicken to a nice gravy consistency, stirring every now and then, and season to taste., Remove the skewers from the sausages and cut the sausages into wedges. Serve the bubble and squeak with a good portion of sausage, a spoonful of onion gravy and perhaps some lovely dressed watercress."

They serve their haggis on large spoons instead of in the sheep’s stomach (which is the traditional way). So I've decided to write a recipe that anyone, anywhere in the world, can make as long as they have access to a fairly decent butcher. I think it still preserves the beautiful soul and attitude of haggis, and my mate Peter Begg, who is 110% Scottish, says it’s the nicest haggis he’s ever had. That made my year, so what are you waiting for?

processor with the bacon and thyme leaves and pulse until finely chopped. Put a very large casserole-type pan (roughly 25cm in diameter) on a medium heat, add a good lug of olive oil, then add the allspice, pepper, ground cloves, a good pinch of salt, and grate in the nutmeg. Stir for a few minutes, until it’s smelling fantastic, then tip in everything from the food processor and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until the veg are starting to soften., Cut the steak into roughly 2cm pieces and pulse in a food processor until it looks like mince. Add to the pan of veg, then do the same with the lamb or mutton and the heart. Get rid of any sinewy bits. Halve the kidneys, and quickly rinse them and the livers in a bowl of water. Drain, then pulse in the processor once or twice – don’t purée them! Add to the pan, then cook and stir everything for about 15 minutes, or until the meat starts to colour. At this point, add the bay leaves and 500ml of stock or water, then cover with a lid and leave to blip away on a low heat for around 2 hours, stirring now and then to make sure it doesn’t catch and adding a splash of water if needed., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. After 2 hours, spoon a few ladles of the haggis mixture (avoiding the bay leaves) into the clean food processor and blitz to a fairly smooth consistency. Stir this back in to add a lovely creaminess. Spread the pinhead oats on a baking tray and toast in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until golden. Stir into the haggis mixture, then add the remaining stock. Simmer with the lid off for about another 30 to 35 minutes. This is a great time to cook your neeps and tatties., Once the time is up, fish out the bay leaves and continue cooking until you’ve got a nice thick consistency. Turn the heat off, then correct the seasoning to push it to the point of perfection. Stir in the whisky, a few gratings of lemon and orange zest and the Worcestershire sauce. Taste and correct the flavours if needed, then put the lid on and leave until you’re ready to serve – preferably with plenty of good friends and a dram or two of fine Scottish whisky., PS: Put the leftover haggis into an earthenware-type dish and top it off with neeps and tatties. It makes the most exciting sorta-shepherd’s pie."

Peel, finely slice and add the onions, then pick, finely chop and add the rosemary and thyme, along with the bay leaves. Cook for 20 minutes, or until the onions are soft and turning golden, stirring occasionally., Slice the beef into rough 2cm strips, then clean and slice the mushrooms. Add both to the pan along with the tomato purée and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Stir in the balsamic, stout, flour and stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour 20 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the meat is tender., Meanwhile, for the pastry, put the flour and a good pinch of salt into a bowl with the suet, cube and add the butter, then use your thumb and forefingers to rub the fat into the flour until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs., Slowly stir in 125ml of ice-cold water, then use your hands to gently bring it together into a ball, but don’t overwork it. Wrap in clingfilm and place in the fridge for later., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Ladle the stew into pie dishes – you can make a collection of small pies, or one or two larger ones – then finely grate or crumble over the cheese., Roll out the pastry on a clean flour-dusted surface, so it’s slightly bigger than your pie dishes. Eggwash the edges of the dishes, then carefully place the pastry on top, trimming off any overhang. Pinch the edges to seal., Decorate the tops with any offcuts, if you like, then brush with a little more egg. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the pastry is beautifully golden.

Drizzle lightly with extra virgin olive oil, then put aside., Place a griddle pan over a high heat. Thickly slice the mushrooms (if using), then grill until golden and nutty, then remove and keep warm until needed., Season the steak well with salt, pepper, oregano and paprika, then bash with the bottom of a heavy pan to flatten slightly., Rub the steak with a little olive oil, then cook on the hot griddle for 5 minutes, or until cooked to your liking, turning every minute. Remove to a plate to rest., Lay the tortillas out flat on a clean work surface, then spread over a little guacamole., Slice the steaks into thin strips, then divide between the tortillas with the mushrooms (if using). Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and the resting juices., Top with a dollop of yoghurt, the remaining coriander leaves and some finely sliced red chillies (if using), then wrap up. Serve with the lime wedges on the side for squeezing over."

Just get a whole tray of forks together and lay out your ingredients. The ideas I’m giving you are simply for things I think go really well together, but if there are certain combos you love, get those going too., The beauty of these wonderful forkfuls is that they can be rattled out in no time flat. So you can make them as you’re chatting to your guests, or rope your partner or mate into rattling 10 or 20 out. It’s about putting things you like the taste of together, on a fork or in a spoon… Simple!, Bresaola is an Italian cured beef that goes brilliantly with the flavours on this fork. Simply smear a little English mustard cover a slice of bresaola then add a pinch of coleslaw in the middle. Pop a few cornichons on top then stab on your fork and finish with a tiny drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a good squeeze of lemon juice."

Finely slice the bacon., Heat the oil in a very large casserole pan over a medium-low heat, add the bacon, followed by the onion, garlic, carrot, celery and squash and cook gently for about 15 minutes, or until soft., Add the mince, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook for about 10 minutes., Turn the heat up, pour in the wine and leave to bubble and cook away for a few minutes, then tip in the tomatoes and 2 tins' worth of water. Drop in the rosemary sprigs and bay leaf, and season with sea salt and black pepper., Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 1½ hours. After this time, if the ragù is still quite liquidy, remove the lid, turn the heat up and simmer for a few more minutes, or until thickened and reduced., Eat straight away, or if you’re making this ahead of time, allow to cool, then divide between containers or plastic freezer bags."

in a pestle and mortar (or finely chop, if you prefer)., Heat a splash of oil in a pan over a low heat, add the onion and fry gently for 10 to 15 minutes, or until soft., Turn the heat up to medium, then add the chilli and tomatoes. Half-fill one of the tomato tins with water, give it a swirl and tip into the pan. Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper and cook gently for 30 minutes, then break up the tomatoes., Whiz the bread (remove the crusts, if you like) in a food processor until fine, then tip into a large bowl. Add the meat, nutmeg, lemon zest, egg yolk and a good pinch of seasoning. Pick, finely chop and add the sage and rosemary, then mix and scrunch together. Shape into little balls, around the size of a gobstopper., Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the meatballs cook until browned over – be careful not to break them up., Once browned, add the meatballs to the tomato sauce, stir carefully to cover, and braise gently for 45 minutes, or until cooked through., Serve each portion scattered with a few raw peas, shavings of pecorino and picked marjoram (if using)."

lamb and mutton, but back in the day – at the right times of the year – they’d also get out there and hunt things like elk, which they’d stew with wild juniper berries. What’s amazing for me is that thousands of miles away in Britain we were hunting deer for venison and stewing that with juniper too. I guess some combos are just brilliant, no matter where you live. Don’t worry if you can’t get venison, because stewing beef will also be delicious. Really nice served with some rice, beans, a jacket potato or flatbreads, or, if you’re a bit more traditional, some nice steamed greens. A humble but delicious stew., Dust a chopping board with 2 tablespoons of flour and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and toss your chunks of meat through this mixture until well coated. Heat a large pan on a high heat, add a few lugs of olive oil and fry your meat for 3 minutes to brown it. Add your chopped onions, carrots, celery, crushed juniper berries, rosemary and the knob of butter. Add a few tablespoons of water, give everything a good stir, then pop the lid on the pan and let everything steam for 4 to 5 minutes so the flavours really mingle together., Take the lid off so your meat and veg start to fry, and stir every so often for 5 to 10 minutes. Chop your parsley stalks finely, and once the onions start to caramelize, add them to the pan with your remaining 2 tablespoons of flour and your crumbled stock cubes. Stir, and pour in enough water to cover the mixture by a couple of inches. Put the parsley leaves aside for later., Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to medium low so that the stew is just simmering. Add your potatoes and slow cook for at least 2 hours with the lid slightly askew, or until the meat falls apart easily. Keep an eye on it as it cooks, and add splashes of water if you think it looks too dry., Put your chopped garlic in the middle of a chopping board. Add most of your parsley leaves with a teaspoon of sea salt and half a teaspoon of black pepper. Chop everything together so you get a kinda chunky paste. Add this to the stew and stir through. Chop the last of your parsley leaves and sprinkle over before serving."

mushrooms, and pick and finely chop the rosemary., Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large ovenproof pan over a low heat, add the onions and fry gently for about 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Turn the heat up, add the garlic, carrots, celery and mushrooms, then mix everything together before stirring in the beef, rosemary, and a pinch of sea salt and 1 level teaspoon of black pepper., Fry fast for 3 or 4 minutes, then pour in the Guinness, stir in the flour and add just enough water to cover., Bring to a simmer, cover the pan with a lid and place in the oven for 2½ hours, or until the meat is very tender and the stew is rich, dark and thick, stirring halfway. A perfect pie filling needs to be robust, so if it’s still quite liquidy, place the pan on the hob and reduce until the sauce thickens., Coarsely grate the cheese, stir half through the pie filling, then transfer to a pie dish and leave to cool slightly., Meanwhile, dust a clean work surface with flour and roll the pastry out to the thickness of a pound coin., Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the pie filling.

Fry until the meat starts to brown then add the bell pepper and onion. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the veggies start to soften – this should take around 5 to 10 minutes., When the veggies are tender, add the tomato purée and stir into the meat, then add the vinegar, brown sugar, honey, mustard and chile powder to the pan and give everything a really good stir. Add the beans, season with salt and pepper, then bring to a boil and cook until the sauce is nice and thick., To serve: pile the Sloppy Joe mix onto the bottom of a bun or middle of a wrap, top it with lettuce and close up the sandwich or roll up the wrap., Serving suggestions:
Delicious served with an Everyday chopped green salad or some Brilliant broccoli., Jamie’s top tips
• Look out for ground beef with around 10% fat – if buying turkey, try to buy the best quality you can afford. Don’t buy poor-quality turkey mince. If your grocery store has a meat counter you can ask them to grind the meat for you.
• This can be made completely ahead of time and reheated just before serving. If you’re reheating Sloppy Joes, add water a little bit at a time to loosen.
• If you want to give it a bit of a kick add some more chile powder or even a chopped fresh chile., Tips from the dietitian:
• Sloppy Joe is a real favorite, but for a healthier version, use lean ground turkey instead of beef – the leaner meat is better for the heart.
• Rinsing beans removes some of the salt but you can also look for low-sodium or no-salt-added beans."

Drain the rice in a sieve, run it under a cold tap to cool, and then allow to dry out in the fridge., Trim any excess fat from your steak and slice the meat into finger-sized strips. Halve and deseed your pepper and cut it into thin strips. Trim and halve your baby corn lengthways. Peel and finely slice the ginger and garlic. Finely slice the chilli. Cut the ends off your spring onions and finely slice. Pick the coriander leaves and put to one side, and finely chop the coriander stalks., Get yourself a big bowl and put in the red pepper, baby corn, mange tout, ginger, garlic, chilli, spring onions, coriander stalks and steak strips. Add the sesame oil and mix everything together., Preheat a wok or large frying pan on a high heat and once it’s very, very hot add half of the groundnut oil and swirl it around. Add all your chopped ingredients from the bowl. Give the pan a really good shake to mix everything around quickly. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, taking care to keep everything moving so it doesn’t burn. Add the black bean sauce, and stir in half the soy sauce and the juice of half a lime. Keep tossing. Taste and season with black pepper., Remove the pan from the heat, transfer everything to a bowl and cover with tin foil., Give the pan a quick wipe with a ball of kitchen paper and put back on the heat. Add the rest of the groundnut oil and swirl it around. Crack in your egg and the remaining soy sauce – the egg will cook very quickly so keep stirring. Once it’s scrambled, stir in your chilled rice, scraping the sides and the bottom of the pan as you go. Keep mixing for a few minutes until the rice is steaming hot, then taste and season with a small splash of soy sauce, if needed., Divide the rice between two bowls or plates. Spoon over the meat and black bean sauce and sprinkle over the coriander leaves. Serve with wedges of lime – great!"

Pick through them and save a small handful, discarding the rest and picking off all the fleshy pulp. Add them to a small pan with a lug of olive oil and fry until golden. Keep to one side., In a pestle and mortar, bash the fennel and coriander seeds and dried chilli flakes with 1 teaspoon of sea salt and a pinch of black pepper until fine., Cut the squash halves into wedges and add to a roasting tray. Tip over the spices, then scatter over the cinnamon. Crumble the chestnuts directly into the tray, then drizzle lightly with olive oil. Toss to coat., Roast in the oven to cook for 30 to 45 minutes, or until beautiful, golden, and soft when you pinch it., When the squash is done, sprinkle over a little salt from a height and carefully tip the golden seeds into the tray, leaving the oil behind in the pan., Pick the rosemary leaves onto a board with a good pinch of salt and pepper and finely chop it all together. Roll the beef about on the board until it’s well coated in the rosemary., Return the pan of oil to a high heat, and once its screaming hot, add the beef. Sear it for 1 to 1½ minutes, so it browns, then turn it over and do the same on the other side. Remember you’re just searing it to get a bit of colour on the outside, not cooking it – it should be blue in the middle., Meanwhile, make the dressing. Add the mustard, 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice to a bowl or mortar and mix well. Have a little taste and check the seasoning then put aside., With a really sharp knife, slice the beef up as thinly as you can without hacking it up or ruining it! Go thicker to do it nicely if you need to. Use the back of a knife to carefully flatten out each slice of beef, then transfer them to a large platter., Sprinkle with a little salt, as the seasoning won’t have got through to the centre of the beef. Arrange the squash pieces over the top, then crumble over the roasted chestnuts and scatter over the seeds., Drizzle everything with a bit dressing (save any leftovers for another day), then lightly dress the salad leaves and pop these on the top. Take it to the table with a block of Parmesan for shaving over."

Carpaccio is usually served raw, but I’m searing the beef to give it a bit of colour., You’ll be able to pick up these ingredients from most good supermarkets but if you can, get yourself down to a specialist Japanese store and pick up a sachet of authentic Japanese spices – use a tablespoon of that instead of the spice mix., Cut your beef fillet in half lengthways then roll each piece tightly in cling film. Pop in the fridge overnight to firm it up and make it easy to cut., The next day, cook your rice according to packet instructions. When you’re ready to cook the beef put a large frying pan on a high heat. Put all of the spice mix ingredients in a pestle and mortar and lightly crush them. Unwrap the pieces of beef, sprinkle them with the crushed spices and pat them down to help them stick. Add a splash of groundnut oil to the pan and sear the beef for 1 minute, turning with tongs until golden on all sides – don’t forget the ends! Transfer it to a board to rest for a few minutes., Meanwhile, mix the tahini, soy, vinegar, icing sugar, a squeeze of lime juice and 1 tablespoon of water in a bowl. Spoon the sticky rice onto a serving board and scatter with the seaweed, if using, and the toasted sesame seeds. Drizzle the sauce on the side., Slice the pieces of beef as finely as you can and lay the slices slightly overlapping on the board. Snip the cress on the side and serve with lime wedges for squeezing over."

Break the garlic bulb into cloves, leaving them unpeeled., Pile all the veg, garlic and herbs into the middle of a large roasting tray and drizzle with oil., Drizzle the beef with oil and season well with sea salt and black pepper, then rub all over the meat. Place the beef on top of the vegetables., Place the tray in the oven, then turn the heat down immediately to 200°C/400°F/gas 6 and cook for 1 hour for medium beef. If you prefer it medium-rare, take it out 5 to 10 minutes earlier. For well done, leave it in for another 10 to 15 minutes., If you’re doing roast potatoes and veggies, this is the time to crack on with them – get them into the oven for the last 45 minutes of cooking., Baste the beef halfway through cooking and if the veg look dry, add a splash of water to the tray to stop them from burning., When the beef is cooked to your liking, take the tray out of the oven and transfer the beef to a board to rest for 15 minutes or so. Cover it with a layer of tin foil and a tea towel and leave aside while you make your gravy, horseradish sauce and Yorkshire puddings."

In a heavy-bottomed ovenproof saucepan, heat a splash of olive oil and gently fry the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, herbs, porcini and cinnamon for 5 minutes until softened slightly. Meanwhile, toss the pieces of beef in a little seasoned flour, shaking off any excess. Add the meat to the pan and stir everything together, then add the tomatoes, wine and a pinch of salt and pepper. Gently bring to the boil, cover with a double-thickness piece of tinfoil and a lid and place in your preheated oven for 3 hours or until the beef is meltingly tender and can be broken up with a spoon. Taste and check the seasoning, remove the cinnamon stick and rosemary sprigs and serve."

You’re not adding anything to the meat so make sure you work it well to create lovely patty shapes. Ask your butcher to mince the steak for you or just pulse it a few times in a food processor., Put a pan on a high heat and add a lug of olive oil. Once hot, add the onion, turn the heat down to low and cook, stirring often, for 30 to 40 minutes, or until soft and sticky., To make the flavoured mayo, simply empty the mayo into a bowl and whisk with the gentleman’s relish. Have a taste and add a squeeze or two of lemon juice., Put a griddle pan or large frying pan on a high heat to get nice and hot. Divide the minced steak into 4 portions, then pat and shape each portion into a burger patty, about 2cm thick. Drizzle the burgers with a little olive oil then add to the hot griddle or frying pan. Turn the heat down to medium and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until nicely charred. Sprinkle them with a pinch of salt and pepper, then turn them over and use the thyme as a brush to coat the burgers with a little mustard. Lay a slice of cheese on each burger so it starts to melt. Cook for another 6 to 8 minutes. These timings will give you blushing burgers, but cook yours for a little longer if you prefer., Meanwhile, put a large frying pan on a high heat and add your bacon. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Transfer it to a plate and carefully wipe the pan clean with a ball of kitchen paper. Toast the buns in the hot pan – you’ll need to do this in 2 batches., Layer up the cheese burgers in the toasted buns with a dollop of flavoured mayo, the bacon and sticky onions. Serve with homemade French fries, salad and a few gherkins, if you like."

12cm deep) with the bay leaves, olive oil and butter on a high heat., Peel, roughly chop and add the onions, with the diced meat, the shin bone and a couple of pinches of sea salt and black pepper. Mix well, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Add the tomato purée, stout, flour and stock and stir until everything comes together to a simmer. Turn the heat down very low, pop the lid on and let it cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally., When the hour is up, stir in the pearl barley. Put the lid back on and simmer for another hour, then remove the lid and simmer for a further 30 minutes, or until the meat shreds easily and the gravy is thick. Spoon away any oil from the top, then stir in the mustard and Worcestershire sauce and finely grate in the cheese. Season to taste., While the stew is ticking away, put the flour, suet and butter into a bowl with a good pinch of salt. Use your thumbs and forefingers to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles cornflake shapes. Lightly stir in 125ml of cold water, then use your hands to gently pat and push it together into a rough dough. Do not overwork it. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and put into the fridge until needed., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Discard the shin bone and ladle the hot meaty stew into the pie dish (24 x 30cm, and about 4cm deep, is about right)., Beat the egg, then use a little to eggwash the edges of the pie dish, then dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour and roll out the pastry about 1cm thick and a little bit bigger than your pie dish. Carefully place on top of the pie, then trim off any overhanging pastry. Pinch and squash the edges of the pastry to the dish., Eggwash the top, and cook the pie right at the bottom of the hot oven for around 45 to 50 minutes, or until your pastry is golden and gorgeous. Serve with steamed drained greens."

garlic","Preheat the oven to 160ºC/300ºF/gas 2., Peel and roughly chop the onion, peel and quarter the parsnips and peel and halve the carrots. Deseed and roughly dice the squash, and peel and halve the Jerusalem artichokes (if using). Pick the sage leaves., Heat a little oil and the butter in a casserole pan on a medium heat, add the onion and sage leaves, then fry for 3 to 4 minutes., Meanwhile, toss the meat in a little seasoned flour, then add it to the pan with all the vegetables, the tomato purée, wine and stock, then gently stir together. Season generously with black pepper and just a little sea salt., Bring to the boil, place a lid on top, then place in the oven until the meat is tender – sometimes this takes 3 hours, sometimes 4 – it depends on what cut of meat you’re using and how fresh it is. The only way to test is to mash up a piece of meat and if it falls apart easily it’s ready., Once cooked, turn the oven down to about 110°C/225°F/gas ¼ and just hold it there until you’re ready to eat., The best way to serve this is by ladling big spoonfuls into bowls, accompanied by a glass of French red wine and some really fresh, warmed bread., Finely grate the lemon zest, pick and finely chop the rosemary and peel and finely chop the garlic, then mix together and sprinkle over the stew before serving. Just the smallest amount will make a world of difference – as soon as it hits the hot stew it will release an amazing fragrance."

Turn up the heat and add the white wine. Let the wine come to the boil, then add the beans and a splash of water, so that the beans are almost covered. Allow to simmer gently for 5 to 10 minutes until the beans are lovely and creamy. Add the parsley, yoghurt and a good lug of the extra virgin olive oil and taste for seasoning., Heat a griddle pan until white-hot, season your steaks and pat with olive oil. Grill a 4cm/1½ inch thick steak for 2 to 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare. You can keep them on there for longer, turning as you go, until cooked to your liking. Remove from the grill on to a dish and rest for 5 minutes. Squeeze over some lemon juice and drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil. Carve the steaks into thick slices. Divide the creamy beans between your plates and place the steak on top, drizzling over some of the resting juices."

Mix with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper and scatter over your clean board. Drizzle olive oil over both sides of the steaks and roll them in the rosemary and seasoning., Put the yoghurt and horseradish into a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper. Squeeze in lemon juice to taste, then add a splash of extra virgin olive oil and mix well. Taste and add a little more horseradish, if needed., Lay the steaks in your hot pan and press them down gently. Cook for about 1 minute, then turn. Cut the garlic clove in half rub over the hot, charred side of the meat., Flip the steaks again after another minute, repeat the garlic rub, and press down again. For medium-rare meat, cook for around 3 to 4 minutes on each side. For well-done meat, cook for a few minutes more., Remove the steaks from the griddle to a plate to rest for a few minutes. Drizzle with a little olive oil to keep them from drying out., Place the steaks on clean plates and spoon a good dollop of the horseradish sauce on top or next to them. Drizzle some of the lovely resting juices on top. Alternatively you can slice the steaks in half at an angle and serve them on a bed of something light and fresh, like a watercress salad, with the horseradish sauce."

Halve the red peppers, remove the stalks and seeds and roughly chop., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large casserole pan on a medium-high heat, add the chopped veg, chilli powder, cumin, cinnamon and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then cook for 7 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly., Drain and add the chickpeas and kidney beans, tip in the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of a spoon, then pour in 1 tin's worth of water. Add the minced beef, breaking any larger chunks., Pick the coriander leaves and put aside, then finely chop and add the stalks to the pan, with the balsamic vinegar. Season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer with a lid slightly ajar for 1 hour, or until slightly thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally., Serve up with fluffy rice or couscous, a hunk of crusty bread, or over a jacket potato, with some yoghurt, guacamole, and wedges of lime on the side for squeezing over. Sprinkle over the reserved coriander, and some fresh chilli, if you like, then tuck in."

roasted peanuts, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper","Soak the noodles in a bowl of warm water until soft, then drain and put back in the bowl., In a hot wok fry the beef and five-spice in the olive oil until brown and crisp, then add the garlic, ginger, prawns and sugar and stir-fry for another 4 minutes., Remove from the heat and stir the wok mixture into the noodles. Add the spring onions, lime juice, fish sauce, chillies, coriander, mint and peanuts to the bowl., Toss well and correct the seasoning — it wants to be quite zingy with the lime juice. Sprinkle with some extra herb leaves if you like and serve cold."

Obviously the better the beef the better the dish. So go for something with good marbling and a bit of integrity. It can be served on a sharing platter with different salads sprinkled on top. The truffle oil’s optional, but the flavour is interesting, so give it a try because it’s something new. This whole dish is impressive and damn tasty., OK, first things first – whack your oven on to its highest heat. For this dish we’re going to cook the meat on the platter it will be served on, so ideally use one of those classic cheap old metal flats or trays. Or you can use regular serving plates instead, if you know they’re heatproof. Rub them with extra virgin olive oil or truffle oil. And now you’re going to prepare the meat. Work with one piece at a time, and put it on a 30cm piece of bin-liner with another piece on top. Using a rolling pin, evenly slap the meat until it’s 4 times the width you started with, but a quarter of the thickness., Lay the meat on your tray, platter or plate right to the edges – you can let it hang over a tiny bit. Put your rosemary leaves into a sieve and run hot water over them to get the oils and flavours going. Put them into a little bowl, pour 3 or 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil on top and massage the leaves with your fingers to get more flavour out of them. Stir the garlic into the rosemary oil, then pat everything evenly all over the meat. The meat can be prepared to this point a few hours in advance, then cling-filmed and kept in the fridge., Now all you’ve got to do is get a little salad together. Tear your rocket and radicchio into a large bowl. Slice your mushrooms as thinly as possible and add them to the bowl., This dish is best put together really quickly at the last minute. All you need to do is put the meat in the preheated oven for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your oven). By the time you’ve dressed the salad, with a little extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper, and put your block of Parmesan on the table with a speed peeler for shaving pieces off it, you can take the meat out of the oven – it should be paler in colour now. The idea is not to cook the meat, it’s simply to warm it through. Scatter the salad over and serve it straight away. Shave over some Parmesan and have a nice glass of wine with it. Tasty, tasty and very gorgeous!"

the burgers a great flavour – give it a bash., Grind up the red chilli in a pestle and mortar, and mix it in a bowl with the onion, tarragon, egg, breadcrumbs, mustard, Parmesan, nutmeg and beef. Shape into four patties and refrigerate for half an hour or so to give them a chance to firm up slightly., When you're ready to cook the burgers, get a frying or griddle pan nice and hot.  Brush the pan with a little oil, season the burgers generously with salt and pepper, and cook them for 10 minutes, turning them carefully every minute or so, until they're nice and pink and juicy, or longer if you like them well done. Make sure they don't break up as you turn them., Meanwhile, roughly chop the lettuce, tomato and cucumber, mix together and set aside. Once the burgers are cooked, split the rolls into two and toast them quickly on the griddle or in a toaster. Sandwich the cooked 'Elvis' burger between the toasted rolls and serve them on individual plates with the gherkins and some of the chopped salad (add a little extra virgin olive oil or dressing if you like) on the side."

If you’re using the oven or barbecue, preheat it now., Peel and finely chop the onions. Put a splash of olive oil into a large frying pan on a low heat and add your onions. Fry for 10 minutes or until the onions have softened, then put to one side to cool completely., Blitz your crackers or bread (remove the crusts first) in a food processor until you get a fine consistency. Oil a clean baking tray and put aside., Put the cooled onions into a large bowl with the rest of the burger ingredients. Use clean hands to scrunch the mixture together really well, then divide into 6 equal balls for burgers and 18 equal balls for sliders., Wet your hands and roll the balls into burger-shaped patties about 2cm thick. Place your burgers or sliders on the oiled baking tray and pat with a little olive oil. Cover them with clingfilm and put the tray into the fridge for at least an hour, or until the patties firm up., This is a good time to make your spicy mayo, so put mayo, yoghurt, ketchup and smoked paprika into a bowl, squeeze in the lemon juice, mix well and put to one side., If using a frying pan or griddle pan, put it on a high heat now and let it get really hot. However you decide to cook your burgers, they’ll want around 3 or 4 minutes per side – you may have to cook them in batches if your pan isn’t big enough., When your burgers or sliders are nearly cooked on one side, add the rashers of bacon – whichever way you’re cooking them – then flip the burgers and cook the bacon until golden and crisp., When the burgers are cooked to your liking and it’s all looking really good, halve your burger buns and warm them through. Put the bacon on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain., Click off the lettuce leaves, wash and spin dry. Slice the tomatoes and gherkins., When everything comes together, pop your burgers or sliders on to their buns, add all your lovely toppings and your spicy mayo (you know how to put a burger together!), then tuck in with a lovely fresh salad, baked potato or potato wedges."

mushroom, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper","For the salsa verde:
Finely chop the garlic, capers, gherkins, anchovies and herbs and put them into a bowl. Add the mustard and vinegar, then slowly stir in the olive oil until you achieve the right consistency. Balance the flavours with freshly ground black pepper, a bit of salt and maybe a little more vinegar., Tie up the stalk ends of your bunch of thyme, place the leafy ends in a pestle and mortar and give it a good bash. This will remove the tasty leaves and leave you with what looks like a miniature broom. Put this to one side. Add your garlic, anchovy fillet and lemon zest to the mortar. Bash to a paste and stir in your olive oil., Your fillet steaks should be about 2.5cm thick. Wrap a piece of bacon around each steak (this gives them a really good flavour) and secure loosely with a piece of string. Peel the mushroom skins off, which only takes a second and helps them absorb the marinade. Brush the steaks and mushrooms with some of your flavoured thyme oil, keeping the rest for the cooking., Try to become instinctive about cooking basic things like steaks and to understand heat, sizes and cuts of meat. Chefs test their meat by the way it looks and the resistance it gives when squeezed. Preheat your griddle pan or barbecue until really hot. I don't want to give you a specific time to cook them, as your steaks may be thicker or thinner than the ones I'm using. Whether using fillets or sirloins, I cook mine for roughly 3 or 4 minutes each side and let them rest for a couple of minutes to give me a medium-cooked steak – you can do them for a little more or less time to your preference., Season the meat on both sides and place on the griddle pan with your mushrooms. Turn every minute, and brush each time with your thyme oil brush. The mushrooms will be cooked after about 6 minutes and should be soft to the touch – cooking them this way means they don't go all soggy but they do have an intense meaty flavour. Once the beef is cooked to your liking, remove the string, divide the steaks between 4 warmed plates with your mushrooms, allow to rest for 2 minutes and put a big dollop of salsa verde over the top."

the spice rub, then cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge for a couple of hours, preferably overnight., When you’re ready to cook, peel and finely chop the onion, and pick the coriander leaves, finely chopping the stalks., Heat a generous lug of oil in a tagine or casserole pan over a medium heat, add the meat and fry for 5 minutes to seal. Add the onion and coriander stalks and fry for a further 5 minutes., Drain and tip in the chickpeas, followed by the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, then pour in 400ml of stock and stir well. Bring to the boil, then cover and reduce to a low heat for 1½ hours., Meanwhile, deseed and chop the squash into 5cm chunks, then destone and roughly tear the prunes. Toast the almonds in a dry frying pan until lightly golden, then tip into a bowl., When the time's up, add the squash, prunes and remaining stock. Give everything a gentle stir, then pop the lid back on and continue cooking for another 1½ hours. Keep an eye on it, adding splashes of water, if needed., At this stage, remove the lid and check the consistency. If it seems a bit too runny, simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, more with the lid off – the beef should be really tender and flaking apart now, so have a taste and season to taste., Scatter the coriander leaves over the tagine along with the toasted almonds. Serve with a big bowl of lightly seasoned couscous and dive in."

I like mine Italian-style, with the meat sliced a little more thickly. This makes it a bit more rustic and you can really taste the quality of the meat. I also like to sear the meat very quickly before slicing it up, as this gives you a contrasting encrusted edge of flavour. It’s lovely with this marinated bean salad – you can simply use green beans, or a mixture of different ones., You don’t need loads of meat for this, just a couple of slices per person, which should allow you to spend a little more on a good-quality piece of beef., Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Drop in the beans and cook for about 5 minutes. When perfectly done, drain them in a colander., To make the marinade, mix the chopped shallot or onion in a bowl with the herbs, mustard, vinegar and 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then add the hot cooked beans and toss. Put to one side to allow the beans to cool down and take on all the fantastic flavours., Place the beef fillet on a chopping board and season it all over with salt and pepper. Run the thyme sprigs under hot water for a few seconds – this will help to release their fragrant oils. Strip the leaves from the stalks and chop them up roughly. Sprinkle the thyme over the fillet, then roll the meat around the chopping board so that any excess seasoning and herbs stick to it., Get a heavy frying pan very hot and add a splash of oil, followed by the beef fillet. Fry for 1 minute only, turning it every few seconds to sear and encrust all the lovely flavourings on to it. Take the meat out of the frying pan and put it on to a plate to rest for a minute. (Once seared, you can serve straight away or you can keep the meat covered on a plate until needed. I prefer not to keep it in the fridge.), Slice the seared fillet with a sharp knife. Lay each slice on a board and flatten as much as you can by pressing down on them with the side of a chopping knife – it works a treat. Lay two or three slices out flat on each plate. Season again lightly and place a pile of beans on top, spooning over some of the marinade. Sprinkle over any leftover herb leaves and drizzle with some good extra virgin olive oil."

Fill the tin with water, swirl around, and pour into the pan., Bring just to the boil, then stir in the meat, season, and cover. Either simmer slowly on the hob or place in the oven for 2 hours, or until the meat falls apart easily., Taste the stew and tweak the seasoning, if needed, then serve with rice or mashed potato, and some lovely veggies, or check out the topping ideas below."

Divide into 6 and pat and mould each piece into a roundish shape, roughly 2cm thick., Place the burgers onto a plate, drizzle with oil, then cover and place in the fridge until needed – this will help to firm them up., To cook the burgers, preheat a large griddle or frying pan for 4 minutes on a high heat, then turn the heat down to medium., Place the burgers on the griddle or into the pan, then use a spatula to lightly press them down, making sure the burger is in full contact with the pan., Cook the burgers for 3 or 4 minutes on each side, depending on how you like them – you may need to work in batches., Meanwhile, wash and dry a few small lettuce leaves, tearing up the larger ones. Slice the tomatoes, peel and finely slice the red onion, then slice the gherkins lengthways as finely as you can., Place all the veg toppings, and the cheese (if using) on a platter and put in the middle of the table with plates, cutlery, ketchup and drinks., Once cooked, remove the burgers to a plate and carefully wipe the pan clean with a ball of kitchen paper., Halve the burger buns and lightly toast them in the pan, then serve up."

room temperature., For the peanut sauce, toast the nuts and sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over a medium heat for a few minutes until lightly golden. Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic., Sprinkle the oregano and cumin seeds into the pan, strip in the thyme, and crumble in the chipotle chilli (or use 1 teaspoon smoked paprika). Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute., Tip into a blender, drizzle in 100ml of extra virgin olive oil, then add the rum, lime juice, fresh chilli (deseed if you like), and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Pour in 200ml of water, whiz until smooth, then have a taste and adjust with a bit more salt, chilli or lime juice, if needed., For the salsa, get yourself a good knife and a big chopping board. Reserve a few coriander leaves, then chop the rest (stalks and all). Pick the mint leaves and chop with the coriander., Peel the garlic, trim the chilli and spring onions and roughly chop the tomatoes, then add to the herbs and chop and mix together until it’s all very fine., Season with salt and pepper, then squeeze in most of the lime juice and add a good lug of extra virgin olive oil. Mix together on the board, then have a taste and tweak, if needed. Scrape into a bowl., For the steaks, get a frying pan, griddle pan or barbecue screaming hot and season both sides of the steaks with salt, pepper and a good drizzle of olive oil., Place the steaks into the pan, turning every minute until cooked to your liking. I’m going to give you some rough timings, but use your intuition: a 200g steak about 2cm thick wants about 2 minutes each side for medium-rare and 3 minutes each side for medium. As it cooks, whip the meat with the sprig of rosemary and rub it with the cut-side of the garlic clove for extra flavour., When the steaks are cooked to your liking, leave to rest for a few minutes, then slice 1cm thick. Spread the peanut sauce over a large serving platter or divide between plates, and place the steak on top., Finish with a few dollops of salsa, and scatter over the reserved coriander. Drizzle over any resting juices and let everyone tuck in. Delicious served with Mexican street salad."

Pulse in the eggs and the breadcrumbs and season generously with sea salt and black pepper. Tip on to a work surface and shape into 8 balls., Strip the leaves from the bottom of the sprigs of rosemary, leaving the leaves on the tops and reserving the stripped leaves. Cut the ends of the rosemary sprigs at an angle and push one through each ball of meat, leaving the tufty, leafy bit sticking out., Cut the tomatoes in half and squeeze out and discard most of the seeds. Chop up a bit more and spread out in 1 or 2 roasting trays. Peel and chop the garlic and add to the trays. Roughly chop the reserved rosemary leaves and add to the trays. Season and drizzle with just a little olive oil., Place a baking rack over each tray and lay the meatloaf balls on top. Put the tray in the oven for 30 minutes or until the meat is cooked and crisp on the outside. Cover the rosemary sticks with foil if they start to look too brown., Serve 1 meatloaf per person with some tomatoes and juices from the tray. (The tomatoes taste fantastic with all the meaty juices from the meatloaf stirred in.) Sprinkle with fresh basil just before serving."
