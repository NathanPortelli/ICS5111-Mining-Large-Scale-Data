Carefully cut the top off the squash and remove all the pulp and seeds. Place in a large roasting tray, cut side up, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, add a few gratings of nutmeg and season with sea salt and black pepper. Rub all over the flesh, cover with foil and roast for 1½ hours or until tender (if you’re using butternut squash, scoop out some of the flesh to make a gully for the sauce all along the length of the squash)., Meanwhile, cut the leeks in half lengthwise and slice. Peel and finely slice the garlic. Place a large pan over a medium heat, melt the butter, and then add the garlic. Once foaming, then strip in most of the thyme leaves and add the bay leaves. Before the garlic takes on any colour, add the green part of the leeks, some salt and pepper, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the white part of the leeks and cook, until starting to soften. Cover, cook for 30 minutes, stirring every now and then. The environment of heat and steam will make them soft, tender and gorgeous., Check the seasoning, then turn it into a super-charged white sauce. Stir in the flour. Add about 375ml of milk and stir until it thickens, then simmer and blip away, until thick and gorgeous., Remove from the heat, grate in the cheeses, then stir until melting and gorgeous. Carefully pour into the squash., Tear the bread into a food processor, blitz into breadcrumbs and tip into a bowl. Blitz the walnuts and then tip into the crumbs and scatter over the sauce., Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden, blipping and delicious., When there’s 5 minutes to go, pick the sage leaves into a small frying pan on a medium-high heat with ½ a tablespoon of oil and fry until crisp., Pick the remaining thyme leaves over the baked squash and decorate with the crispy sage, just before serving. Take it to the table with a big spoon, for everyone to dig in."

Peel and finely slice the garlic and trim, wash and finely slice the white part of the leeks (save the green tops for tasty cooking another day – they work great in soups or stocks)., Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a large shallow casserole pan over a medium heat and add the garlic. Finely slice the basil stalks, then add them to the pan, along with the dried oregano and gently fry for a couple of minutes., Add the chopped leeks to the pan, season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and cook gently for 10 minutes, until softened, stirring regularly and adjusting the heat to low if they start to colour., Tip in the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of your spoon, then half-fill each tin with water, swirl around and pour into the pan. Bring to the boil, then reduce to low and leave to tick away for 15 to 20 minutes., Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water for 8 minutes, then drain, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water., Tip the sauce into a blender with most of the basil leaves (reserving a few to serve) and whiz until smooth (you may need to work in batches), then season to perfection. Return the sauce to the casserole pan, stir through the cooked pasta, loosening with the reserved cooking water if needs be., Finely grate over the cheese, then nestle the frozen spinach into the pasta. Sprinkle over the garlic breadcrumbs and bake for 20 minutes, until the crumbs are golden, the pasta is tender and the sauce is blipping., When it’s cooked, let it sit for a couple of minutes, then sprinkle over the reserved basil leaves, and finish with a final grating of Parmesan. Delicious served with a crisp green salad."

Pick through 320g of kale, discarding any tough stalks, and add to the pan for the last 5 minutes, pushing it down and covering with a lid., Meanwhile, pick the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh mint, then finely chop on a large board with the top leafy half of ½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley. Finely grate over 40g of Parmesan, add 25g of whole almonds, 1 tablespoon each of white wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil, then finely chop and mix together. Toast 4 slices of wholemeal bread, then divide up the herby mixture on top., In batches, carefully pour the contents of the pan into a blender. Put the lid on securely, cover with a tea towel and, holding it in place, blitz until super- smooth., Taste the soup and season to perfection.

Cook for a further 10 minutes, or until starting to soften., Add 1 teaspoon of English mustard, 1 teaspoon of mint sauce and 1 heaped tablespoon of plain flour, stir over the heat for 2 minutes, then pour in 250ml of red wine and let it bubble and cook away., Pour in 1 litre of beef stock, then turn the heat down to low and simmer for 1 hour, or until the lamb is beautifully tender and the sauce is thick and glossy. Leave to cool completely., To make the pastry, sieve 350g of self-raising flour into a large bowl from a height. Chop 175g of cold butter into cubes, then, using your fingertips, gently work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Mix in 150ml of cold water and bring everything together into a dough. Leave to rest in the fridge for at least 10 minutes., Heavily grease a 1.5 litre pudding bowl with butter., Reserving a quarter for the top, roll the pastry out to 1cm-thick and cut out a circle large enough to line the entire pudding bowl, with a 2cm overhang., Strain the lamb stew through a sieve over a clean pan to catch the liquid, gently pressing to help it along, and reserve for your gravy. Tip the pie filling into the pastry-lined bowl., Roll out the remaining pastry and use it to top the pie, then use water and your fingertips to pinch and seal the edges together well., Cover in a large piece of buttered greaseproof and a double layer of tin foil. Tie a double layer of string just beneath the lip of the bowl to make it watertight, then tie another piece across the top to make a handle., Sit the pudding in a large deep pan and pour in enough water to come halfway up the sides. Bring the water to the boil, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and reduce to a simmer for 3 hours. Check the water regularly, and keep topping it up with boiling water, if needed., When the time’s up, lift out the pudding, remove the foil and paper, then carefully turn out onto a plate. Warm through the reserved gravy, then serve with some simple steamed greens."

large shallow ovenproof pan on a medium-low heat with 50g of unsalted butter and a splash of olive oil., Line up 500g of asparagus, trim off the woody ends, then finely slice and add the stems to the pan, reserving the tips for later., Season with sea salt and black pepper, then fry on a medium-low heat for 10 minutes, or until sweet, soft and delicious, stirring regularly and adding a splash of water, if needed., Stir in 50g of plain flour, followed by 2 teaspoons of English mustard, and slowly stir in 800ml of semi-skimmed milk to give you a loose white sauce, then leave to blip away for a few minutes., Stir in 300g each of peas and broad beans and leave to warm through while you rip off, roughly chop and stir in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh mint (15g)., Smash up the veg for 1 minute with a potato masher, then grate in 70g each of Parmesan and Cheddar and add the asparagus tips., Tear in the pasta sheets, mix up really well to coat and separate, then pull some of the sheets to the top to create a top layer – use the back of a spoon to create some dips and wells., Roughly bash the almonds so you have a mixture of fine and chunky bits, then sprinkle on top and grate over the remaining 10g each of Parmesan and Cheddar cheese. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and a few scrapings of lemon zest (if using)., Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. Serve topped with a little dollop of pesto (if using), a crunchy green salad and an extra grating of Parmesan, if you like."

Wash them, then chop into 3cm pieces and transfer to a shallow, snug-fitting casserole pan with the whole bulb of garlic., Score lines in a criss-cross pattern in the pork fat at ½cm intervals across the entire length of the loin (make sure you don’t cut through to the meat). Then rub the loin with half of the marinade and place on top of the leeks. Using a small sharp knife, stab the pork skin all over, rub with a tablespoon of olive oil, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and place on a large baking tray., Reduce the oven temp to 200°C/400°F/gas 6, place the crackling on the top shelf and the pork on the shelf beneath, then roast for 1 hour., Meanwhile, prep the greens. Tear the cavolo nero leaves, discarding the stalks, and finely slice the Savoy cabbage, discarding any tough stalky bits as you go, then finely slice the chard, stalks and all. Cook the cabbage, cavolo nero and toughest chard leaves in a pan of boiling water over a medium heat for 3 minutes, then add the tenderest chard leaves and simmer for 1 more minute., Tip the spinach into a colander, then drain the greens directly over it to wilt. Lay all the greens on a clean work surface to cool, then wrap in a clean tea towel and squeeze out all the excess liquid. Transfer to a board and chop everything finely. Reheat in a pan when ready to serve and dress with salt, pepper and a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar., Remove the pork loin and crackling from the oven and transfer to a board to rest for 30 minutes. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves from their skins into the pan – discarding the skins as you go – then tip in the beans and chickpeas, juice and all. Place on a medium heat on the hob and gently simmer for 5 minutes, until heated through. Stir through the crème fraîche, season to taste and pour in any resting juices from the pork., To serve, spoon the beans onto serving plates and scatter over the cooked greens. Top each plate with two slices of pork, pour over the remaining Salmoriglio sauce and break over the crackling. Serve with a glass of chilled Valpolicella."

Once golden, remove the sausages to a plate, put the leek and apple into the pan and strip in most of the thyme. Add a splash of water, season with sea salt and black pepper, then cover and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally., Drain the potatoes, mash with half the flour, then season to perfection. Lightly rub a 20cm x 28cm baking dish with oil. Once the mash is cool enough to handle, use your fingertips to spread two thirds of it evenly across the base and sides of the dish., Stir the remaining flour into the leeks, then gradually stir in the milk, then the mustard. Simmer for 5 minutes, or until thick and creamy., Slice the sausages 1cm thick and stir most of them into the pan, along with any juices, then evenly spoon into the mash-lined dish., Press the remaining mash on to a sheet of greaseproof paper until just bigger than your dish, then flip over the top of the dish, peel off the paper, trim any excess and crimp the edges with a fork to seal., Poke the reserved sausage slices into the top, then gently brush with 1 tablespoon of oil.

Stinging nettles might sound like a bit of an unusual ingredient, but they’re actually a source of vitamin C, and when handled and cooked properly, they’re nothing to be afraid of — they’ve been used in food and cooking for millennia. The basic rules are to always wear gloves, avoid picking near busy roads or path edges where dogs may have passed, and give them a thorough wash back home. ”",376,13.1g,5.9g,2.7g,0.89g,19.8g,44.6g,1.9g,"500                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Tipo “00” flour                                                                                                                                                                , plus extra for dusting, 5                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range eggs, 250                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                stinging nettles or greens                                                                                                                                                                , such as spinach, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    leeks, unsalted butter, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh marjoram or thyme                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), 1                                                                                                                                                                whole                                                                                                                                                                nutmeg, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Parmesan cheese, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                soft cheese such as ricotta, brie, feta","Start by making the pasta dough. Pile the flour into a large bowl and make a well in the middle. Add the eggs to the well, use a fork to whip up the eggs until smooth (add a tablespoon of cold water, if needed), then gradually bring the flour in from the outside until it becomes too hard to mix. With floured hands, bring it together into a ball of dough., Knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for 4 minutes, or until smooth and elastic (add a touch more water or flour, if needed). Cover with a clean damp tea towel and leave to relax for 30 minutes., For the filling, you’ll need to wear rubber gloves. Rinse the nettles in cold water, then strip the leaves into a large bowl, discarding the stalks. Trim the leeks, halve lengthways, wash and slice 2cm thick., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1 knob of butter, strip in the marjoram and stir in the leeks. Season with a small pinch of sea salt, add a grating of nutmeg, and sweat for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly., Stir the nettle leaves into the pan, allow to wilt down completely (about 5 minutes), then turn off the heat. If using spinach, blanch it in boiling water first, drain in a colander and squeeze out the excess water before adding it to the herby leek pan, then stir through and turn off the heat., Tip the mixture onto a board and chop super-finely. Finely grate over most of the Parmesan, and add the soft cheese, then chop again, mixing as you go., To make the ravioli, take a third of the pasta dough (save the rest in a container in the fridge for tasty cooking another day) and roll out a sheet that is just 1mm thick – use a pasta machine, or do it by hand with a rolling pin., Once you have a thin sheet (you should be able to see your hand through it), lay it out horizontally on a flour-dusted surface in front of you. Place teaspoonfuls of your filling along the lower half of the pasta sheet, 8cm apart. Brush the upper edge of the pasta with water and fold it towards you, covering the filling and pressing around it to remove any air., Use a pasta cutter or knife to cut out the ravioli. Pop them on a flour-dusted tray and repeat with the rest of the dough., Place a large pan of water on to boil with a good pinch of salt. Get a small saucepan on a low heat and add a knob of butter, letting it slowly melt., Reduce the water to a simmer, and cook 6 pieces of ravioli at a time (2 portions) for 1 minute, or until cooked but still with a little bite., Scoop the pasta straight into the buttery sauce, bringing some starchy cooking water with it, toss gently, then spoon on to warmed plates., Finish each portion with shavings of Parmesan. Serve up to your first lucky guests, while you crack on with the next 2 portions."

It might seem stage-y, but when you combine all the different elements in one joyful bowl at the end you’ll be so pleased you went to all that effort. Also, everything here is quick to do, so it’s not a long one in terms of total time. I’ve given you quantities for the veg I used, but you basically want about 600g of crunchy veg in total (as well as the salad). When it comes to the actual stir-frying, it’s best to do no more than 2 portions at a time so you can retain maximum control.

the tough ends off the broccoli stalks, then halve any thicker stalks. Blanch in a pan of boiling salted water for a few minutes, until just cooked, then remove and toss with the sesame oil. If using eggs, cook in the water for 7 minutes, then remove, cool under running water and peel. Place in a reusable bag with the Worcestershire sauce and twist to seal, letting the sauce stain the eggs., Use a fork to scrape down the length of the cucumber, all the way round – this helps the dressing to cling on. Cut at an angle into 1cm slices then, in a bowl, mix with the soy sauce and lime juice. Set aside, turning the cucumber slices occasionally, so they soak up all that lovely flavour., Click the lettuce leaves apart, then wash and place in a bowl of cold water so they remain lovely and crisp. Simply drain and spin dry when ready to serve., Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain, refresh and cool under cold running water, and set aside., Trim the leek and halve lengthways, wash, then cut into 5cm lengths and finely slice – we’re looking for harmony between the size of the veg and the noodles., Peel the carrots. Trim and slice the courgettes and carrots lengthways, then cut into batons., Put a non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat. Toast the nuts as it heats up, removing to a pestle and mortar once golden. Bash until crushed and set aside., Trim the pork of any sinew, then cut into 1½cm thick rounds. Place in the pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and cook for 5 minutes, or until golden and just cooked through, turning halfway. Turn the heat off and spoon over the hoisin sauce, then pile the broccoli at one side of the pan to warm through., Alongside, put a large non-stick frying pan or wok on a medium-high heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil., Sprinkle half the chopped veg, half the peas and beans, and half the noodles into a pan. Stir-fry over the heat for just a couple of minutes, then divide between serving bowls., Portion up some hoisin pork and broccoli, add half an egg to each bowl (if using), with some cucumber and lettuce. Pick over some herb leaves, scatter over some nuts, then drizzle with chilli sauce, to taste. Let two lucky people tuck in, while you rattle out the remaining portions."
Roasted veggie curry | Jamie Oliver recipes,Spiced spinach-stuffed naan,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/106021898.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '8']",10 minutes,"“Roasting the veg before immersing them in a ridiculously tasty sauce really intensifies their natural flavour, giving you even more bang for your buck. I’ve kept things fairly gentle on the spice front so that all my kids will give it a go, but feel free to add extra heat, if you like. I’m also giving you a cheat’s naan, which all my kids fight over. We’re using it as a vehicle to really bring spinach to life, but feel free to stuff with another veg of your choice, or to not stuff it at all! If you’re feeding fewer than 8 people, leftover portions of this curry freeze really well (see tip), so fill your boots.  ”",345,13.6g,6g,12.6g,1.6g,10.7g,47.8g,6.6g,"1

to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., In a large roasting tray, mix the curry paste with a pinch of sea salt, 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon of vinegar., Wash the parsnip, carrots and butternut squash (we’re leaving the skins on). Quarter the parsnip lengthways, remove the fluffy core and chop into bite-sized chunks (about 2cm), adding to the tray as you go., Repeat with the courgette, then chop up the carrots. Deseed the squash and chop to a similar size. Get it all in the tray with the cauliflower and mix until well coated., Roast the veg for 40 to 50 minutes, or until golden, gnarly and cooked through., Meanwhile, for the sauce, put a large shallow casserole pan on a medium heat. Peel and finely chop the ginger and garlic, and place in the pan with 1 tablespoon of oil, stirring regularly., As soon as it starts to colour, stir in the mango chutney. Let it sizzle for a minute, then pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with your spoon. As soon as they start to bubble, add the coconut milk. Bring it to the boil, then turn off the heat., To make the naans, melt the butter in a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat, then add the cloves and cinnamon stick., Trim the leek and quarter lengthways, wash, finely slice and add to the pan, followed by the spinach. Stir regularly, until dark, dry and intense, then remove and leave to cool., Pour the flour into a large bowl with a pinch of salt, make a well in the middle and add 1 mug (300ml) of water (using the same mug you used to measure your flour, a regular cup is fine) and 1 tablespoon of oil. Use a fork to gradually mix the flour into the liquid, until it gets too hard to mix., At this point, use your clean floured hands to knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for a couple of minutes, adding a little extra flour, if needed. You want it to be pliable so don’t add too much flour, but it shouldn’t be sticking to your work surface., Now, oil your surface, then stretch and push the dough out into a 30cm circle. Crumble the feta over the cool spinach mixture and mix together, then place in the middle of the dough, leaving a 5cm border at the edge., Fold in the dough over the filling, patting it together as you go and sealing the filling inside, then pat out to just under 25cm. Wipe out your frying pan, then gently lift the naan into it., Cook the naan at the bottom of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and crisp on the outside, fluffy in the middle., A few minutes before you’re ready to serve, bring the sauce back to a simmer, then add all the roasted veg and the frozen peas, and simmer until the peas are cooked and the sauce is a good consistency., Slice up your naan and serve up with your curry at the table. Nice with a dollop of yoghurt and any chutney or pickles, if you like."

If you’ve got fresh herbs, add some roughly chopped leaves., To assemble, scatter the veg and cheese mixture across four tortillas, then top with the remaining tortillas., Put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat., One at a time, dry fry the quesadillas for 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp on the outside, and the cheese has melted in the middle, turning halfway., Meanwhile, jazz up your houmous. Add half a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon or lime juice to the houmous tub, and mix together. You can add some fresh herbs here if you have any., Let each quesadilla cool for at least a minute before slicing into wedges. Finely slice the chilli, if using. Serve with the jazzed-up houmous and yoghurt for dunking, topped with chilli sauce and the sliced fresh chilli to add a bit of heat, if you like. Great with a fresh, crunchy salad on the side."

Season with sea salt and black pepper., When the leeks are almost done, cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water., Toss the drained pasta into the leek pan, then remove from the heat and wait 2 minutes for the pan to cool slightly while you finely grate the cheese and beat it with the egg (if the pan’s too hot, it’ll scramble; get it right and it’ll be smooth, silky and deliciously elegant)., Loosen the egg mixture with a splash of reserved cooking water, then pour over the pasta, tossing vigorously (the egg will cook in the residual heat)., Season to absolute perfection, going a little OTT on the pepper. Adjust the consistency with extra cooking water, if needed, and finish with a little stroke of cheese. Fantastic served with a glass of cold Italian white wine."

Discard the salty water, rinse the hocks, and repeat once more., Trim and finely slice the leeks, celery and carrots in your food processor or using a mandolin (use the guard!)., Add the veg to a casserole pan with a lug of oil, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and the bay leaves. Sweat over a medium heat for 15 minutes, or until the veg are soft but not coloured, stirring occasionally., Add the drained ham hocks, pearl barley and chicken stock. Bring to the boil then cook, with the lid on, over a medium-low heat for 3 hours, or until the meat is very tender. Check on it occasionally, and top up with more hot stock or water if it gets too dry., Using tongs, transfer the ham hocks to a clean board and carefully remove all the fat and bones. Shred the meat then return it to the broth. Turn the heat up and add the peas., When they’re tender, pick, finely chop and stir in the parsley along with the mint sauce. Serve with bread and English mustard."

Cook for 3 minutes, then add your cavolo nero, kale or cabbage. Cook for another 3 to 3½ minutes, but no more! Don’t be tempted., Using tongs or a slotted spoon, move the veg to a liquidiser – it’s OK if a bit of water comes with it. Add your oil and liquidise until you’ve got a vivid green purée, the same consistency as double cream. If it’s a bit too dry, add a splash of the cooking water. Have a taste, season with sea salt and black pepper, then put aside., Bring the water back to boil, and cook the pasta according to the packet instructions., Drain and return the pasta to the pan, add the sauce and allow it to simmer over a medium-low heat for 30 seconds., As it comes back to the boil, remove from the heat and finely grate in the Parmesan. Be quick, so your pasta doesn’t overcook, then check the balance of cheese, salt and pepper., Finely grate over extra Parmesan, then serve on a big platter and eat as soon as possible."

Peel and slice the garlic, then pick the thyme leaves., Put a large casserole-type pan (ideally one you’d be happy to serve in) on a medium heat and add a drizzle of oil, the butter, thyme leaves and garlic., Cook until it begins to bubble and fry, then stir in the leeks. Continue cooking and checking on it every few minutes to stir and make sure it doesn’t catch., At this point, you have two choices: one is good, one is great. You can either stir the rest of the ingredients into the leeks, grating in the Cheddar and Parmesan, and tearing in the brie, then put it into the oven to cook for 45 minutes uncovered, or, if you want the sweetest leeks in the world (and I think you do), do the following..., Turn the heat under the pan down a little and cook the leeks for about 35 minutes, or until soft and intensely gorgeous, stirring every now and then., Season, then spoon it all into a dish, or leave in the pan., Stir in the cream and splash of water, grate over the Cheddar and Parmesan, then pull the brie into parts and bomb those on top., Pop in the oven for 15 minutes, or until golden and bubbling."

Lightly grease a 20cm x 30cm baking dish with oil., Get the kids to help you cover the baking dish with a layer of pastry, letting the edges overhang slightly. Brush with a little oil, then add another layer of pastry, repeating until you have used it all (there should be 3 or 4 layers)., Boil the kettle, then place the spinach in a colander and pour over the hot water to wilt it (you may have to do this in 2 batches). Push the spinach down with the back of a spoon, then, when it’s cool enough to handle, have the kids squeeze out any excess water, using their hands. Place the spinach on a board and roughly chop, then place in a large bowl and set aside., Put the grill on high and grill the bacon till crisp, then set aside to cool., Whisk the eggs in a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Whisk in the milk and mustard powder, snip in the chives, then grate in the lemon zest., Have the kids crumble the cooled bacon into the spinach and then trim, slice and add the leeks.

Season and set aside., Trim, halve and slice the leeks lengthways, then add the butter, oil, bay leaves and thyme to a wide, shallow saucepan, place over a medium-low heat and bring to a simmer. Add the leeks and cook for 10 minutes, turning, until golden., Pour in the stock and wine, cover with a large circle of baking paper and cook for 15 minutes or until leeks are tender. Remove the pan from the heat and rest the leeks in the liquid., Put the capers in a small saucepan and add enough olive oil to cover them by 2cm. Place it over a high heat and fry until the capers begin to open and crisp up. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the capers to a plate lined with kitchen paper., Heat a griddle pan over medium–high heat. Brush the ciabatta with olive oil and toast until golden, about 1 minute each side., To serve, spread the toasted ciabatta generously with the smoked salmon butter and top with the leeks, fried capers and pick over a few chervil leaves."

Roughly chop the ham., Melt the butter in a pan and sauté the leeks and shallot with half the thyme leaves for 5 minutes, until soft but not coloured – add a splash of water if it starts to stick. Set aside., Cut the broccoli stalks into 3cm lengths and slice the larger florets in half. Blanch in boiling salted water for about 3 minutes, then drain well., Lightly brush a 26cm round quiche tin with a little of the oil, then drape a layer of filo pastry over it, very gently pressing it into the corners, leaving a few centimetres overhanging., Brush the filo with a little more oil, scatter over some of the remaining thyme leaves and layer another piece of filo on top. Repeat layering the oil, thyme and filo until you have a fully lined quiche base – around 4 filo sheets. Bake the case in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes, until just starting to colour., Stir the broccoli and smoked ham through the leek mixture, then spoon the filling over the pastry base., Beat the eggs and milk with a pinch of black pepper, then grate in ¾ of the cheese. Pour it over the veg and ham, grate over the rest of the cheese, then place it on a baking tray and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cooked through., Remove from the oven and leave to stand for 15 minutes before serving with a green salad."

Deglaze with the white wine, then pour in the vegetable stock. Add the leeks and cook for 30 minutes., Tie the beef with kitchen string at 2cm intervals, then attach it to each end of a wooden spoon to create a handle – the string should be just long enough so that the spoon can be balanced on top of the pan while the beef is submerged in the stock., Lower the beef into the pan and poach over a low-medium heat for 15 minutes for rare (20 for medium, 25 for well done)., Take the pan off the heat and transfer the beef to a warm plate. Cover with foil and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the leeks and keep them warm., Peel and finely chop the shallot, and finely chop  the cornichons. Pick and finely chop the herbs., In a bowl, combine the mustard, vinegar, savora sauce and rapeseed oil, then add the shallot, cornichons, capers, and herbs, then season to taste., Slice the beef very thinly, drizzle with the vinaigrette and serve with the leeks on the side."

Peel and finely slice the onion, deseed and finely chop the chilli, and peel and finely chop the garlic., Heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and sauté the onion, chilli, garlic and oregano until softened – about 5 minutes., Season and add the tinned tomatoes, tomato paste and 200ml of water. Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 40 minutes, or until thickened. Transfer the sauce to a bowl until ready to use., For the pastry, combine the flour and a pinch of sea salt in a food processor. Dice and add the butter, then blitz until it resembles breadcrumbs. Beat and add the eggs with about 60ml of cold water to form a dough. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., Roll out the dough 5mm thick and cut out the pastry in circles large enough to line eight 12cm tart tins (or 14 to 16cm x 10cm tins). Lay the pastry in the tins, pushing it down gently, then trim away any excess., Line each tin with baking paper, then fill with baking beans or uncooked rice and bake for 15 to 20 minutes., Remove the paper and beans or rice, then return the tins to the oven and cook for a further 6 to 8 minutes, or until the pastry is golden., Meanwhile, make the kedgeree. Peel and finely grate the ginger, peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then coarsely grate the tomatoes., Place the haddock and bay leaves in a large pan and cover with the milk. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, lower the temperature and simmer for 10 minutes, until cooked. Allow the fish to cool slightly, then transfer it to a bowl and flake into chunks., Cook the rice in salted water for about 15 minutes, then drain and add to the bowl with the haddock., Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, curry and mustard powders and sauté for 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the grated tomatoes, season well and cook for 10 to 12 minutes., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/gas 6., Add the fish, rice, lemon zest and juice to the onion mixture, stir well and cook for a few more minutes. Transfer back to the bowl and allow to cool for 5 minutes., Divide the kedgeree between your tart tins, making a small well in the middle of each one. Crack an egg into every well, place the tins on a baking tray and pop in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking., Meanwhile, make the chilli glaze by deseeding and finely chopping the chillies, and combining it with the oil in a small saucepan and cooking over a medium heat for 10 minutes., Divide the kedgeree tarts between plates. Brush the top of each tart with chilli glaze, pick over the coriander leaves and serve with the tomato and chilli sauce on the side."

Add the peas, stir and cook for 30 seconds., Dice the cooked chicken., To the drained pasta, add the leek mixture, chicken, milk and two-thirds of the ricotta. Mix gently to combine and season with salt and pepper., Spoon the pasta mixture into the baking dish. Top with the remaining ricotta, grate over the Parmesan and drizzle with olive oil, if you like. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes or until piping hot and starting to crisp up on top."

Peel and add the whole onion, along with the lamb., Bring back to the boil, skimming away any scum from the surface. Simmer on a medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the lamb is cooked through., Using a slotted spoon, remove the lamb to a plate and leave until cool enough to handle., While it’s cooling, peel the swede, chop into 1cm chunks, and add to the pan to get a headstart. Peel the carrots and parsnips, slice at a slight angle 1cm thick, and drop them into the pan. Now peel the potatoes and cut into 4cm chunks., Strip all the lamb meat from the bone, and return the meat to the pan with the potatoes. Bring back to the boil, then simmer it all for 15 to 20 minutes, or until almost tender, while you wash the leeks and cut them into 1cm-thick slices., Now you can eat this straight away if you want to – simply stir the leeks into the pan, bring to the boil again, then simmer for 10 minutes with the lid on, or until tender. Taste and season to perfection., For even tastier results, let it chill overnight. In which case, simply stir in the raw leeks, cover, and pop into the fridge, where it will keep for up to 3 days. When you’re ready to serve, gently simmer the cawl until warm through, then season., Either way, ladle into serving bowls and serve with lots of black pepper, a wedge of mature Caerphilly cheese and a slice of good bread and butter for dunking."

Grease a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin with a little butter, then set side., Sieve the flour into a large bowl, then rub in the butter with the tips of your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add 6 tablespoons of cold water, stirring with a knife until it forms a rough dough. Use your hands to bring it together into a ball, then wrap in cling film and pop in the fridge for around 30 minutes to rest., Meanwhile, make the filling. Finely slice the bacon, garlic and leeks. Add the bacon and garlic to a large pan with a splash of olive oil over a medium heat. Pick in the thyme leaves and cook for around 2 minutes, or until lightly golden, stirring occasionally. Stir in the leeks, turn the heat down to medium–low and cover. Cook for a further 20 minutes, or until softened, adding the spinach for the final minute to wilt. Tip the veg and bacon mixture into a large jug. Grate and add the Cheddar, then add the eggs, crème fraîche and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir well, then set aside., On a flour-dusted surface, roll out the dough to roughly ½cm thick. Carefully place into the tart tin and push it into the sides (don’t worry if it breaks – patch up any holes with spare pastry). Trim and discard the excess. Place a double layer of clingfilm on top and fill the tin with baking beans or uncooked rice. Place the tin on a baking tray, then pop in the hot oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove the beans and clingfilm, then return to the oven for a further 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden., Pour the filling into the baked pastry case, then return to the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the filling is almost set. Leave to cool slightly, then carefully remove the tart tin and serve alongside a crisp, green salad."

Place a large roasting tray in the oven to preheat., Carefully remove the hot tray from the oven, then add the oxtail. Season and drizzle over a lug of olive oil, then toss to coat and place in the hot oven for around 20 minutes, or until golden and caramelized., Meanwhile, trim and halve the leeks and celery lengthways, then chop into rough 2cm chunks. Peel and chop the carrots into 2cm pieces, then place into a large ovenproof casserole pan over a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil., Pick, roughly chop and add the thyme and rosemary leaves, then add the bay and cook for around 20 minutes, or until soft and sweet, stirring frequently., Meanwhile, remove the oxtail from the oven and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3., Add the cloves and flour to the veg, stirring well to combine, then pour in the tomatoes and porter (or wine, if using). Add the oxtail and any roasting juices, cover with the beef stock or 1 litre of cold water and stir well., Turn the heat up to high and bring to the boil, then pop the lid on and place in the hot oven for around 5 hours, or until the meat falls away from the bone, stirring every hour or so and adding a splash of water to loosen, if needed., Remove the pan from the oven and leave to cool for about 10 minutes. Using rubber gloves, strip the meat from the bones and return to the pan, discarding the bones., Add a good splash of Worcestershire sauce, season to taste and enjoy with creamy mash and seasonal steamed greens."

beaten","Dad and I had a really interesting conversation about smaller families not wanting whole turkeys for their dinner. So we had a scout around the supermarkets and developed a really delicious and impressive recipe for this. It’s dramatic and stretches the meat a fairly long way. The case of pastry and minced mushrooms keeps the breast moist and delicious and is a little forgiving so the meat holds its juices. You could assemble it a day before and just leave it in the fridge ready to over deliver on Christmas day., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Place the turkey breast upside-down on a board. Gently slice into the natural join of the breast muscle to open it out and make a sort of pocket. Season well and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle over half the thyme leaves, then spread over an even layer of cranberry jam, pushing it into all the nooks and crannies. Fold it back into shape to seal the mixture inside – swiss roll-stylie – and push a few cocktail sticks into the seam to keep it together. Transfer the turkey to a roasting tray, season the outside with the remaining thyme leaves, a good pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Rub it all over, cover in tin foil and roast in the hot oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until just cooked through – using a thermometer, you want it to be 72°C at the thickest point., Meanwhile, soak the porcini in a dish of just-boiled water. After 5 minutes, stir with a fork so any bits of grit sink to the bottom. Add the bacon to a large frying pan with a splash of oil on a medium heat and fry for 5 to 10 minutes, or until beautifully golden and super crispy. Strip in the leaves from 2 rosemary sprigs for the last 30 seconds or so. Remove everything from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat behind. Add the fresh mushrooms to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper. Drain and chop the porcini, saving the water, then stir into the pan. Add a splash of the water, avoiding the grit, then cook for around 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pan starts to sizzle again and the mushrooms are golden, soft and sticky with caramelly edges., To make the gravy, cut the thigh off the turkey leg and slash into it slightly. Throw the leg and thigh into a pot along with the carrot, leek and onion. Stir in the flour, add a good pinch of salt and pepper and 2 litres of boiling water. Add a heaped tablespoon of cranberry jam, the balsamic vinegar and remaining rosemary sprig. Bring back to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for around 2 hours, or until thick. Strain it through a sieve and reheat before serving., When the mushroom pan is dry, add a knob of butter and toss to coat.  Tip the mushrooms into the food processor and whiz until you get a good mixture of smooth and chunky. Leave to cool. Once the turkey breast and stuffing have cooled, you can get on with assembling the wellington., Dust a clean surface with flour, then roll out each packet of puff pastry to the size of a shoe box (one will be the base, one the lid – roll the lid ever so slightly bigger). Line a large roasting tray with greaseproof paper, dust with flour, then add the smaller piece of pastry. Spread half of the mushroom stuffing onto the middle of the base to cover an area the same size as your turkey breast. Remove the cocktail sticks, then place the turkey breast on top and spread the remaining stuffing over the top packing it all in and smoothing it out so that the whole breast is covered.  Sprinkle with the crispy bacon and rosemary, then brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg. Lay the second sheet of pastry over the top, gently mold it round the shape of the breast, pushing all the air out and seal together. Trim the edges  to around 4cm, then pull, twist, tuck and pinch in the pastry (like in the picture)., Brush the whole thing with beaten egg then all the hard work’s done. Leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight until you’re ready to cook. On Christmas day, cook at 180°/350°F/gas 4 for 50 to 60 minutes, or until risen, puffy and beautifully golden and the turkey is piping hot throughout. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for around 10 minutes before carving. Serve carved into 2.5cm with the gravy and all the usual. Christmas in a mouthful."

Heat a large saucepan and add a splash of olive oil. Add the leeks and sliced red onions, and sweat, slowly, until soft – about 10 minutes. Add the chopped spinach and briefly cook until wilted down. Set aside to cool slightly, then drain off any excess liquid in the pan., Mix the ricotta into the leek and onion mixture and season with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper., Spoon a quarter of the base tomato sauce into the bottom of 6 individual ovenproof dishes, or into a 3-litre ovenproof dish. Cover with sheets of lasagne. Spread half the leek and ricotta mixture over the lasagne, then add a third of the remaining tomato sauce. Repeat with more lasagne sheets, the remaining leek and ricotta mixture and then half the remaining tomato sauce. Finish with a final layer of lasagne sheets, then spread the rest of the tomato sauce over the top., Tear the mozzarella into small pieces and dot over the top of the lasagne. Sprinkle with the Parmesan. Place on a baking sheet and bake the individual lasagnes for 25–30 minutes or the large one for 45 minutes – they need to be cooked through and golden brown on top."

Drain, cover and set aside., Meanwhile, add a lug of oil to another saucepan and add the leeks. Sweat gently for about 5 minutes, until soft. Add the milk and bring to the boil then turn the heat off and add to the potatoes. Mash well and season to taste. Cover and set aside., Preheat the grill to medium. Add a splash of oil to a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the sage leaves until crisp. Remove and set aside. Add some more oil to the pan and sauté the onions for 5 minutes, then add the cranberries, cinnamon and a splash of water. Simmer for 10–15 minutes, stirring, until the onions are soft and the chutney has reduced. Add the ginger and vinegar and cook for 30 seconds.

It’s not a pretty-boy pie; it’s a proper, old-school pie that everyone will be over the moon to see on the table. I’m putting leftover white turkey meat to good use here, but you could also mix brown meat in there too., Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Put your bacon in a large pan on a medium heat and add your thyme leaves. Add a lug of olive oil and let it all fry off a few minutes. Add all of your prepped leeks and fry them off for about 3 minutes. Add a pinch of salt and pepper then pop the lid on top, turn the heat down to medium and let them cook away gently for 30 minutes, stirring every 5 to 10 minutes to make sure they don’t catch. There’s going to be enough moisture in the leeks to keep them happy in the pan so they should be soft and melt in your mouth once they’re done., When your leeks are ready, add the turkey meat to them and stir. If you’ve got a bit of stuffing mixed in there you can put that in too. Add the flour, mix it in well then pour in your stock and stir again. Add the crème fraîche then turn the heat up and bring everything back up to the boil. Have a taste and add a bit more salt and pepper if it needs it then turn the heat off. Pour the mixture through a sieve over another large empty pan and let the wonderful gravy from the mixture drip into the pan while you roll out your pastry., Get a deep baking dish roughly 22 x 30cm. Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with a bit of flour and roll your pastry out so it’s about double the size of your dish. Crumble the chestnuts over one half of the pastry then tear a few of the sage leaves over the chestnuts. Fold the other half of pastry on top then roll it out carefully and evenly so you have a rectangle big enough to cover your baking tray. Don’t worry if a few bits stick out here and there., Spoon that thick leek mixture from your sieve into the pie dish and spread it out evenly. Lay your pastry on top, tuck the ends under then gently score the pastry diagonally with your knife. Add a pinch of salt to your beaten egg then paint this egg wash over the top of your pastry. Pop your pie in the oven for about 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is puffed up and golden brown.  When the pie is ready, re-heat the lovely gravy and serve with your pie, along with some peas tossed in butter, lemon, salt and pepper and everyone’s happy!"

Stand the tomatoes next to each other in the tray, on top of the garlic and basil, then push the bay leaves well into the scores in the tomatoes and season well. Lay the leeks on a board and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Using a rolling pin, press down on top of the leeks to really squeeze the seasoning into them. This will also loosen their texture. Weave the leeks in and around the tomatoes. Pour over the balsamic vinegar, drizzle over the olive oil, and bake in the preheated oven for an hour. Before serving, remove the bay leaves., Try this: These tomatoes are great served as a vegetable dish, or as part of a warm salad. Also good as a base for soup, puréed to make a sauce or served over pasta."

Using a second knife, slice the squid across at 1cm intervals, as if you’re cutting to cut it into rings. You won’t be able to cut all the way because of the other knife., Light your barbecue or preheat a griddle pan to hot. Preheat your oven to full whack (240°C/475°F/gas 9)., Parboil the baby leeks for 3 minutes in a pan of boiling salted water, drain in a colander and let them steam dry. Dress them with some olive oil and a pinch of sea salt., Cook the leeks on the barbecue or in the griddle pan on both sides until nicely marked, then add the fennel wedges and chargrill these dry on both sides until they are also marked., Add the radicchio leaves and dry grill these on both sides to wilt them – 30 seconds on each side should do. Put the leeks fennel and radicchio into a large bowl - they might look a bit sad, but don’t worry because you’re going to pep them up!, For the chorizo dressing, heat a frying pan with a couple of lugs of olive oil. Fry the chorizo until the fat renders out, add the rosemary and garlic, toss and take off the heat after 30 seconds. Add the balsamic vinegar and half the lemon juice to the pan, mix and put to one side., Drizzle some olive oil over each squid, sprinkle with some salt and pepper and toss well. Preheat an ovenproof pan on the hob, pour in some olive oil and toss the reserved tentacles in the oil for 1 minute. Add all 4 squid and whack the pan in the preheated oven for a few minutes or until cooked and lightly browned., Pour the chorizo dressing over your chargrilled veggies and add a good squeeze of lemon juice. Take the squid out of the oven., Serve each of your guests a nice pile of the dressed veggies, a concertina squid, some tentacles and half a lemon.

Put 1 chicken breast, skin removed, in a bowl. Trim and wash a large leek, remove the outer leaves, then slice it into 0.5cm/¼ inch pieces. Add these to the bowl with the leaves of a few sprigs of fresh thyme, a good lug of olive oil, a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and a small swig of white wine and toss together. Place your leek and flavourings from the bowl into the tray, then wrap the chicken breast in 4 slices of pancetta. This will not only flavour the chicken but also protect it while it cooks. Try and bend the sides of the tray in towards the chicken so the leeks don't burn during cooking. Drizzle with olive oil, place a couple of whole thyme sprigs on top and cook in the middle of the oven for 25 to 35 minutes."

I like to serve 4 or 5 baby leeks per person, depending on their size. Lightly trim both ends and peel back the first or second layer of leaves and discard. Drop the leeks in a pan of boiling salted water for 2 to 3 minutes to soften - this is called blanching. Drain them well (if there's too much water in them they won't roast properly) and toss in a bowl with a good lug of olive oil, a splash of red wine vinegar, the chopped thyme leaves and the garlic. Arrange the leeks in one layer in a baking tray or earthenware dish and roast in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes until golden and almost caramelized. Keep your eye on them - I've seen many chefs burn baby leeks when cooking them this way and it drives me mad!"

I remember looking at the pile of shells and thinking, I’m never going to eat those, but my mum said, ‘Don’t look at them, darling, just eat them,’ so I did. Once I figured out how to use an empty shell as pincers to grab the meat from the other shells, I went through the whole bowl in no time flat. Mussels are one of the most sustainable types of seafood. They can be cultivated on a large or small scale, they clean the water around them, take literally 4 minutes to cook and are nutritious and wonderful to eat … I can’t think of any negatives! What are you waiting for?, Quickly wash and debeard all the mussels (pull off any bits that look like wire wool), discarding any that won’t close (your fishmonger will do this for you if you ask in advance). Trim, wash, then finely slice the leek and the stick of celery, reserving any of the delicate yellow leaves for sprinkling over later. Put a really wide, deep pot on a medium heat and add a lug of olive oil and a knob of butter, along with the sliced leek and celery. Cook and stir for 10 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened, then flake in the smoked haddock and pour in the whisky – feel free to light it with a match to burn off the alcohol if you want. I think this adds to the flavour, but don’t set yourself on fire., Next, add the mussels and single cream. Stir and shake the pan, put the lid on and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or literally just until the mussels have all popped open – discard any that haven’t. Use a slotted spoon to move them to a large serving platter or bowl. Leave the pan of cooking liquor on the heat and let it bubble away until it thickens to a consistency you’re happy with. While that’s happening, roughly chop the parsley, then add it to the pot and shake it about. Have a quick taste of the sauce, correct the seasoning if it needs it, and pour all over the mussels. Scatter over any celery leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve straight away with fresh or toasted hunks of bread for a beautiful hearty lunch or dinner."

Turn up the heat and add the white wine. Let the wine come to the boil, then add the beans and a splash of water, so that the beans are almost covered. Allow to simmer gently for 5 to 10 minutes until the beans are lovely and creamy. Add the parsley, yoghurt and a good lug of the extra virgin olive oil and taste for seasoning., Heat a griddle pan until white-hot, season your steaks and pat with olive oil. Grill a 4cm/1½ inch thick steak for 2 to 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare. You can keep them on there for longer, turning as you go, until cooked to your liking. Remove from the grill on to a dish and rest for 5 minutes. Squeeze over some lemon juice and drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil. Carve the steaks into thick slices. Divide the creamy beans between your plates and place the steak on top, drizzling over some of the resting juices."

She inspired me to think of grilling as a really exciting way to prepare vegetables., Wash all your vegetables. Heat the barbecue or a griddle pan, put your whole peppers on it, and get them really black on all sides. While still hot, put them in a bowl, cover with cling film and leave to cool., Slice your courgettes lengthways about 0.5cm thick and do the same with your fennel, reserving the herby tops. Grill the courgette and fennel together on the griddle pan for about a minute on each side or until nicely charred. You don’t want them too black or too raw. Transfer to a clean tea towel in one layer, making sure they don’t sit on top of each other, otherwise they will steam and go soggy., Cut the aubergine across into slices 1cm inch thick. Every now and again you get an aubergine that is really seedy — if this happens, it will be bitter and no good, so throw it away and get yourself another one. Chargrill the aubergine slices, turning them 4 times until nicely marked, then transfer to the tea towel., Boil the baby leeks in salted water until they’re just cooked. Then drain, rub with a little olive oil, and chargrill them quickly until lightly marked., Peel the peppers but don’t hold them under the tap as all the sweet fantastic flavour will go down the drain. Carefully rub off the black skin, then remove the stalk and pips and tear the peppers up into large strips. Now put all the vegetables into a large bowl., Take about a quarter of your basil leaves and bash them in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of seasoning until you have a smooth pulp. Add about 8 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar, to taste. Pour this over the vegetables and toss quickly so that everything gets coated in the lovely basil oil, then throw in the remaining whole basil leaves. Slice the garlic really thinly to give you a delicate flavour and add to the bowl with the fennel tops. Mix everything together, and serve on a large plate at room temperature. Great with any grilled fish or meat, or as part of an antipasti plate with some toasted bruschetta and some fresh buffalo mozzarella."
