coriander and chilli in a mixing bowl. Season with salt and black pepper and leave for about 10 minutes before serving. This will allow the flavours to marinate and will also remove some of the liquid from the cucumber, providing a less watery crunch., Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat and cook the onion for 3–5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft. Add the grated broccoli stem, lentils, garlic and sundried tomatoes and cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring occasionally., Add all the remaining ingredients and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens and begins to stick to the pan. Stir in 1–2 tablespoons of water for the last minute of cooking. Remove from the heat and cover with a lid while you warm the tortillas., To serve, spoon the lentil and broccoli stem mixture onto warm tortillas and top with Cucumber Salsa, fresh coriander and basil, with lime wedges on the side."

Scrub the squash (there’s no need to peel it), carefully halve it lengthways and deseed, then chop into 2cm chunks., Place the squash in a roasting tray, pick and chop most of the marjoram leaves, then toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Roast for 1 hour, or until soft and caramelised., With 20 minutes to go on the squash, simmer the stock over a low heat. Peel and finely chop the onion and celery, then place in a high-sided pan on a medium heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring regularly, then stir in the rice to toast for 2 minutes., Pour in the wine and stir until absorbed. Add a ladleful of stock and wait until it’s been fully absorbed before adding another, stirring constantly and adding ladlefuls of stock until the rice is cooked – it will need 16 to 18 minutes., Remove the squash from the oven and mash up with a fork – I like to do half smashed and leave half chunky, then stir through the risotto about halfway through., Meanwhile, trim the broccoli, halving any larger stalks lengthways to help it cook evenly. Steam for 2 minutes, or until just cooked but still full of colour, then toss with the lemon juice and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and season to perfection., When the risotto is done, add enough extra stock or boiling kettle water to make the risotto oozy, then finely grate in the Parmesan, and beat in with the butter., Cover the pan, turn off the heat and leave to relax for 2 minutes. Stir, season to perfection, then divide between your plates., Pick over the remaining marjoram and serve topped with the broccoli. Lovely."

I’ve given you quantities for the veg I used, but you basically want about 600g of crunchy veg in total (as well as the salad).

the tough ends off the broccoli stalks, then halve any thicker stalks. Blanch in a pan of boiling salted water for a few minutes, until just cooked, then remove and toss with the sesame oil. If using eggs, cook in the water for 7 minutes, then remove, cool under running water and peel. Place in a reusable bag with the Worcestershire sauce and twist to seal, letting the sauce stain the eggs., Use a fork to scrape down the length of the cucumber, all the way round – this helps the dressing to cling on. Cut at an angle into 1cm slices then, in a bowl, mix with the soy sauce and lime juice. Set aside, turning the cucumber slices occasionally, so they soak up all that lovely flavour., Click the lettuce leaves apart, then wash and place in a bowl of cold water so they remain lovely and crisp. Simply drain and spin dry when ready to serve., Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain, refresh and cool under cold running water, and set aside., Trim the leek and halve lengthways, wash, then cut into 5cm lengths and finely slice – we’re looking for harmony between the size of the veg and the noodles., Peel the carrots. Trim and slice the courgettes and carrots lengthways, then cut into batons., Put a non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat. Toast the nuts as it heats up, removing to a pestle and mortar once golden. Bash until crushed and set aside., Trim the pork of any sinew, then cut into 1½cm thick rounds. Place in the pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and cook for 5 minutes, or until golden and just cooked through, turning halfway. Turn the heat off and spoon over the hoisin sauce, then pile the broccoli at one side of the pan to warm through., Alongside, put a large non-stick frying pan or wok on a medium-high heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil., Sprinkle half the chopped veg, half the peas and beans, and half the noodles into a pan. Stir-fry over the heat for just a couple of minutes, then divide between serving bowls., Portion up some hoisin pork and broccoli, add half an egg to each bowl (if using), with some cucumber and lettuce. Pick over some herb leaves, scatter over some nuts, then drizzle with chilli sauce, to taste. Let two lucky people tuck in, while you rattle out the remaining portions."

Peel and bash in the garlic, then pound in the almonds until fine., Muddle in 4 tablespoons of oil, finely grate in the Parmesan, then squeeze in the lemon juice. Season to perfection, and tweak to your liking., Scrub and finely slice the potato, trim just the stalks off the beans, then place both in a pan of boiling salted water with the tagliatelle and cook according to the pasta packet instructions., Prep the delicate summer veg as necessary, adding them to the pan for the last 3 minutes. Drain, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water, then toss with the pesto, loosening with a splash of reserved cooking water, if needed., Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, and finish with the remaining basil and a fine grating of Parmesan.

Pulse in the squash, then season to taste., One by one, lightly wet the edges of the wonton wrappers with your finger, add 1 heaped teaspoon of filling to the middle of each, and pinch together to seal (don’t stress if they tear every now and again), placing them in a large oiled nonstick frying pan as you go., Put the pan over a high heat, then pour over 150ml of water and cover. Let it steam until the water has completely evaporated, then uncover and allow to fry, removing as soon as the bottoms are golden and crisp., Meanwhile, peel the remaining ginger, finely grate with the chilli, and place in a small dipping bowl. Trim and finely shred the spring onions, toast the sesame seeds, then serve with soy, mustard and lime wedges."

Peel the stalks, trim off the dry end and throw this away. Peel and chop the garlic., Finely chop the broccoli stalk and put into a large pan with the garlic, anchovies and half the butter. Crumble in the chilli, cover with a lid and cook slowly for 8 to 10 minutes while you cook the pasta in boiling salted water according to the packet instructions., Something I like to do which is slightly different (but better, I’d like to think) is to cook the broccoli florets with the pasta for the last 4 minutes – this makes them soft enough to eat but leaves them with great colour and texture., Drain the pasta and broccoli, saving a little of the cooking water, then toss into the other pan. Remove the pan from the heat., Season to taste with sea salt, black pepper, the rest of the butter and finely grate in a large handful of Parmesan. Mix well, adding a little of the cooking water, to loosen, if needed, and make it shine., Serve immediately, sprinkling with another good handful of finely grated Parmesan."

Strip the thyme and half the rosemary leaves into a pestle and mortar, then bash up with the bay, juniper berries, a pinch of sea salt and ½ a tablespoon of black pepper., Muddle in 6 tablespoons of oil, then rub all over the birds. Roast for 1 hour., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion, carrots and celery. Wash, trim and finely slice the white part of the leeks (save the green for making stock or soup) and the bacon. Peel the potatoes and cut into 2cm chunks., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large pan on a medium heat, add the bacon to render out the fat, then strip in the remaining rosemary. Once golden, add the onion, carrots, celery and leeks, then cook for 45 minutes on a medium-low heat, or until softened, stirring occasionally and adding the potatoes halfway through., For the pastry, put the flour and a good pinch of salt into a bowl with the suet, cube and add the butter, then use your thumbs and forefingers to rub the fat into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs., Beat the eggs, then, reserving just enough to eggwash the pie, stir into the bowl with 180ml of ice-cold water. Use your hands to gently bring it together into a ball, but don’t overwork it. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes., When the time’s up, remove the birds from the oven. When cool enough to handle, pick all the meat, discarding the skin and bones. Sieve the tray juices into the stock., Reduce the oven temperature to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3., Stir the flour into the veg for 1 minute, then pour in the cider and cook for 10 minutes, or until slightly reduced., Shred the meat and stir into the veg pan, then add the stock. Season well, bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes, or until thickened., Carefully drain the liquid through a coarse sieve into a pan, skimming away any fat from the surface. Leave to cool., Grease the bottom of a pie dish (25cm x 30cm) with a little oil. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry on a clean flour-dusted surface to ½cm thick and use it to line the pie dish., Stir 300ml of the strained gravy through the meat and spoon into the dish. Eggwash the edges., Roll out the remaining pastry to ½cm thick and a little bigger than the pie dish, then carefully place on top of the pie, trimming off any overhang. Pinch the edges to seal and make two small incisions in the centre for the steam to escape. Use any spare pastry to decorate the pie, if you like., Eggwash the top, then bake at the bottom of the oven for 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden and the pie is piping hot., To serve, reheat the remaining gravy, skimming off any fat from the surface, and serve alongside the pie. Delicious with creamy mashed potato and seasonal mustardy dressed greens."

teaspoon of cornflour until smooth. Chop the pineapple and peaches into bite-sized chunks and put aside., Pull off the chicken skin, lay it flat in a large, cold frying pan, place on a low heat and leave for a few minutes to render the fat, turning occasionally. Once golden, remove the crispy skin to a plate, adding a pinch of sea salt and five-spice., Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 3cm chunks and place in a bowl with 1 heaped teaspoon of five-spice, a pinch of salt, 1 teaspoon of cornflour and half the lime juice. Peel, finely chop and add 1 clove of garlic, then toss to coat., Next, prep the veg: trim and roughly slice the asparagus and broccoli at an angle, leaving the pretty tips intact. Peel the onion, cut into quarters and break apart into petals, then peel the remaining clove of garlic and finely slice with the chillies. Deseed and roughly chop the peppers, then peel and matchstick the ginger., Place the frying pan on a high heat and cook the chicken for 5 to 6 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway, then leave on a low heat., Meanwhile, place a wok on a high heat and scatter in the pepper and onion to scald and char for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of oil, followed by the peaches, pineapple, ginger, garlic, most of the chillies, the baby sweetcorn, asparagus and broccoli., Stir-fry for 3 minutes, then pour in the sauce. Cook for just a few minutes – you want to keep the veg on the edge of raw – adding a good splash of boiling water to loosen the sauce, if needed., Drizzle the honey into the chicken pan, turn the heat back up to high, and toss until sticky and caramelized. Plate up the veg and top with the chicken. Clank up the reserved crispy skin, and scatter over with the remaining chilli., Pick over the coriander leaves and serve right away, with lime wedges for squeezing over. Good with classic fluffy rice."

Mix in the tahini, red wine vinegar, honey and 2 tablespoons of oil, then season to taste and set aside., Remove and discard any hard stalks from the kale, placing the leaves in a large bowl. With your hands, massage in a pinch of salt for 1 minute., Once the broccoli has charred, add to the kale and tip over half the dressing. Add the quinoa and toss together., Put the pan you used to cook the broccoli back over a high heat and toast the hazelnuts until golden, then roughly chop., Add a little more dressing to the salad, toss again, then arrange on a large serving platter., Peel the remaining orange, slice into rounds and scatter over the salad. Tip over the chopped toasted hazelnuts and serve straight away, with any remaining dressing on the side."

Give the mixture a final blitz, then halve the lemon and add a squeeze of juice to taste, then season with a pinch of black pepper., Scrub the potatoes, then trim the beans and broccoli. Cook the potatoes in a large pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until tender, adding the beans and the broccoli for the final 5 minutes., Meanwhile, heat a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Rub the salmon fillets all over with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place in the hot pan, skin-side down, turn the heat down to medium and cook for 4 minutes, or until the skin is golden and crisp., Turn the fillets over, then cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes, or until just cooked through. Remove the pan from the heat, rest for 30 seconds, then add a good squeeze of lemon juice and give the pan a shake., Drain the vegetables well, then tip into a large bowl. Add the pesto, then toss to coat., Divide the salmon and vegetables between plates, drizzle over the pan juices, then cut the remaining lemon into wedges for squeezing over."

Take care not to burn them., If using salted anchovies, rinse and dry them. Run your thumb gently along the backbone to release it, and you should be able to easily pull it out. If using anchovies in oil, drain them., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, put in the broccoli and cook until just tender. Lift out (retaining the cooking water for the pasta), and put into some iced water to stop the cooking and keep the bright green colour. Drain the broccoli from its iced water and pat dry., Heat the garlic oil in a pan, add the anchovies and stir with a wooden spoon to ‘melt’ them, taking care not to let them burn. Add the toasted crumbs and set aside., Heat the olive oil in a large pan and add the garlic, chilli and broccoli, and stir until heated through. Season, add the pine nuts and sultanas, and cook for a few more minutes., Meanwhile, bring the broccoli’s cooking water back to the boil, add the pasta and cook for about a minute less than the time given on the packet., Drain, reserving some of the cooking water, and add to the pan of broccoli, tossing together well for another minute and adding a little cooking water to loosen., Grate and scatter over the two cheeses, along with the reserved anchovies and the breadcrumbs."

Pick over a few large mint leaves and throw on a good pinch of salt and pepper., Chop, chop, chop until you have finely chopped greens. Scrape these straight into your lunchbox, pour the uncooked couscous on top and gently sit a lemon half in it., Toast the seeds in a dry frying pan, then mix with the cumin and wrap in clingfilm, so they stay crisp until you’re ready to eat., In a small jar, add the juice from the remaining lemon half, a good swig of olive oil (twice as much oil as juice is a good ratio), the harissa and a few small mint leaves, then crumble in the feta. Mix well, screw the lid on and put in your lunchbox., At lunchtime, boil the kettle. Take the lemon, seeds and jar from your lunchbox, then pour in boiling water to just cover the couscous., Pop the lid on and wait 8 to 10 minutes until the water is absorbed and the spinach is wilted. Squeeze in the lemon juice, pour over the dressing and mix with a fork. Sprinkle with seeds before eating."

lightly score the skin, then lightly score the scallops in a criss-cross pattern. Peel the prawns, leaving the heads and tails on (for bonus flavour), then run the tip of a knife down their backs and pull out the vein. Put it all into a bowl., Pick through the mussels and clams, discarding any that remain open when tapped. Put aside in a separate bowl., To make the marinade, trim the lemongrass, peel the garlic and ginger, then roughly chop with the lime leaves, half the chilli (deseed first, if you like) and the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves). Scrape into a pestle and mortar and bash to a smooth paste., Muddle in the fish and soy sauces, squeeze in the juice of 1 lime, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., Quarter the bok choi, halve the sugar snaps lengthways, trim the broccoli, then slice the choi sum into 5cm chunks., Tear off a 60cm-long piece of wide tin foil and place a slightly smaller piece of greaseproof paper on top. Pile on the greens, add the fish and seafood, then drizzle over the marinade., Beat the egg and brush it around the foil edges, then place another large piece of foil on top. Leaving about 5cm around the filling, fold in the foil to create a sealed parcel., Place on a baking tray, being careful not to pierce the foil, and place the tray on the bottom of the oven for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, put the rice and coconut cream into a medium pan with twice the volume of boiling salted water. Bring to the boil, then cover and cook on a low heat until tender., Remove the fish parcel from the oven and very carefully cut it open (mind out for the steam!). Place on a platter, discarding any mussels or clams that haven’t opened., Finely slice and scatter over the remaining chilli, tear over the coriander leaves, and serve with the rice and lime wedges for squeezing over."

Rinse and drain the black beans., Heat the oil in a wok until smoking hot. Drain the pork strips (reserve the marinade) and add to the wok. Stir-fry for 1 minute, then stir in the garlic, chilli and ginger and continue cooking for 1 more minute., Throw in the greens, spring onions and black beans along with the reserved marinade, and continue to stir-fry over a very high heat for a few minutes, until the vegetables just begin to soften. Add a splash of water if it starts to stick., Serve your stir-fry on a bed of steamed or sticky rice, with an extra splash of soy sauce, if you like."

Roughly chop the ham., Melt the butter in a pan and sauté the leeks and shallot with half the thyme leaves for 5 minutes, until soft but not coloured – add a splash of water if it starts to stick. Set aside., Cut the broccoli stalks into 3cm lengths and slice the larger florets in half. Blanch in boiling salted water for about 3 minutes, then drain well., Lightly brush a 26cm round quiche tin with a little of the oil, then drape a layer of filo pastry over it, very gently pressing it into the corners, leaving a few centimetres overhanging., Brush the filo with a little more oil, scatter over some of the remaining thyme leaves and layer another piece of filo on top. Repeat layering the oil, thyme and filo until you have a fully lined quiche base – around 4 filo sheets. Bake the case in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes, until just starting to colour., Stir the broccoli and smoked ham through the leek mixture, then spoon the filling over the pastry base., Beat the eggs and milk with a pinch of black pepper, then grate in ¾ of the cheese.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Once hot, tip in the ciabatta and toss well to coat in the oil., Cook gently for 5 to 10 minutes, or until crisp and golden; try to resist adding more oil – they will turn golden given a bit of time. Tip onto a plate, then wipe out the pan with kitchen paper and set aside., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, then add the broccoli and cook until just tender (about 5 minutes for purple sprouting or 3 minutes for tenderstem)., Fill a bowl with cold water, then lift the broccoli from the pan and into the cold water to cool. Keep the pan of water on the hob., Gently lower the eggs into the pan of boiling water and simmer for 
6 minutes, or until they are just soft in the middle. Drain and set aside., Tip the broccoli into a colander, then cool the eggs in a fresh bowl of cold water for a few minutes., Next, combine 1 tablespoon of oil with the mustard, vinegar and sugar, plus 1 tablespoon of cold water and a little seasoning to make the dressing. Peel, then halve the eggs., Peel and thinly slice the garlic, tear up the anchovies and trim and finely chop the chilli., Put 1 tablespoon of oil in the frying pan, place over a medium heat and fry the garlic for 30 seconds. Toss in the drained broccoli and cook for 2 minutes over a high heat, until starting to colour here and there., Spread the broccoli over a platter, then add the eggs, croutons and anchovies. Scatter with the chilli, drizzle over the dressing and serve."

Finely chop the chillies., Heat 2 tablespoons of peanut oil in a small saucepan, add the shallots and chilli and sauté over a low heat until very soft, about 10 minutes., Add the palm sugar and 20ml of water, increase the heat to high and bring it to the boil. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until caramelised.

Add the fish sauce and a the lime juice, then remove from the heat. Set aside until needed (you won’t need it all for this dish but the rest will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks)., Peel and finely slice the garlic, peel and finely grate the ginger, then halve the broccoli and Brussels lengthways., Heat 50ml of oil in a large frying pan or wok over a high heat, add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the broccoli and brussels sprouts and cook, stirring, for 8 minutes.

Stir in the fish sauce, put the lid on the pan and cook for 2 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender. Add the beansprouts and toss to combine. Divide between four serving plates., Wipe out the pan and return it to the heat, add a splash of oil and let it get nice and hot. In a bowl, whisk two eggs with a pinch of sea salt, pour them into the pan and swirl to coat it in a thin layer., Cook until the eggs are just set, then lay half of the salmon on top and roll up to enclose.

Boil hard for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Tip the contents of the pan into a blender and blitz until smooth. Rinse the pan, return to the heat and cook the rice according to the packet instructions., Steam the carrots in a colander above the rice for 20 minutes with a lid on, then remove them to a plate. Add the broccoli to the colander to steam for the last 5 minutes, then put aside and drain the rice., Meanwhile, season the pork all over with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, finely grate over a quarter of the nutmeg, then pick over the sage leaves and really press them into both sides of the pork., Put 1 tablespoon of oil into a large frying pan on a medium heat, then add the pork and steamed carrots. Cook the pork for 4 minutes on each side (depending on its thickness – use your instincts), or until golden and cooked through., Remove the pork to a board to rest for a few minutes. Reduce the heat to low, squeeze the orange juice over the carrots, shake the pan to coat them and pick up the sticky bits from the bottom, then leave until it becomes a natural syrupy glaze., Slice the pork and serve with the rice, broccoli and carrots. Swirl the yoghurt through half the apple sauce (keep the rest for another day) and serve on the side. Drizzle with any pan and resting juices, and tuck in."

tomato sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then fry in a good amount of olive oil until lightly coloured. Pick and tear the basil leaves, then add to the pan with the tomatoes. Using the back of a wooden spoon, mush and squash the tomatoes as much as you can. Season to taste., As soon as it comes to the boil, remove the pan from the heat. Strain the sauce through a coarse sieve into a bowl, using the spoon to push any larger bits of tomato through. Discard the basil and garlic left in the sieve, but scrape any tomatoey goodness off the back of the sieve into the bowl. Pour the sauce back into the pan, bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Cook until it’s the perfect consistency for spreading on your pizza bases., For the pizza dough, sieve the flour and salt onto a clean work surface and make a well in the middle. In a jug, mix the yeast, sugar and olive oil into 650ml lukewarm water and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well. Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. When it all starts to come together, work the rest of the flour in with your clean hands. Knead until you have a smooth, springy dough. Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for an hour until the dough has doubled in size., Remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out. You can use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in clingfilm, in the fridge (or freezer) until required. If using straight away, divide the dough up into 6 to 8 balls., Timing-wise, it’s a good idea to roll the pizza bases out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to cook them. Stack the pizza bases, with a square of oiled tin foil between each one, cover them with clingfilm, and pop them into the fridge. Now’s the time to get your wood-fired oven, or conventional oven, heated up to full whack. Place a couple of heavy baking trays in the oven to heat up, too., Meanwhile, click off the broccoli florets and roughly chop (using the stalk, too). Blanch in boiled salted water for 1 to 2 minutes, then drain. Tear the anchovies into small pieces, then deseed and finely chop the chilli. Squeeze the sausage meat out of their skins, then roll into small, rough meatballs., When you’re ready to assemble your pizzas, remove a tray from the oven, put a pizza base on it and assemble it quickly – smear tomato sauce on the base and dot with broccoli, torn up anchovy fillets and sausage meatballs. Tear over the Taleggio cheese and sprinkle with chilli. Crush and scatter over the fennel seeds. Place in the oven immediately while you prepare the remaining pizzas. If you’re using a wood-fired oven the pizzas should cook, one by one, in about 3 to 4 minutes – you want them to be puffed up, crispy and delicious. In a regular oven, they’ll take 8 to 10 minutes.

butter","Fry the bacon in a pan on a medium heat with a tiny drizzle of olive oil, until golden and crisp, then remove., For the butter, peel the garlic, then finely chop with the parsley leaves and mix into the softened butter with the cayenne. Firm up in the fridge., Working one-by-one on a board, stuff the chicken breasts. To do this, start by pulling back the loose fillet on the back of the breast – put your knife in the opposite direction and slice to create a long pocket (for extra guidance, watch the how-to video below)., Open the pocket up with your fingers, cut the chilled butter into four and push one piece into the pocket, then crumble in a rasher of crispy bacon. Fold and seal back the chicken, completely covering the butter and giving you a nice neat parcel. Repeat with the 3 remaining breasts., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Place the flour in one shallow bowl, whisk the eggs in another, and put the breadcrumbs and a pinch of seasoning into a third. Evenly coat each chicken breast in flour, then beaten egg, letting any excess drip off, and finally, turn them in the breadcrumbs, patting them on until evenly coated., Shallow-fry in 2cm of sunflower oil on a medium to high heat for a couple of minutes on each side, or until lightly golden, then transfer to a tray and bake in the oven for 10 minutes, or until cooked through. You can bake them completely in the oven and skip the frying altogether, you just need to drizzle them with olive oil and bake for about 20 minutes – they won’t be as golden, but they’ll be just as delicious., Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the potatoes and cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender., Chop up the broccoli and add it to the potatoes for the last 8 minutes. Drain and leave to steam dry, then return to the pan and mash with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper., Divide the mash between your plates and place a Kyiv on top of each portion. Lightly dress the spinach leaves or rocket in a little oil and lemon juice, then sprinkle over the top as a salady garnish. Serve with a wedge of lemon on the side."

It keeps in so many of the vitamins lost by boiling, and can be done in stacked steamer baskets. Best of all, though, it only takes up one ring of your cooker!, The butters are easy to make and can be done way ahead. Keep any leftovers in your freezer and use a slice when you cook a steak. Don’t cook all the vegetables or you’ll have far too many – just pick your two favourites., Make the flavoured butters. If you are making the turnips, pound the garlic, chilli and sun-dried tomatoes to a paste in a pestle and mortar. Add seasoning and the butter and pound well. Dollop onto a sheet of greaseproof paper and roll into a cylinder, twisting the ends like Christmas crackers. Place in the freezer to firm up., For the carrots, pound the sugar, zest, cumin seeds and thyme; for the broccoli, the rosemary and anchovies; for the mangetout, mix the lemon juice and zest. Then add the seasoning and butter, pound and roll into Christmas cracker shapes, as before., Put the veg in a 2-layer steamer. Carrots should be nearest to the heat, then baby turnips, then broccoli florets, then mangetout. Steam for 10 minutes and serve each vegetable with circles of flavoured butter melted over the top."

Pound the rosemary in a pestle and mortar until you have a paste. Add the anchovy fillets and pound again until the paste is dark green. Now add the lemon juice, a couple of lugs of olive oil and some pepper, and mix together until you have a sauce with a good drizzling consistency., Get a large, ovenproof, non-stick frying pan hot. Pat the salmon fillets with a little olive oil, season them with salt and pepper and cook them in the pan, skin-side down, for 2 minutes. Flip them over, then place the pan in the preheated oven for another 3 to 4 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets and the way they’ve been sliced., Just after the salmon goes into the oven, put your broccoli into some boiling, salted water for 3 to 4 minutes until perfectly cooked., To check if the fish is cooked all the way through, you can pull the fillets apart a little bit and look inside. Salmon goes from being an orangey colour to an opaque pink, so that’s what you’re looking for. Please do not overcook them, because, as simple as this dish sounds, it’s your mission to ‘just’ cook the fish so you’re rewarded with a soft inside and a slightly crispy outside – heaven!, When the broccoli’s perfectly done, drain it, toss it in a little of the anchovy-rosemary sauce and divide it between your plates. Place a salmon fillet on top of each and drizzle with some more sauce."

Basically, this is your opportunity to make the broccoli really delicate and more salady-looking, so spend a bit of time doing this. You’ll be left with the stalk, so discard the thick dry base, then cut the remaining stalk in half lengthways and finely slice., Blanch your broccoli florets and sliced stalks really quickly in boiling salted water for 60 seconds, just long enough to soften the broccoli but still leave it with a bit of a bite. Drain it in a colander, then spread it around a clean tea towel to steam dry (this is important because it will help the dressing cling to the broccoli). Once completely dry, transfer to a serving dish., Finely slice the bacon and fry on a medium heat with a small splash of olive oil until crisp and golden, then spoon most of the bacon bits over your broccoli., Any leftover fat in the pan can be used in your salad dressing. Pour it into a mixing bowl, then peel and finely grate in the garlic. Add all the other dressing ingredients, season with sea salt and black pepper, and whisk., Halve, deseed and finely slice the tomatoes and chop the chives, reserving the flowers. Add to your broccoli and bacon bits. Dress it all really well, and check the seasoning. If it needs pimping up, add a splash more vinegar. If you’ve got any chive flowers, sprinkle those over the top and serve straight away. It’s beautiful on its own or served next to any grilled or roasted meat or fish."
