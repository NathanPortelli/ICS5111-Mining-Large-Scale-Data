Mix with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil and a splash of water., Finely slice the chorizo, add to the pan for the last 2 minutes, then toss in the dressed tomatoes for 30 seconds., Divide between your plates, with the salmon on top. Spoon over the dressed olives and pick over the remaining basil."

Add the parsley stalks, shallot, garlic and chorizo to the heated oil and cook over a medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, or until the shallot is softened and the chorizo is beginning to crisp., In another pan, heat the stock with the tinned tomatoes. Add the rice to the shallot mixture and stir to coat the grains. Cook over a high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the grains have cracked and are slightly translucent at the tips, then pour in the red wine., Stir well and cook until almost all the wine has evaporated. Add the hot stock and tomato mixture, ladle by ladle, stirring well with each addition, and only adding more when the previous ladle is almost fully absorbed. You may not need all of the mixture, or you may need to top it up with a little water., The rice should be tender but with a little bite in the middle. When it’s cooked, add one last ladle of liquid., Finely grate the Parmesan, then add to the pan with some seasoning. Stir well, take off the heat and cover. Leave for 5 minutes or so before stirring again, tasting and adjusting the seasoning, if necessary., Serve topped with extra grated Parmesan and the chopped parsley leaves."

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for around 10 minutes, or until the peppers are soft and turning golden., Meanwhile, preheat the grill to medium-high., Squash the potatoes slightly and add to the pan. Turn the heat back up and fry for a few more minutes, stirring., Add the tomatoes and continue cooking for 5 minutes, or until the tomatoes have cooked down slightly., Make 4 wells in the pan, then carefully crack in the eggs. Cook for a couple of minutes, then pop the pan under the grill for 2 to 3 minutes, or until cooked to your liking – keep an eye on it., Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, sprinkle over the parsley leaves, then serve straight away."

After 15 minutes, they should be really easy to peel, so peel off and discard the skin., Peel and finely slice the onion and garlic, then roughly chop the tomatoes. Halve, deseed and finely slice the chilli, then pick and finely chop the oregano leaves., Heat a little olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and fry for a couple of minutes, then add the garlic, tomatoes, paprika, chilli and most of the oregano. Cook for around 5 minutes, or until starting to soften., Pull the chicken off the bones in chunky pieces, discarding the bones and skin. Add the chicken to the pan with the stock., Tear the peppers into chunky strips, add to the pan and stir well. Leave to bubble away for 25 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced and is thick and glossy., Place the fennel seeds into a pestle and mortar and bash until crushed., Place a second frying pan over a high heat. Slice open the skins of the chorizo sausages. Add a splash of olive oil to the pan and squeeze in the meat from the sausages, then add the crushed fennel seeds., Cook for about 5 minutes, or until dark golden, crisp and smelling fantastic, using a wooden spoon to break up the chorizo, stirring occasionally., Add a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and a generous pinch of sea salt and black pepper to the chicken., Take the pan straight to the table, dollop over the crème fraîche, drizzle with the balsamic and scatter with the crisp chorizo and reserved oregano. Delicious served with warm flatbreads or tortillas, or as a topping for jacket potatoes."

large pan with a splash of olive oil, then place on a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until browned., Peel the prawns, adding the heads and shells to the pan. Add the cayenne and stock, bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, thickly slice the chorizo. Peel the onion and celery, deseed the peppers, then roughly chop. Peel the garlic, then finely slice with the chillies. Scrub the sweet potatoes and chop into 3cm chunks., Place a large pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the chorizo, rosemary and thyme sprigs, and 2 bay leaves. Cook for 5 minutes, or until browned, then remove everything to a plate., Generously season the chicken with sea salt and black pepper, then place in the pan, skin side down. Turn the heat up to high and cook for 10 minutes, or until browned, turning occasionally. Remove to a plate., Add the chopped onion, celery, peppers, garlic and chillies to the pan with the cayenne and the remaining 2 bay leaves. Cook on a medium heat for 10 minutes, or until softened., Stir in the flour to coat, then sieve in 2 ladlefuls of the stock. Return the chicken and chorizo to the pan, along with the sweet potatoes and the tomatoes. Bring to the boil, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Cover and simmer for 40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender., Finely slice the Scotch bonnets (blanch them first in boiling water to reduce the heat, if you like). Bash the bay in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of salt, discarding the stalks. Muddle in a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and a splash of vinegar. Stir in the chopped chillies and set aside., Slice the okra and add to the gumbo pan for a further 10 minutes. Gently fold in the crabmeat and prawns for a final 5 minutes, or until cooked through. Season to perfection., Finely chop and scatter over the parsley, then serve with the pickled chillies. Good with brown rice and green salad."

Pour in 125ml of oil and about 200ml of warm water. Mix with a butter knife until it comes together as a dough, adding a splash more water, if needed., Tip the dough onto a floured work surface and knead for 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Pop it back into the bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to prove for 1 hour., Pour a lug of oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat. Peel and finely slice the garlic and onion, and add to the pan along with the cumin. Fry for 10 minutes, or until soft and sticky, stirring regularly., Drain the kidney beans and tip into the pan, then turn the heat up to medium. Add the soured cream and a splash of vinegar, season well with salt and black pepper and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the beans have warmed and softened., Roughly mash the beans or blitz in a blender to your desired texture. Return to the pan (if needed) and leave to one side for reheating later., Divide the dough into 12 even pieces and roll them into balls. Flatten each one with your hand, then roll out on a floured surface into a tortilla roughly 2mm thick and 18mm across., Place a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat to get nice and hot, then dry-fry each tortilla for 1 minute on each side, or until just coloured – you want to make sure they stay soft enough to roll. Keep warm under tin foil while you fry the rest and get your toppings ready., Prep and cook your chosen toppings, as needed – slice and fry the chorizo, coarsely grate the Cheddar, crumble the feta, slice the avocados and dress with lime juice, and fry the eggs to your liking., When you're ready to serve, lay out the toppings. Place the pan of beans over a medium heat for a couple of minutes, or until warmed through, then spread a couple of spoonfuls over each tortilla., Slice the chilli (deseed if you like) and finely chop the coriander. Serve the baleadas with lime wedges in the middle of the table to let everyone build their own. Delicious!"

The biggest one was for about 800 people in a village in Spain and it was hard work, but an incredible experience. The Spanish can be quite protective about what is and what isn’t a paella, but at the same time, the spirit of their cooking has always been flexible to whatever meat, fish, seafood or game can be found. I’ve eaten and enjoyed many paellas, and I hope you like my humble, great-value expression of one. ”",494,12g,3.3g,8.5g,1.6g,26.5g,75.7g,5.7g,"2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onion, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    carrot, ½ a                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh flat-leaf parsley                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), 70                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                quality chorizo, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    free-range chicken thighs                                                                                                                                                                , skin off, bone out, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                sweet smoked paprika, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red pepper, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                tomato purée, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    organic chicken stock cube, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                paella rice, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                frozen peas, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                frozen peeled cooked prawns                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon","Peel and finely slice the garlic, peel and roughly chop the onion and carrot. Finely chop the parsley stalks, then roughly chop the chorizo and chicken thighs., Put a lug of oil into a large lidded shallow casserole or paella pan on a medium heat, add the garlic, onion, carrot, parsley stalks, chorizo, chicken and paprika, and fry for around 5 minutes, stirring regularly., Deseed and chop the pepper, then add to the pan for a further 5 minutes., Stir through the tomato purée and crumble in the stock cube, then add the rice and stir for a couple of minutes so it starts to suck up all that lovely flavour., Pour in 750ml of boiling water and add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Pop the lid on and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 15 minutes, stirring regularly from the outside in and from the inside out, and adding a splash of water if needed., Stir in the peas and prawns, replace the lid, and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until hot through., Season to perfection, then chop the parsley leaves, scatter them over the paella, and serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over."

Fry everything together for a minute then add the sliced chorizo. Cook for another few minutes until the sausage starts to brown, then pour in the white wine, tinned tomatoes, rice and chickpeas. Season well and simmer for 10 minutes, until the rice is just about cooked., Meanwhile, put a frying pan on a medium heat to make the pangrattato. Add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and let it heat up for a minute or so, then add the breadcrumbs, flat-leaf parsley and lemon zest. Fry for a couple of minutes until it’s all golden brown and crispy then put to one side., After the soup has simmered for 10 minutes, it should have thickened a little, so stir in about 200ml of hot water and bring everything to the boil. Cut each of the fish fillets into three pieces, then, carefully, so you don’t get splashed by any of the hot liquid, place them and the prawns into the mixture. Cook for a further 5 minutes until the fish is cooked through and the prawns are pink., When the fish is perfectly cooked, stir through the basil leaves. Ladle the soup into warm bowls and top each with a nice big spoonful of pangrattato. Serve with a few wedges of lemon to squeeze over the finished dish and enjoy all those gorgeous flavours!"

Using a second knife, slice the squid across at 1cm intervals, as if you’re cutting to cut it into rings. You won’t be able to cut all the way because of the other knife., Light your barbecue or preheat a griddle pan to hot. Preheat your oven to full whack (240°C/475°F/gas 9)., Parboil the baby leeks for 3 minutes in a pan of boiling salted water, drain in a colander and let them steam dry. Dress them with some olive oil and a pinch of sea salt., Cook the leeks on the barbecue or in the griddle pan on both sides until nicely marked, then add the fennel wedges and chargrill these dry on both sides until they are also marked., Add the radicchio leaves and dry grill these on both sides to wilt them – 30 seconds on each side should do. Put the leeks fennel and radicchio into a large bowl - they might look a bit sad, but don’t worry because you’re going to pep them up!, For the chorizo dressing, heat a frying pan with a couple of lugs of olive oil. Fry the chorizo until the fat renders out, add the rosemary and garlic, toss and take off the heat after 30 seconds. Add the balsamic vinegar and half the lemon juice to the pan, mix and put to one side., Drizzle some olive oil over each squid, sprinkle with some salt and pepper and toss well. Preheat an ovenproof pan on the hob, pour in some olive oil and toss the reserved tentacles in the oil for 1 minute. Add all 4 squid and whack the pan in the preheated oven for a few minutes or until cooked and lightly browned., Pour the chorizo dressing over your chargrilled veggies and add a good squeeze of lemon juice. Take the squid out of the oven., Serve each of your guests a nice pile of the dressed veggies, a concertina squid, some tentacles and half a lemon. Sprinkle over some of the reserved herby fennel tops and tuck in!"

It’s Spanish because of the chorizo and potato, but a little Italian too because I like to finish it off in the oven instead of on the hob, so it puffs up like a soufflé. It has all the things I love in it – potatoes, sausage and eggs., Preheat your oven to full whack, or get your grill nice and hot. Put the potatoes into a saucepan of boiling salted water and simmer them until cooked, then drain in a colander and leave them to steam dry. Beat the eggs with a fork in a large mixing bowl, season well with salt and pepper, and put to one side., Heat a 20cm non-stick, ovenproof frying pan. Add the chorizo slices and the potato chunks. The chorizo will start to sizzle, releasing all its tasty oils and spices. After a couple of minutes, when everything’s lightly golden and crisp, remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and put to one side. Sprinkle the rosemary leaves into the hot fat. As soon as they hit the pan, they’ll start to crisp up. Pour the beaten eggs on top immediately, adding the potatoes and chorizo and spreading everything out evenly. Place the whole pan in the preheated oven or under the grill until the omelette is golden brown on top and just cooked through in the middle., While the omelette is cooking, put the shallots into a bowl with the lemon juice, some salt and pepper and a lug of extra virgin olive oil. Toss and pinch the shallots with your fingertips to soften them slightly, then mix in the parsley leaves. Serve a little on top of the omelette and tuck in!"

wedges","Heat a large wide-based pan over a medium heat and add a lug of olive oil, the sliced chorizo and the pork belly. Fry for around 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. As soon as the chorizo starts taking on colour and the fat is beginning to cook out of it, add the chopped peppers, garlic, onion and parsley stalks along with a good pinch of salt and pepper and the saffron. Fry gently for another 10 minutes, or until the vegetables have begun to soften. Meanwhile pick through the shellfish and get rid of any clams or mussels that aren't tightly closed., Add the rice and jarred peppers and keep stirring for a few minutes until the rice is coated in all the lovely flavours, then pour in the tinned tomatoes and 800ml of stock, seasoning again with salt and pepper. Bring everything to the boil, then turn down to a medium to low heat and stir constantly for about 15 minutes. This combination of flavours will be absolutely beautiful, but you’ve got to help the dish along by doing your job and making sure each grain of rice gets the same amount of love. So every now and then, stir from the outside of the pan into the middle so you get a sort of pile of rice in the centre, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom. Flatten the pile out with your spoon, then start the whole process again., After 15 minutes the rice should be cooked, but still have a bit of a bite, so add the mussels or clams and the prawns. You may want to add an extra splash of stock here if the rice looks a bit dry. Keep stirring, and as the clams and mussels start to open and the prawns begin to turn pink, add your squid and green beans and cook for a further 5 minutes or so. Discard any clams or mussels that don't open. Stir in the chopped parsley leaves and the juice from half your lemon wedges, and bring to the table with the remaining lemon wedges on the side and a crisp green salad."

Drain and leave to steam dry., Cut the chorizo into 2cm chunks and place in a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan. Cook in the hot oven for a couple of minutes to render out the fat and give it a bit of colour. Carefully pull out the pan, give it a jiggle and add the sliced pepper. Return to the oven for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the pepper starts to soften. Add the potatoes and tomatoes to the pan and give it a good shake so that everything gets coated in all the lovely chorizo oil. Return to the oven for 2 to 3 minutes, or until everything is cooked through and nicely coloured., Remove the pan from the oven and use the back of a spoon to make four wells in the mixture. Crack your eggs, one by one, into the wells. Season with salt and pepper, then return the pan to the oven for about 2 minutes (depending on how you like your eggs). Keep a close eye on the pan and pull it out as soon as the eggs are done to your liking. Scatter with chopped parsley, then take the pan to the table for everyone to tuck in. Serve with hunks of crusty bread."
