Susan's seafood gumbo | Jamie Oliver recipes,"King prawns, langoustines, sea bass & cockles","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/118227284.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '8']",30 minutes,"“Inspired by the one and only legendary US chef Leah Chase, this spicy New Orleans classic is the ultimate surf & turf. A dark roux is key here, plus the ‘holy trinity’ base of onions, peppers and celery. Feel free to substitute the prawns with crayfish, and use any other type of cured sausage you like. It’s seriously good – pure comfort in a bowl.  ”",583,36g,13g,6.2g,2.8g,45.9g,19.7g,3.1g,"1.5

Peel the prawns (keeping the tails on), throwing the heads and shells into the stock pan as you go. Run the tip of a knife down the backs of the prawns and pull out and discard the dark veins, then score a little deeper so they butterfly as they cook., Slice the sausage into rough chunks, place in a large casserole pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then cook for 10 minutes, or until it has released its tasty fat., Turn down the heat to low, then remove the sausage to a plate, leaving the fat behind in the pan. Stir the butter and flour into the pan, really scraping up all the sticky bits from the bottom. Continue stirring for 15 to 20 minutes (be patient!), or until dark golden brown – think peanut butter, but you can take it even darker, if you prefer (see tip). You want the roux to have a semi-loose, doughy consistency, so add a splash of oil if there isn’t a lot of fat., Deseed the peppers, peel the onion and roughly chop with the celery, then stir into the roux pan (this is called the holy trinity). Scrunch and add the bay leaves and strip in the thyme leaves, then peel, finely chop and add the garlic, followed by the cayenne and Tabasco., Put the sausage back into the pan, then scrunch in the tomatoes using clean hands, stirring as you go. Ladle the stock through a sieve into the pan, then let it blip away for 10 minutes., Trim the green beans, slice each into three pieces, then add to the pan and cook for 6 minutes. Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley., Slice the sea bass fillets lengthways into thin strips, then halve the langoustines and crack the claws (if using). Sort through the cockles or clams and tap them – if any stay open, throw them away., Add all the fish and seafood to the pan and simmer for a few minutes, or until perfectly cooked – the prawns should be pink and the clams or cockles open (discard any that remain closed), stirring regularly., Squeeze over lemon juice to taste, and scatter with the chopped parsley.

surface and remove the tough outer layer. Peel the shallot and ginger, deseed the chillies, then roughly chop everything with the lemongrass. Add to a large pestle and mortar with a good pinch of sea salt and the lime leaves (discard the stalks) and pound to a paste., Toast the peanuts in a large frying pan over a medium heat for 3 minutes, or until golden, then bash half into the paste. Add the tomato purée and fish sauce, finely grate in the lime zest and squeeze in all the juice, then muddle together., With a sharp knife, score the sea bass skin at 1cm intervals in a criss-cross fashion, then rub all over with the paste, both inside and out., Get your banana leaf (if using), or tear off a piece of baking paper five times as long as the fish and fold it in half to give you double thickness. Place the fish in the middle, then fold over to seal the fish snuggly inside. Place on a large baking tray and roast for 25 minutes, or until the flesh is succulent and comes away easily from the bone., To make the rice, drizzle the vegetable oil into a saucepan over a medium heat. Crumble in the creamed coconut, then squeeze in the lime juice, throwing in the squeezed lime halves. Tip in the rice and fry for 2 minutes, then pour over 1 mug of boiling water and turn down the heat to low. Cover and cook for 12 minutes, then remove from the heat and allow to steam for a further 3 minutes., For the chilli pickle, finely slice the chillies and place in a small bowl with the sugar, vinegar and a pinch of salt, then mix together and leave aside., Now make the salad. Crack open the coconut and finely grate 50g of flesh into a serving bowl. Halve the sugar snaps and mangetout, finely shred both cabbages and cucumber, then peel and finely slice the mango and add it all to the bowl. Pick in most of the herb leaves, squeeze over the lime juice and toss together., Pop the fish on a serving platter. Roughly crush the remaining peanuts in a pestle and mortar, then scatter over the salad and the fish. Drizzle the fish with the soy sauce and scatter over the remaining salad herbs., Take the fish, chilli pickle, rice and salad to the table and let everyone help themselves."

Combine the prawns, tarragon and olive oil in a small bowl and season generously. For the egg wash, whisk the egg and milk in a small bowl and set aside., Lightly flour a work surface and roll out half of the pastry to a rectangular shape about 5mm thick and 10cm longer than the fish fillets (for the head and tail). Transfer to a lightly oiled baking tin., Place one of the fillets, skin-side down, on the pastry, leaving a little more space at one end for the tail shape. Spoon the prawn and tarragon mixture over the fish and place the other fillet on top. Brush the edges of the pastry with the egg wash., Roll out the remaining pastry to the same size and use this to cover the fish, pressing the edges carefully to seal them. Use a small, sharp knife to trim the excess and create your fish shape. Then, with a teaspoon, score half-moon shapes into the pastry in the style of fish scales (but don’t pierce the pastry)., Roll the off-cut pastry to 1cm thick, cut out a few thin strips to shape into fins, and tear off a small piece and roll into a ball for the fish’s eye. Build your fish shape, brush with the remaining egg wash, then bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 220ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and cook for another 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the fish is cooked., Meanwhile, make the salsa verde.

Pick the herbs and cress, and place in the fridge., You can assemble the ceviche just before your guests are ready to eat, but it’s important that you don’t leave the fish marinating for too long – you don’t want the acids in the juices to cook the fish. Pour the lemon dressing over the fish mixture and immediately mix it up. Leave it to sit for about 2½ minutes while you lay out the plates., Throw most of the herb mixture into the bowl with the fish and very quickly toss it together – no more than 10 seconds., Divide the ceviche between 4 plates, gently spoon over a little of the dressing (discarding the rest) and sprinkle with the remaining herbs., Drizzle over a little oil from a height, sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper, and enjoy."

The way I heard it, this brilliant rub was invented by an African-American chef working at Commander’s Palace, a posh New Orleans restaurant. The famous head chef there, Paul Prudhomme, took this recipe, added his own little tweaks and introduced blackened fish to the rest of the world. Basically it’s a bold rub that fragrantly flavours fish and meat and goes dark when it cooks, thanks to the paprika and garlic., Traditionally this dish has been made with the locally caught redfish, but it’s also great with any whole or filleted white fish. It goes with so many things, including chicken, pork, lamb and steak. When I was in Louisiana I cooked it on a barbecue, but I’ve shown you below how to do it indoors in a pan. Don’t be scared by how black the spices go: they’ll look burnt but the taste will be amazing., To make the rub, bash up your fresh herbs and garlic in a pestle and mortar until you've got a nice coarse paste. Mix in the spices, 1 teaspoon of sea salt, 1 level tablespoon of black pepper and the olive oil, then squeeze in the juice of half the lemon, making sure not to let any pips get in there, and stir well., Lightly score the skin of your fish in lines about 2cm apart. Using your fingers, smear the rub all over both sides of the fish and into the cuts you've made. Put a non-stick pan or griddle pan over a medium-high heat and let it get nice and hot. Place your fish in the pan, skin side down, and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes. It will get quite smoky, so you might want to open a window! Turn the heat down to low, then, very carefully, flip your fish over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side., Cut your remaining lemon half and your second lemon into wedges for squeezing over. Serve them with your fish, a nice salad and boiled or steamed new potatoes dressed in good olive oil or butter. Don’t forget a nice cold glass of wine!"

Finely slice the whole fennel, peel and finely slice the garlic and lightly crush the fennel seeds. Place a medium pan over a medium heat and add the olive oil and half the butter. Once hot, add the fennel and fennel seeds and fry gently for around 5 minutes. Add the garlic and continue cooking for around 5 minutes, or until the fennel is soft, golden brown and sweet. Set aside to cool., Meanwhile, place a medium pan over a high heat and cook the potatoes for around 5 minutes, or until parboiled. Drain and set aside. Finely chop all the herbs together and add to a bowl along with remaining butter, then mix well until combined and set aside. Ensure the sea bass is clean inside and out, pat dry with kitchen paper and make 3 diagonal cuts into one side of the fish down to the bone. Stuff the cuts with the herb butter and fill the cavity of each fish with 2 slices of lemon and the cooked fennel., Gently transfer the fish to the inside of the foil bag or onto the foil. Add in the whole potatoes, capers, tomato sauce and white wine. Seal the foil bag at the end or, if you're using foil, fold it up like a parcel., Place the foil bags onto a baking tray and pop into the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through. Remove from the oven and allow to sit for 2-3 minutes, then place onto a serving plate, carefully open and enjoy with a crisp green salad or steamed vegetables."

In a food processor or liquidizer, whiz up the coriander stalks, half of the coriander leaves, the ginger, garlic, halved chillies, sesame oil, soy sauce, lime juice and zest and the coconut milk. This will give you a lovely fragrant Thai-style paste., Cook your rice in salted, boiling water until it’s just undercooked, then drain it in a colander. Scoop it into a high-sided roasting tray. Pour your Thai paste over the rice and mix it in well, then shake it out flat. Lay the sea bass fillets on top, scatter over the sugar snap peas or mangetouts, then cover the dish tightly with tinfoil and put it in the preheated oven for around 15 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle over the spring onions, the sliced chilli and the other half of the coriander leaves. Divide between your plates with a wedge of lime."

on the middle shelf., Tear off a metre of kitchen foil. Fold it in half so it’s double thickness, then fold it in half again. You should end up with what looks like a big, foil birthday card. Make two of these then lay them opened and flat on your table. Each foil wrap will hold one piece of fish – you can do a big one for four or a slightly smaller version for two., In a pestle and mortar, bash your lime leaves until they break down and all the flavour comes out. Then add the lemon grass and do the same again. Do this for a couple of minutes... it’s worth every second. Then add the garlic, chilli, grated ginger and all of the coriander stalks. Once this is all smashed to a pulp, add the soy sauce, the lime zest and juice and the olive old. Mix well, then taste and correct the seasoning with extra soy sauce as you see fit., Lightly score the sea bass on the skin side with a sharp knife and then rub them with the lime-ginger-lemon grass mix. Allow to marinate for an hour, if you have time, or you can cook it all straight away., Lightly brush the foil edges with a little beaten egg white – this helps to seal the parcel when you fold it up and keeps all the flavoured steam inside to cook the fish., Put the portions of sea bass, skin-side up on one side of each envelope. Divide the marinade and all the juice between the two packages and tuck some coriander into the slits of each piece of fish. Fold over the foil, then fold up two sides of the envelopes securely. Just before you seal the final side of the foil bags, divide the sake between the two envelopes, taking care so that it doesn’t dribble out. Pucker and bend the folded sides up so that the juices can’t cook out. Don’t fold the foil right up to the edge of the fish – leave about 2 inches (5 cm) of space all round the fillets to let the steam circulate., I know all this sounds like a bit of a palaver, but it’s actually dead simple., Place straight on to the hot tray and cook for about 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Once cooked, allow to sit for 2–3 minutes. Serve the bags at the table – just cut them open and carefully lift out the fish. You can spoon the juices over it (but don’t eat the bits from the marinade as they’re really only there for flavour)., I like to serve this with a bowl of coriander-flavoured rice or noodles, cooked simply. You’re going to love it."

Score the skin of your fish fillets all over, about 1cm deep, and season., Put the fish fillets into the pan, skin side down, with the squid tentacles. Add the scallops. Run your knife down one side of each squid to open them out, then quickly and lightly score the inside in a criss-cross fashion. Lay them in the pan, scored side down., Add the asparagus and gently shake the pan. Cook for a few minutes, then turn everything over and cook on the other side. Sprinkle over the thyme tips., You’re the one in control of the pan, so if something looks cooked, take it out and keep it warm. Don’t watch things burn! When the fish has crispy skin, the scallops are golden brown with caramelized edges and the squid has curled up and is nicely chargrilled, remove the pan from the heat., Put the squid on a chopping board and roughly slice it into pieces at an angle, then return to the pan. Lay the fish fillets on each plate. Toss the asparagus, scallops and squid with half the chilli, a good drizzle of good-quality extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice. Lightly season and mix together., Divide on top of the plated fish. Sprinkle with the rest of the chopped chilli and the fennel tops, and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil."
