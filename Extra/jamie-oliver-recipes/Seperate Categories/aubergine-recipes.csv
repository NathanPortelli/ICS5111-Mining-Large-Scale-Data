The trick is to grill the aubergine without any oil for a really intense, smoky, charred flavour. Coated in a sweet, sticky maple-sriracha glaze, it’s lip-smackingly good. With a zesty peanut butter dressing, fresh herbs, crunchy peanuts, spring onions and chilli, this has so much going on!

Slice the aubergines in half lengthways and use a knife to cross hatch the flesh. Grill in a roasting tin for 10 minutes or until charred. Once the aubergine is grilled, remove from the oven and turn the oven to 220˚C/200˚C fan/gas 7., Meanwhile, whisk together the soy, maple syrup, siracha and sesame oil. Place the charred aubergine on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment and drizzle with the marinade. Cover with foil and roast for 20 minutes. Remove the foil cover and spoon any glaze in the tray over the aubergine, then roast for a further 8–10 minutes, uncovered, until very soft and sticky., Whisk the ingredients for the sweet and spicy peanut sauce with enough water to make it drizzleable consistency., Once the aubergines are cooked, place on a large platter and drizzle with the sauce.

Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon of dried oregano and toss together to coat the slices evenly., Heat a deep 24cm ovenproof frying pan and fry the aubergine for approximately 3 minutes on each side, or until they develop a bit of colour. Set the aubergine aside, and don’t wash the mixing bowl as you will use this later., Very finely slice the onions and fry in a little oil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they colour. Remove from the pan., Using the same ovenproof pan, spread one third of the aubergine on the base (be careful – it will be hot), followed by one third of the onions, then spoon over one third of the passata. Season with salt, pepper, the remaining dried oregano and scatter over a handful of grated Cheddar, then repeat with two more layers, finishing the final layer with extra cheese., Cook in the oven at 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden., Break the lettuce leaves into the reserved mixing bowl (it should still have a coating of olive oil and seasoning from the aubergines). Toss to lightly season the leaves and serve with the parmigiana."
Aubergine & courgette lasagne | Jamie Oliver Cookbook Club recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/140239904.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '6']",,"“My mother used to make the most delicious lasagne – I used to get so excited when I knew it was coming. She was brilliant at making the béchamel sauce – it was always perfectly creamy but never thick and floury. The trick to this was to cook it very slowly and use equal quantities of flour and butter. This is a vegetable lasagne, but it has as much flavour as the traditional meaty offering because you roast the aubergines first. Try to use egg-based lasagne sheets as they tend to have more flavour and are not as brittle when you cook them (or, better still, make your own sheets of pasta). ”",,,,,,,,,"4

200°C/180°C fan/400°F/Gas 6. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions, courgettes and a good seasoning of salt. Cook for 20 minutes, until the onion and courgettes are soft., Heat another tablespoon of the olive oil in a separate saucepan, then add the garlic. Fry the garlic for 30 seconds, then add the passata and cook the mixture gently for 20 minutes, until reduced by half. Season with salt and pepper, then stir through the basil., Brush both sides of the aubergine slices with olive oil and season them with salt. Place the aubergines in an even layer on a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Bake them for 15 minutes, then turn them over and bake them for a further 15 minutes. Remove the slices from the oven and, when they are cool enough to handle, cut them into halfmoons. Set them aside and leave the oven on., To make the béchamel, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a low heat. When the butter has melted, add the flour and cook it out for a couple of minutes, stirring to combine. Next, add the hot milk and stir continuously to avoid any lumps forming. Cook the sauce gently for 20 minutes, stirring all the while, until smooth and thickened, then mix in the Parmesan and check the seasoning. Leave to one side., Mix the aubergines, courgettes, onions and tomato sauce together in a large bowl and check that everything is seasoned well., Use the remaining olive oil to oil a baking dish, then place a layer of lasagne sheets in the base of the dish. Add one-third of the vegetable mixture in an even layer, then top this with one-quarter of the béchamel sauce. Repeat this twice more, then finish with a layer of lasagne sheets and a final layer of béchamel sauce. Sprinkle the top with some more Parmesan, then bake the lasagne for 35 minutes, until the pasta is cooked and the top is golden. Serve with a little extra grated Parmesan on top, if you like."

Remove to a board., Halve the chilli lengthways and deseed, peel and finely slice the garlic, then peel and finely chop the onion. Crush the cardamom pods in a pestle and mortar and remove the outer shells, then pound up the seeds., Place a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the cumin, mustard and cardamom seeds. Strip in the rosemary and let it gently sizzle for a few minutes, infusing the oil and allowing the flavours to mingle. Add the chilli, garlic and onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly., Chop the aubergine into 3cm chunks and stir into the pan, then add 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar. Let it sizzle for a couple of minutes, then pour in the beans, juice and all, the lentils and 600ml of water. Set fire to the cinnamon stick, then sit it in the centre of the pan. Cover the daal and leave to thicken on a medium-low heat for 1 hour, loosening with splashes of water, if needed, and stirring occasionally. Season to perfection, tasting and tweaking."
Whole burnt aubergine | Jamie Oliver recipes,"With charred egg yolk, tahini and chilli sauce","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/126135112.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['a', 'meal']",,"“This is the essence of our food, distilled into a single dish. It is inspired by the first whole burnt aubergine we ever ate, served with a smattering of grated tomato, at a very famous Jerusalem establishment we both love. It has since become a staple at every BBQ, and in our restaurant Honey & Smoke. Burning the aubergine really brings out the best in this slightly bland vegetable. Don’t hold back – by the time you’re done, the skin should be blackened and the flesh so soft it can easily be scooped out with a spoon.  ”",,,,,,,,,"2

                , leaves picked and chopped (about 30 g / 1 oz)","Place the whole aubergines on a very hot grill, or directly on the embers if you prefer. Let them scorch all over, turning occasionally, until the skin is charred and the flesh is so soft that it seems they are going to collapse., While the aubergines are cooking, combine all the dressing ingredients apart from the chopped parsley. Separately mix the tahini paste with the water to form a thick whipped cream consistency., Once the aubergines are fully blackened, remove from the grill onto serving plates and slit open to reveal the flesh., Add the parsley to the dressing and mix well. Use half the dressing to douse the flesh of the slit aubergines, then top with the whipped tahini. Use the back of a spoon to create a little well in the tahini and place a raw egg yolk in the centre of each one.

Sprinkle the slices with sea salt, and spend a couple of minutes gently bashing and tenderizing them with a meat mallet or rolling pin. Take a piece of kitchen paper and dab off the liquid from both sides of the aubergine., Beat the eggs in a shallow bowl. Blitz the focaccia into fine crumbs in a food processor and pour on to a plate. Dip the aubergine slices in the egg, let any excess drip off, then dip each side in the crumbs., Fry in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil for 6 minutes, or until golden, turning halfway. Transfer to an oiled baking tray, finely grate over most of the Parmesan and pop into the oven., Cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions., Wipe out the frying pan, returning it to a medium-high heat with ½ a tablespoon of oil. Peel, finely slice and add the garlic. Fry until lightly golden, pour in the tomatoes, then swirl a splash of water around the tomato tin and into the pan., Pick the baby basil leaves and put aside, tear the rest into the sauce, season to perfection, then leave to simmer on a low heat., Once cooked, use tongs to drag the spaghetti straight into the sauce, letting a little starchy cooking water go with it. Toss together, then divide between plates. Sit the aubergine on top, grate over the remaining Parmesan and finish with the baby basil leaves."

It’s cheesy, oozy and mega delicious, plus it’s really fun to make. First I steam the aubergine, to make it soft, silky and a total pleasure to eat, then I crisp it up with garlic, chilli, sage and lemon for added flavour, before turning it into the most scrumptious sauce.

Peel, quarter and add the onions, then cover with a lid and cook for 20 minutes., Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic, and pick the sage leaves., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Remove the lid, and once most of the liquid has cooked away, make a well in the middle. Add 3 tablespoons of oil, the garlic, chilli flakes and most of the sage leaves, then finely grate in the lemon zest. Once golden, scrunch in the tomatoes, pour in 2 tins' worth of water, and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally., Remove the pan from the heat, grate in the cheeses, then season to absolute perfection with sea salt and black pepper., Tear in the pasta sheets and mix up really well to coat and separate, then pull some of the sheets to the top to create a top layer., Bash the almonds until fine and rub the remaining sage leaves with oil, then sprinkle on top., Use the back of a spoon to create some dips and wells, and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. I love this served with a big crunchy green salad dressed with balsamic vinegar."

paste and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly., Stir in the peanut butter, mango chutney and tamarind paste, season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then scrape into a bowl, adding a splash of water to loosen to a paste, if needed., Leaving them intact at the stalk, prick the whole aubergines all over with a fork, cut into quarters lengthways, rub and stuff them generously with all the paste, then arrange them in the tray (if using regular aubergines, simply trim then cut into 1cm-thick rounds and sandwich the paste between them)., Place the tray on a medium heat and fry for 5 minutes, turning halfway., Add the coconut milk, roughly chop and sprinkle over the tomatoes, season well with salt and pepper, and bring to the boil., Cover with tin foil and roast for 40 minutes, or until thickened and reduced, removing the foil halfway. Season to perfection and scatter over the coriander leaves. Always good with fluffy rice, poppadoms, yoghurt and extra fresh chilli."
Vegetarian rogan josh recipe | Jamie Oliver curry recipes,With pistachio crumb topping,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/82935630.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",In45 minutes,"“Just a handful of ingredients is all it takes to rustle up the most beautiful vegetable curry. All you need is a good, firm aubergine, super-ripe tomatoes, crunchy pistachios, curry paste and some fresh coriander. It’s delicious on its own with rice or poppadoms, but I also love to serve it with a bit of roast chicken or fish. Happy days – what a dish! ”",150,7.4g,1g,14.5g,1.1g,5.4g,15.9g,4.6g,"1                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                 aubergine                                                                                                                                                                , (300g), 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon                                                                                                                                                                , optional, 2                                                                                                                                                                big handfuls                                                                                                                                                                of mixed ripe tomatoes                                                                                                                                                                , (600g), 1                                                                                                                                                                handful of                                                                                                                                                                shelled pistachios                                                                                                                                                                , (30g), 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh coriander                                                                                                                                                                 , (30g), olive oil, 2                                                                                                                                                                heaped teaspoons                                                                                                                                                                Patak’s rogan josh spice paste","Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Cut off and discard the aubergine stalk, then slice lengthways in half. Score a criss-cross pattern in the flesh of each half with a sharp knife. Halve the lemon (if using) and rub it over the aubergine flesh – this will stop it discolouring., Pour ½ a wine glass of water into a lidded pan on a medium-low heat. Put the aubergine into the pan, , skin-side down, and pop the lid on. Leave to steam for about 8 minutes, or until the pan is almost dry and the aubergine is starting to open up., Chop your tomatoes, halving or quartering the larger ones and leaving any small ones whole., Pound the pistachios to a crumb in a pestle and mortar, leaving a few bigger chunks for texture. Chop the coriander stalks, reserving the leaves for later., When the aubergine water has almost disappeared, add a little oil to the pan and push the aubergines flat with a spatula to crisp up the skin., Add the spice paste to one side of the pan, fry it off a little, then add the coriander stalks and tomatoes, gently turning to coat in the paste. Turn the aubergine halves over and give the pan a little shake. Scatter over the pistachios, then transfer to the oven, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until bubbling and golden. Serve scattered with the reserved coriander leaves."

Put aside., Drizzle all the chicken pieces with oil, place in a large shallow pan on a medium-high heat, skin side down, to get golden on all sides, then remove to a large platter., Wipe the salt off the aubergines and add to the pan, turning until lightly golden on all sides. Remove the aubergines to the platter and reduce the heat under the pan to low., Peel and slice the garlic, prick the chillies and place both in the pan with the cinnamon, woody herbs and capers., Stir and fry for a couple of minutes while you peel and finely slice the onions, then stir them into the pan, too. Cook for 15 minutes, or until starting to caramelize, stirring occasionally., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Squeeze the tomatoes in a bowl of water to remove the seeds – a fine nonna trick to prevent you getting splattered – then tear them into the pan., Put the chicken and aubergines back in, drizzle over any resting juices, then pour in 600ml of water., Sprinkle over the pine nuts, then squeeze over the lemon juice. Cook at the bottom of the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden., Pick over the basil leaves and serve with a nice big bowl of lemony couscous."

ginger, deseed the chillies, then slice it all with the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves). Place it all in a large ovenproof pan on a medium heat and char for 1 to 2 minutes to soften slightly., Tip into a large pestle and mortar, add the remaining paste ingredients and bash to a thick paste (or whiz in a food processor)., Return the pan to a medium heat. Halve the chicken legs through the bone, then place skin side down in the pan with the quail. Cut off and add the partridge and pheasant legs. Remove and discard the partridge and pheasant backbones, then halve the birds and add to the pan., Dry-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until everything is golden all over, then add the curry leaves and 1 heaped tablespoon of the paste. Leave to tick away on a low heat while you prep the aubergines, stirring regularly., Leaving the finger and round aubergines intact at the stalk, cut into quarters lengthways. Cut the large aubergine into thick rounds and slice down into the outer edge of each round to make a pocket. Use the remaining paste to stuff all the aubergines and coat their outsides., Layer into the pan on top of the game – it’ll be snug! Transfer to the oven to cook for 40 minutes, or until the aubergines are tender and the meat is cooked through., Put the pan back on a medium heat on the hob, then pour in the coconut milk and a splash of water. Let it gently bubble away for 2 minutes, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper and sprinkle over the coriander leaves. Delicious served with pickles, salad, rice and Fluffy coconut breads."

Now, the base of any good curry is the paste, so it’s worth the effort to hunt out all the ingredients. Just remember, a little goes a long way, so make a big batch and freeze it in portions for future use. ”",228,15.9g,8.1g,3.8g,0.4g,16.6g,4.9g,3.4g,"2

Pound to a powder in a pestle and mortar, then tip into a bowl., Trim the chillies (deseed if you like) and roughly chop with the lemongrass (use just the thick, lower part, discarding the outer layer), then peel and chop the galangal, garlic and shallots., Place it all in a pestle and mortar with 2 sprigs of coriander (stalks and all) and a good pinch of sea salt. Finely grate in the kaffir lime zest, then pound to a paste. Muddle in the shrimp paste, ground cumin and coriander, and white pepper (or whiz everything together in a food processor)., Deseed the red chillies, finely slice at an angle and place in ice-cold water, ready for serving. Slice the chicken into 2cm strips., Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a large heavy-bottomed pan on a medium-high heat. Add 3 heaped tablespoons of the curry paste (save the rest for another day) and a splash of coconut milk, then fry for 30 seconds, or until smelling fantastic, stirring continuously., Stir in the chicken, then, after 5 minutes, pour in the remaining coconut milk and bring to the boil, stirring regularly. Tear in the kaffir lime leaves and simmer for 10 minutes., Stir the palm sugar into the pan and have a taste; the curry should be slightly sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Add the fish sauce and taste again – it should taste well rounded, salty with an underlying sweetness., Quarter the aubergines and add to the pan to cook for 2 to 3 minutes (regular aubergines will take quite a bit longer, so cook until tender), then turn off the heat., Pick and stir in most of the Thai basil, then drain the chilli and sprinkle over with the remaining Thai basil and coriander. Delicious served with jasmine rice."

Aubergine parmigiana | Aubergine recipes | Jamie Oliver recipe,"Fried aubergines, oozy mozzarella & sweet tomato sauce","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/58419465.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In30 minutes,"“Claudio first had this Italian classic when he was on his honeymoon in Capri. Aubergine parmigiana is typically a homely al forno dish, rustically thrown together and baked, much like a lasagne. However, Oliver Glowig, the chef who was behind this wonderful take on parmigiana, has made a few tweaks to really kick it up a notch: the aubergine and cheeses are layered up in uniform stacks, and then the aubergine skin is finely sliced and fried off for a final flourish. It looks very special indeed.  ”",464,35.7g,11.9g,5.5g,1.8g,21g,16.9g,1.2g,"1                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                 aubergine                                                                                                                                                                , (400g), 2                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                free-range eggs, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                plain flour, olive oil, 150                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                scamorza                                                                                                                                                                , (smoked mozzarella), 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                buffalo mozzarella, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                dried oregano, 40                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Parmesan cheese, extra virgin olive oil, TOMATO SAUCE, 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil                                                                                                                                                                , (30g), 1 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                quality plum tomatoes","Peel the aubergine using a speed-peeler, then very finely slice the skin into matchsticks and reserve for later., Slice the aubergine into ½cm-thick rounds – if you want to be really precise, use a circular cutter (roughly 7cm in diameter) to trim the slices into perfect discs – then season with sea salt., Whisk the eggs in a shallow bowl with a small pinch of salt and black pepper, and put the flour into another shallow bowl., Pour ½cm of olive oil into a large frying pan and heat gently over a medium heat., Working in batches, coat in the aubergine discs in flour, shaking off any excess, then gently drop into the beaten egg, letting any excess drip off, and carefully place into the hot oil., Fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp, then remove to kitchen paper to drain, and repeat with the remaining discs., For the tomato sauce, drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a pan over a medium heat. Peel and finely slice the garlic, along with the basil stalks and fry for 2 minutes, or until lightly golden., Scrunch the tomatoes into the pan through your clean hands, then season to perfection with a pinch of salt and pepper., Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until thickened and reduced. Finely slice half the basil leaves and stir them through the sauce a few minutes before the end, then remove from the heat and season to taste., When the aubergine discs are all fried, turn the heat up to high and fry the aubergine skin for 1 to 2 minutes, or until super-crisp, then drain on kitchen paper., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., To assemble, get yourself 4 small ovenproof dishes. Peel, then slice the scamorza into ½cm-thick slices. Add a spoonful of sauce to the bottom of each dish, place a slice of aubergine on top, followed by spoon of tomato sauce, a slice of scamorza and a little buffalo mozzarella. Sprinkle with a little oregano, and tear over a few basil leaves. Repeat the layers twice more, finishing with a layer of aubergine and a good grating of Parmesan., Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and is golden and bubbling. Serve the Parmigiana with the crispy aubergine skin sprinkled over the top and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

Set aside to allow the excess water to drain out., Rinse the rice well, until the water runs almost clear. Drain and place in a small saucepan along with 375ml of water., Pop a glass lid on, bring to the boil, then cook over a low heat for 25 minutes, or until you can see holes in the surface of the rice (don’t be tempted to lift the lid). Take off the heat and leave, covered, for 20 minutes., Fold 4 tablespoons of rice vinegar, the tablespoons of sugar and 1 pinch of salt into the rice., Set the grill to high. Quarter the aubergine lengthways and score the flesh. Place flesh-side up on a foil-lined baking tray and grill for 15 minutes, or until almost tender., Mix the miso and mirin with the remaining tablespoon of rice vinegar and 1 tablespoon of water.

Meanwhile, pop the turkey, curry paste and yoghurt in a large mixing bowl, and toss to completely coat the meat., Next make your charred aubergine. Turn your gas hob on to high, then prick both the aubergines with a fork all over. Sit them directly on the flame., Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, turning every now and then. You want to get that nice charred flavour. (If you don’t have a gas hob, pop them under a hot grill for 5 to 10 minutes, turning every now and then.), Once charred all over, leave to cool for 5 minutes in a bowl covered with clingfilm., Once the aubergine has cooled, peel off the skin and mash up the flesh, chopping through it with a knife to turn it into a chunky dip., Pick the mint leaves, then finely chop. Peel and finely grate the garlic, then deseed and finely chop the chilli. Put it all into a small bowl, reserving half the chilli and chopped mint, along with 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil., Mix well, then stir half of this dressing into the mashed aubergine along with sea salt and black pepper, to taste. Set aside. Peel and cut the onion into wedges., Once the griddle is hot, spoon in the marinated turkey, and add the onion wedges, and cook for 10 minutes, or until charred and crispy, turning regularly., Meanwhile, chop the lettuce into wedges, and bash the seeds out of a pomegranate. Roughly chop a handful of pistachios, then set to one side., Heat the flatbreads in a frying pan set over a high heat until warmed through, then serve with a good dollop of aubergine and the charred turkey and onion., Top with a little extra yoghurt, the little gem wedges, pomegranate seeds, chopped pistachios and the remaining mint leaves and red chilli. Drizzle with the rest of the chilli dressing to finish."
Aubergine parmigiana with crispy breadcrumbs | Jamie Oliver recipes,A weeknight twist on an Italian classic,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/51137412.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",In35 minutes,"“Parmigiana is beautiful Italian soul food. Normally, it’s a labour of love that would take a whole afternoon to make, but I’ve cut a few corners here and there to make this this a totally achievable after-work winner. I’ve added courgette as well as aubergine to switch things up a bit, but also because courgettes are a source of folic acid, which helps to reduce fatigue.  ”",487,30.6g,9.3g,13.5g,1.8g,20.3g,33.2g,20.3g,"2                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                courgettes, 1                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                aubergine, 1                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil                                                                                                                                                                , 15g, 1                                                                                                                                                                clove of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, olive oil, 1 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                 tomatoes, 75                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                mozzarella cheese, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried breadcrumbs, 10                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Parmesan cheese, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, extra virgin olive oil, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                rocket","Preheat the grill to full whack and place a large tray on a shelf close to the heat., Trim the courgettes and aubergine, slice lengthways into ½ cm pieces, then place in a bowl.

Peel and finely chop the garlic., Heat ½ tablespoon of olive oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat, add the garlic and basil stalks, then fry gently for 2 minutes before adding half the tomatoes (save the rest of another day) and the same volume of water.  Cook for 10 minutes, or until it reaches a saucy consistency., Meanwhile, rinse the courgette and aubergine, then pat dry with kitchen roll. Tip back into a bowl and toss with 1 ½ tablespoons of olive oil, and a good pinch of seasoning., Spread the courgette and aubergine on the hot tray and slide under the heat (you may need to do this in batches, as you want the veg in one layer)., Grill for 5 minutes, or until browned, then flip the veg grill for a further 5 minutes. Keep an eye on the veg as it grills, then tip into a bowl., Taste and season the sauce, then pour over the vegetables. Tear over the basil leaves and mix., Spread evenly on the tray and tear over the mozzarella. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs and grate over the Parmesan, then slide back under the grill.

Whole Roasted Miso Aubergine | Vegetables Recipes | Jamie Oliver,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/BY25W0We4CD8FEKZgHDOVh.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",,"“I’ve met quite a few people who don’t love aubergine, and I can honestly say most of the time it’s because of the way it’s cooked. That rubbery, dry, slightly squeaky texture is pretty off-putting, but that’s purely because it hasn’t been cooked for long enough. Aubergines are a beautiful thing, and when given the right care they are stunning. Take this recipe, for example – I treat the aubergines like a piece of meat, slashing them, marinating them and slow-roasting them whole. The result is a deliciously creamy and fragrant dish that takes little effort to make. The other bonus is that you don’t use much oil, as you cook the aubergines whole, so it’s light too. ”",124,6.6g,1.2g,6.6g,1.5g,4g,12.8g,1g,"3cm piece of                                                                                                                                                                ginger, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    cloves of garlic, 2                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                green chillies, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    aubergines, groundnut oil, 200g                                                                                                                                                                vine cherry tomatoes, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    spring onion, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                coriander, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lime, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                tamarind paste, ½                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                 honey, 3                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                white sweet miso","Preheat your oven to 180°C/350ºC/gas 4., Peel the ginger and garlic, and finely slice the chillies. Pierce the aubergines all over with a paring knife, as if you were making incisions into a piece of meat., Grate the ginger into a large mortar and pestle, and bash together with the garlic, chillies and a good pinch of salt until you have a thick paste. Mix in just enough oil to make it spoonable, then spoon the mixture over the aubergines and massage it into the incisions, really getting the flavours inside., Place the aubergines in a large roasting tray, dot the cherry tomatoes around, and pop into the oven for 40 minutes, turning a couple of times., While the aubergines are cooking, trim and finely slice the spring onions and roughly chop the coriander, stalks and all. Put into a bowl, squeeze over the lime juice to coat and mix all together. Leave to one side., Mix together the tamarind, honey and miso and add enough water to make a thick glaze. Remove the roasting tray from the oven after 40 minutes, turn the oven up to 200°C/gas 6, and drizzle the miso glaze over the aubergines. Pop back into the oven for a further 15 minutes, to caramelise, then remove and leave to cool a little., Working carefully, remove the stalks from the aubergines and discard them, then roughly chop the flesh in the tray into coarse chunks. Stir in the dressed spring onions and coriander and serve right away."

Incredible Sicilian aubergine stew with couscous | Jamie Oliver,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/46337877.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",In30 minutes,"“This is a fantastic dish from southern Italy that the Sicilians are super proud of – and so they should be – it’s a complete joy to eat. The trick is not to cut the aubergine chunks too small or they will take on too much oil and become heavy, instead of having the lovely creamy flavour and texture we’re aiming for. Jam-packed with veg, this recipe adds up to two of your 5-a-day, and using wholewheat couscous, instead of the regular stuff, will help keep you fuller for longer because it’s higher in fibre.

Pick and chop the parsley leaves and finely chop the stalks, then roughly chop the tomatoes., When the aubergine is golden all over, add the onion, garlic and parsley stalks, then cook for a further 2 minutes – if the aubergine gets too dry, add a little more oil to the pan., Drain and add the capers, destone and add the olives, then drizzle over the vinegar., When all the vinegar has evaporated, add the tomatoes and simmer for around 15 minutes, or until the aubergine is tender., Put the couscous into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and just cover with boiling water, then pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up., Lightly toast the almonds in a dry pan over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden, keeping them moving., Use a fork to fluff up the couscous and stir through half the chopped parsley., Season the stew to taste, then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil., Serve the stew with the couscous and sprinkle with the almonds and remaining parsley."

small bowl with half the oregano leaves, a drizzle of olive oil and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Set aside to marinate while you prepare the rest of the dish., Next make the tabbouleh. Cook the cracked wheat according to the packet instructions, then rinse and drain. Set it aside to cool a little., Pick and finely chop the mint and parsley, then finely chop the cucumber., Once the cracked wheat has cooled, mix in the mint, parsley and cucumber, a good squeeze of lemon juice and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Have a taste and tweak the seasoning to your liking, then cover and set aside., Once your barbecue is hot enough to start cooking, grill all of the vegetables and the garlic and, once beautifully charred on both sides, transfer them to a chopping board., Chop up all the veg together, squeezing the garlic cloves out of their skins and squishing the tomatoes. Roughly chop the parsley and remaining oregano leaves into the vegetables, season and drizzle with olive oil., Carefully griddle the whole marinated feta on the barbecue for about 3 minutes (this will depend how hot your barbecue is), or until golden and crispy, then gently turn and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes., Toast the pistachios in a small pan over a medium heat until lightly golden, then spoon over the honey and allow the nuts to caramelise, tossing regularly to stop them from catching in the pan (do not be tempted to touch them because they will be very hot!)., After a couple of minutes, tip them onto a sheet of oiled greaseproof paper to harden and cool, then roughly chop and leave to one side., Spoon the tabbouleh onto a large serving dish, then top with the chopped vegetables., Place the griddled feta in the centre, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and scatter over the crispy smashed pistachios.

Set aside. Peel and finely dice the onion., In a large frying pan, cook the onion in 2 tablespoons of oil over a low heat. After 10 minutes, add the tomato purée, cinnamon, turmeric, cumin, 1 teaspoon of sea salt, ½ teaspoon of freshly ground pepper, the chopped tomatoes and split peas., Pour in about 500ml of water and simmer everything over a low heat for 45 minutes or until the split peas are soft., Spear the dried limes on a metal skewer, then add to the pan and cook, covered, for another 15 minutes. Once the cooking time is up, add the saffron water and stir through thoroughly. Remove the skewer from the limes., Meanwhile, halve one large aubergine lengthways, then slice each half again lengthways into three equal spears. Salt generously and then let sit for 30 minutes. Pat dry., Heat some oil in a small pan to a depth of 2cm. Fry the aubergine over a medium heat in batches of 2 or 3 spears, until golden brown. Drain on kitchen paper., In a small pan over a medium heat, melt the butter and gently fry the barberries until softened., To serve, place one fried aubergine spear on top of each portion of yellow split peas, with the rice on the side and barberries scattered on top."

Set aside., Peel and finely grate the ginger and garlic, then peel and very finely slice the white onion (use a mandolin if you have one)., Add the rest of the oil to the pan, tip in the cumin and mustard seeds and fry until they begin to pop., Lower the heat slightly, add the curry leaves and dried chillies and continue to cook until the leaves are crisp and translucent. Stir in the ginger and garlic and fry for 1 minute., Add the sliced onion along with ½ teaspoon of sea salt, lower the heat and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the onion is soft., Stir in the tomato purée, garam masala and coconut milk. Bring it to a simmer, return the aubergine to the pan and cook for 10 minutes, or until it’s soft but still firm to the bite., Finely slice the red onion, pick and chop the coriander leaves, then combine in a small serving dish. Divide the curry between bowls and serve with the red onion salad and poppadoms, if you like."

It also contains two of your five-a-day (bonus!), and the nutty-flavoured wholewheat pasta is much higher in fibre than the white refined stuff (double bonus!), so is a fantastic switch to make. The aubergine takes on the most amazing texture, the capers and pecorino add a lovely saltiness to the sweet tomato sauce and the chilli flakes give it a lovely warmth. ”",409,13g,3.9g,8.4g,1.5g,16.3g,60.6g,10.1g,"2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    aubergines, 3                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                dried oregano, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                dried chilli flakes, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                baby capers, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                red wine vinegar, 1 x 400                                                                                                                                                                g tin of                                                                                                                                                                quality plum tomatoes, 320                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried wholewheat spaghetti, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                pecorino cheese, extra virgin olive oil","Chop the aubergines into rough 2cm chunks.

Once hot, add the aubergines in a single layer, and fry for 5 to 8 minutes, or until softened and golden, stirring occasionally – you may need to do this in batches., Add another splash of olive oil, followed by the garlic, capers and basil stalks, then cook for a further 2 minutes, or until golden., Stir in the vinegar and the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of a spoon. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thick and glossy., Cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling salted water for 8 minutes or until al dente, which means that it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of bite and firmness to it., Drain the spaghetti, reserving a cupful of the cooking water, then add a good splash of the reserved water to the aubergine sauce., Finely grate in half the cheese and tear in most of the reserved basil leaves. Add a lug of extra virgin olive oil, then season to taste., Add the spaghetti to the sauce and toss well, adding an extra splash of the reserved cooking water to loosen, if needed., Divide between bowls, grate over the remaining cheese and finish with the remaining basil scattered on top."

Pick in most of the basil leaves (finely chop and reserve the stalks), 1 of the chillies, the red wine vinegar and a lug of oil. Season lightly and blitz to a paste., Remove the prawn shells, leaving the tails on. Butterfly the prawns by cutting along the back of each, and opening them up like a book., Place into a bowl, add the basil paste, and mix well to coat. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to marinate in the fridge for a few hours, or ideally overnight., Score a cross in the top of each tomato, pop them in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave them for a minute or so, until the skin starts to peel away., Drain the tomatoes and leave to cool slightly, then peel off the skins (discard them) and roughly chop the flesh. Set aside., Just before you want to cook the prawns, prepare your sauce. Place a saucepan over a medium heat and add a lug of oil. Chop the aubergines into 3cm cubes, then fry for 10 minutes, or until golden and starting to soften, stirring frequently., Deseed and finely slice the remaining chilli, then peel and finely slice the rest of the garlic. Add both into the pan, followed by the oregano and basil stalks. Fry for a few minutes, then stir in the tomatoes., Add a few splashes of water, bring it to a simmer, then reduce the heat a little and keep it simmering for about 30 minutes, until the aubergine has cooked down and the sauce is thick., Just before the sauce is done, place a griddle pan over a high heat. Once it’s screaming hot, cook your prawns for 1½ minutes on each side, until charred, pink and cooked. Drop the prawns into the sauce as you go., Stir the remaining basil leaves into the sauce, then serve it topped with a few rocket leaves, if you like."

Set aside., Toast the pine nuts in a dry frying pan, then transfer to a food processor with the sundried tomatoes, anchovies and 1½ tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Pick in most of the basil leaves., Blitz until you have a spreadable paste, then season with black pepper and pulse again to combine., Lay a slice of Parma ham on top of each aubergine strip, tearing off the excess to use again, and spread on a little sundried tomato paste., Tear the mozzarella into bite-sized pieces, then place a piece at one end of the strip along with a basil leaf. Roll up and secure with a tooth pick. Serve immediately."

mash with a fork., Peel and thinly slice the onion, and pick and finely chop the parsley, then add to the chickpeas. Squeeze over the lemon juice, then add the remaining ingredients and mix together. Season, and set aside., Warm the honey, then combine with the harissa in a small bowl and set aside., Next, prepare the vegetables. Trim and slice the aubergines lengthways, and thinly slice the courgettes. Deseed and slice the peppers, peel and slice the onions, then slice the tomatoes., Cook all the vegetables on a barbecue or char-grill pan over a medium heat, basting with the oil and turning occasionally, for about 10 minutes or until tender and cooked. Season while cooking., During the last 5 minutes of cooking time, baste the aubergines with the harissa and honey marinade. Leave them to cook for 3 minutes longer than the other vegetables, or until they begin to blacken and soften., Using a sharp knife, split open the flatbreads and lightly toast., To serve, place the vegetables and chickpea salad on the toasted flatbread with some salad leaves."

the onion., Heat a splash of oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then slowly cook the whole garlic and sliced onion for 30 minutes, or until sweet and sticky – keep the lid on the pan for the first 20 minutes to keep in all the moisture, then remove for the final 10 minutes so they get a little colour., Add 2 litres of water to the pan. When it comes to the boil, turn the heat down to low and simmer for 20 minutes., Preheat the oven to 120ºC/gas ¼., Remove any tough stalky bits from the kale leaves, then place a third of the leaves in a low-sided baking tray (this will ensure it crisps up)., Toss it with a little drizzle of oil, then spread the leaves out so they’re not overlapping. Roast for 30 minutes, or until crisp and still green., Strain the broth through a sieve and, using a large metal spoon, squash the onion and garlic to release the flavour back into the pan., In a small bowl, mix both miso pastes and the tahini with a little of the broth to loosen it all up. Stir this back into the main pan and season with soy sauce and mirin., Keep the broth warm until everything else is ready., Blanch the remaining kale in your broth for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with tongs and set half to one side – it is perfect as it is. The other half is going to become the pickle., When the kale for pickling is cool enough to handle, squeeze out all the juice into the broth, and put the kale in a bowl., Scrunch roughly with the sugar, vinegar and a pinch of sea salt, then finely slice and toss through the red chilli., Thickly slice and dry-fry the mushrooms in a frying pan for about 10 minutes, or until they look a bit wrinkly and have stopped releasing water., Pour in the teriyaki and a splash of oil and keep them all moving around the pan for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they have soaked it all up and they are dark and shiny., Cook the noodles in the broth, according to the packet instructions.

Peel and slice the onions, and slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways, roughly 5mm thick., Peel and cut the squash into 5mm slices, then place on an oven tray, season and drizzle over 3 tablespoons of oil. Roast on the top shelf of the oven for 35 minutes, or until soft, adding the garlic and rosemary after 20 minutes., Put the whole peppers on a second tray and place on the lower shelf of the oven for 35 minutes, or until blackened. Tip them into a bowl, cover with clingfilm and set aside for 10 minutes., Peel and discard the skins of the peppers, deseed, then slice the flesh into large pieces. Season, then place in a colander to drain., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan over a medium heat and sweat the onions for 10 to 12 minutes, or until just caramelised. Stir in the balsamic and sugar and cook for another 5 minutes., Place a griddle pan over a medium-high heat. Brush the aubergine and courgette slices with oil and place on the hot griddle for 5 minutes, until soft and lightly charred (do this in batches). Turn and season them halfway through, then transfer to a plate. Set aside., Fill and boil the kettle. Put the spinach in a colander and pour over the boiling water to wilt it. Let it cool, then squeeze it dry, chop it up and pop it into a bowl., Add the ricotta to the spinach, then finely grate in the lemon zest and half the Parmesan. Season, stir to combine and set aside., Reduce the oven temperature to 180ºC/350°F/gas 4 and grease and flour a 23cm spring-form cake tin., On a floured surface, roll out 420g of the pastry, so it fits the base and sides of the tin. Carefully press the pastry into the tin, leaving a little overhang, and trim off any excess., Pick the basil leaves. Sprinkle half the basil and half of the remaining Parmesan over the pastry base, then layer up the veg. Begin with the courgettes and aubergines followed by a layer of the peppers, then the spinach. Spoon over the squash and onions, dot over pieces of the goat’s cheese, then scatter on the rest of the basil and Parmesan., Beat and brush the egg around the edge of the pie. Roll out the rest of the pastry, place it on top and crimp the edges with your fingers to seal. Poke a hole in the pastry top and brush with the beaten egg., Bake the pie in the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden, covering the top with kitchen foil for the last 10 minutes if it looks too dark., Leave the pie to cool in the tin on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then take it out of the tin to cool completely. Serve hot or cold."

Peel the garlic cloves., In a large pan on a medium heat, fry the aubergine slices in generous amounts of olive oil, about 5 to 6 minutes on each side, or until golden brown – you will need to do this in batches, adding more oil as necessary, as aubergines absorb a lot., Transfer to folded paper towels to drain, and allow to cool before chilling until needed., For the dressing, pick and finely chop the mint leaves. Using a pestle and mortar, crush the garlic and a pinch of sea salt into a paste. When smooth, mix in the extra virgin olive oil, vinegar, pomegranate molasses and mint., Arrange the aubergine slices on a serving plate, then top with the yoghurt, drizzle over the dressing and scatter over the pomegranate seeds."

It’s named after the conical-lidded pot that the stew is traditionally cooked in – the design allows steam to condense back into the dish as it cooks, to retain its juices. This vegetarian tagine doesn’t need meat for flavour – the vegetables absorb the essences of the coriander, cumin, saffron, ginger and tomato-y stock. The vegetables should be chunky so they hold their shape during the slow cooking. Serve the tagine as the Moroccans do – over some nutty-tasting couscous. ”",308,3.5g,0.5g,9.8g,,13.8g,51.8g,,"400

Pick the basil leaves and set aside, then finely slice the stalks., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large casserole pan or saucepan over a medium heat, add the chopped aubergines, courgettes and peppers (you may need to do this in batches) and fry for around 5 minutes, or until golden and softened, but not cooked through. Spoon the cooked veg into a large bowl., To the pan, add the onion, garlic, basil stalks and thyme leaves with another drizzle of oil, if needed. Fry for 10 to 15 minutes, or until softened and golden., Return the cooked veg to the pan and stir in the fresh and tinned tomatoes, the balsamic and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Mix well, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon.

set aside to rehydrate., Peel and finely slice the onions and garlic, then place in a large pan over a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Strip in the rosemary and sage leaves and add 1 teaspoon of dried oregano., Roughly chop the porcini (reserving the soaking liquor) and add to the pan, then fry for 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat up to high, then add the wine and let it bubble and cook away., Stir in the chickpeas (juice and all), lentils and 2 bay leaves. Scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands, then pour in the porcini soaking liquor (discarding just the last gritty bit)., Season with sea salt and black pepper, bring to the boil, then simmer on a low heat for 1 hour, or until thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally., Trim the aubergines and peel with a speed-peeler, leaving a little of the skin to create a stripy effect, then slice into 1cm-thick rounds. Place in a colander, sprinkle with a good pinch of salt and leave in the sink to drain (the salt will draw out the moisture)., Peel the potatoes and slice into rough 1cm rounds, then parboil in a pan of boiling salted water for 5 minutes. Drain and leave to steam dry, then place in a large, deep roasting tray (30cm x 40cm)., Season, drizzle with oil and scatter over 1 heaped tablespoon of dried oregano. Toss well to coat, then roast in a single layer for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden and tender., Meanwhile, rinse the aubergines and pat dry with kitchen paper, then spread out across a few large roasting trays., Drizzle with oil, season with pepper and oregano, then roast alongside the potatoes for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through., Warm the milk with the remaining 2 bay leaves and the peppercorns in a pan on a medium-low heat – keep an eye on it. Before it boils, strain into a jug, then wipe out the pan and return to a medium heat., Melt the butter, then stir in the flour to form a paste. Start adding the hot milk, a splash at a time, stirring in each addition before adding more, until you have a smooth, creamy sauce., Crumble in one-third of the feta and grate in one-third of the kefalotyri, then simmer over a low heat for a further 5 minutes, or until thick and smooth. Leave to cool slightly., To assemble, spoon half the ragù over the tray of potatoes, then layer half the aubergines on top. Repeat with the remaining ragù and aubergines., Separate the eggs (saving the whites for another recipe). Whisk the yolks into the sauce, then pour over the aubergines. Crumble and grate over the remaining cheese, drizzle with oil, and bake for 40 minutes, or until golden., Leave to stand for 30 minutes, then serve. Great with a Greek salad."

     pomegranate","With gorgeous Middle Eastern flavours, this salad is warming and filling. The jewel-like pomegranate seeds are a little burst of sourness which brighten the whole dish up and give it that great Christmassy vibe. Beautiful!, Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and set a griddle pan on a high heat. Lay the aubergines out in a single layer on a roasting tray. Bash the cumin seeds in a pestle and mortar until fine, then sprinkle the cumin over the aubergines with a good pinch of salt and pepper and a couple of lugs of olive oil. Toss well, then roast for 30 to 40 minutes, shaking halfway, until golden and sticky., Meanwhile, toast the bread on the hot griddle until lovely and charred, then rub with the cut sides of your garlic. Tear into bite-sized pieces and pop in a large bowl with the tomatoes and the spring onions., Squeeze the juice from half of your lemon into a clean jam jar, then pour in 3 times as much extra virgin olive oil. Season well. In a serving bowl, mix the harrisa with the juice of the remaining lemon half and pop to one side., When your aubergines are done, leave them to cool for 10 minutes, then tip them into the bowl with the ciabatta and add the parsley and rocket. Shake up your jam jar dressing then pour it over the salad and gently toss it all together. Transfer the salad to a large serving platter and crumble over the goats’ cheese. Scatter over a handful of pomegranate seeds and serve with the tangy harrisa on the side."

Place the pieces flat-side down on the barbecue and cook until golden brown., Wrap the aubergines and courgettes separately in double layers of foil with a good drizzle of olive oil, half the lemon juice, all of the zest and a good sprinkling of parsley (make parcels that look like Christmas crackers). Place them both on the cooler coals and, using long tongs, cover them completely with hot coals. Cook for 20 minutes until soft and slightly blackened. (Alternatively, brown the veg on a hot, dry griddle then cook the parcels in an oven preheated to 200°C/400°F/gas 6, for 20 minutes until soft)., Meanwhile, prick the chilli all over with a knife so it doesn’t explode. Blacken it on all sides over the barbecue (or directly over a gas hob) then wrap in clingfilm until cool. Peel, deseed and chop., Unwrap the foil parcels and place the veg on a board. Remove the stalk and skin from the aubergine, top and tail the courgettes, then chop the veg and add to a bowl. Dress with a lug of oil and the remaining lemon juice. Add the peeled and chopped garlic to the bowl, along with most of the chilli and mint.

a great way to cook aubergines, and probably one that not a lot of people would think of doing. To me, steamed aubergine sounds horrible but, believe me, this recipe is fantastic. Aubergines are usually fried or roasted, which makes them soak up loads of oil, but steaming means they go really soft and tender so that they're lighter to eat – which means you can eat a lot more! All round the world there are so many different varieties of aubergines – long, round, purple, green – so keep your eyes peeled and try cooking them all., Put some water in a pan and bring it to the boil. Slice the aubergines in half lengthways and place them in your steamer with the cut side facing up. Steam them for about 10 minutes – to check whether they're ready, simply squeeze the sides gently and if they're silky soft then they're done. Remove them from the steamer, place them in a colander and leave to cool., Now make your dressing by mixing all the ingredients together. When the aubergines are warm this is the perfect time to flavour them. Cut them up into rough 2.5cm dice, then dress them and toss. Serve immediately as a salad, tapas dish or as a vegetable next to any simple cooked fish. Just really tasty!"

Toss in a little olive oil with a sprinkling of salt, pepper and the dried oregano., When the time's up, remove the lamb from the oven, pour away most of the fat, then pick over the rosemary., Scatter the aubergine and onion in and around the lamb, then place back in the oven for 1 hour., Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Peel and finely slice the garlic, and pick and finely chop the parsley (stalks and all). Crumble the chilli., Heat a splash of olive oil in a pan over a medium heat, add the garlic and parsley stalks and fry for 1 minute, then add the tomatoes, a pinch of salt and pepper, a good swig of vinegar, the dried chilli and the anchovy fillets. Simmer for 30 minutes., Make a point of checking the veg and lamb after 20 minutes – turn the lamb over and stir the veggies, making sure they don’t dry out, adding a splash of water, if needed., Once cooked, remove the lamb to a platter, cover with tin foil and allow to rest., Pour away any excess fat from the lamb tray, then tip the tomato sauce over the roasted aubergines and onions., Place the tray on a medium heat, and using a wooden spoon, scrape loose all the sticky bits at the bottom but try not to break up the veg too much – you want it to be a chunky sauce, not a pulp. Add most of the parsley leaves and simmer for a couple of minutes on a gentle heat., Now taste the sauce – it should be slightly sweet and slightly sour, so it may need another little swig of vinegar. When you’re happy, pour the sauce either on to a separate platter or on to the same one as the lamb., Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle over the reserved parsley. Delicious served with warm bread and a seasonal salad."

Peel and finely chop the onion, then peel and finely slice the garlic. Pick and chop the parsley leaves and finely chop the stalks., Rinse, soak and drain the capers and remove the olive stones. Roughly chop the tomatoes. Toast the almonds, if using, under a hot grill or in an oven until light brown., Get yourself a large pan, pour in a couple of lugs of olive oil, and place on the heat. Add your aubergine chunks and oregano, season with a little sea salt and toss around so the aubergine is evenly coated by the oil. Cook on a high heat for around 4 or 5 minutes, giving the pan a shake every now and then. (Depending on the size of your pan you may need to cook the aubergine in batches.), When the aubergines are nice and golden on each side, add the onion, garlic and parsley stalks, and continue cooking for another couple of minutes. Feel free to add a little more oil to the pan if you feel it's getting too dry., Throw in the drained capers and the olives, and drizzle over the herb vinegar. When all the vinegar has evaporated, add the tomatoes and simmer for around 15 minutes or until tender., Taste before serving and season if you need to with salt, black pepper and a little more vinegar. Drizzle with some good olive oil and serve sprinkled with the chopped parsley leaves and the almonds if you like."

She inspired me to think of grilling as a really exciting way to prepare vegetables., Wash all your vegetables. Heat the barbecue or a griddle pan, put your whole peppers on it, and get them really black on all sides. While still hot, put them in a bowl, cover with cling film and leave to cool., Slice your courgettes lengthways about 0.5cm thick and do the same with your fennel, reserving the herby tops. Grill the courgette and fennel together on the griddle pan for about a minute on each side or until nicely charred. You don’t want them too black or too raw. Transfer to a clean tea towel in one layer, making sure they don’t sit on top of each other, otherwise they will steam and go soggy., Cut the aubergine across into slices 1cm inch thick. Every now and again you get an aubergine that is really seedy — if this happens, it will be bitter and no good, so throw it away and get yourself another one. Chargrill the aubergine slices, turning them 4 times until nicely marked, then transfer to the tea towel., Boil the baby leeks in salted water until they’re just cooked. Then drain, rub with a little olive oil, and chargrill them quickly until lightly marked., Peel the peppers but don’t hold them under the tap as all the sweet fantastic flavour will go down the drain. Carefully rub off the black skin, then remove the stalk and pips and tear the peppers up into large strips. Now put all the vegetables into a large bowl., Take about a quarter of your basil leaves and bash them in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of seasoning until you have a smooth pulp. Add about 8 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar, to taste. Pour this over the vegetables and toss quickly so that everything gets coated in the lovely basil oil, then throw in the remaining whole basil leaves. Slice the garlic really thinly to give you a delicate flavour and add to the bowl with the fennel tops. Mix everything together, and serve on a large plate at room temperature. Great with any grilled fish or meat, or as part of an antipasti plate with some toasted bruschetta and some fresh buffalo mozzarella."

Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and put them into a bowl of cold water for 30 seconds, then remove the skins, carefully squeeze out the pips and cut up the flesh., Add the tomato flesh or tinned tomatoes to the onion pan, give the mixture a good stir, then put a lid on and simmer slowly for 15 minutes, or until thickened and reduced., Grill the aubergines on both sides until lightly charred – you'll need to work in batches., Season the tomato sauce carefully with sea salt, black pepper and a tiny swig of wine vinegar, then pick in the basil. You can leave the sauce chunky or you can purée it., Spoon a layer of tomato sauce into a 15cm x 25cm baking dish, then add a fine scattering of Parmesan, followed by a single layer of aubergines. Repeat these layers until you’ve used all the ingredients up, finishing with a little sauce and another good sprinkling of Parmesan., Pick and finely chop the oregano, then toss with the breadcrumbs and a little olive oil, then sprinkle on top of the Parmesan. Tear over the mozzarella (if using)., Bake at 190°C/375°F/gas 5 for 30 minutes, or until golden, crisp and bubbly – it’s best eaten straight away, but it can also be served cold."

Lay your aubergine slices on it side by side and when they are nicely charred on both sides, put them into a bowl. You will probably need to do this in several batches., While the aubergines are grilling, put 8 tablespoons of olive oil and 3 tablespoons of vinegar, with the parsley, mint and garlic, into another bowl and season with salt and pepper., When the aubergines are all done, add them to the dressing and mix around, then check the seasoning again and divide on to the bruschetta. Press the topping into the toast so all the lovely flavour gets sucked in!"

Squeeze the lime juice into a food processor and blitz with all of the other chutney ingredients (removing the chilli stalk) until smooth, adding a little water to loosen if needs be., Pour the chutney into a small bowl and chill in the fridge while you make your fritters., Place the gram flour, spices and mango powder in a large bowl and whisk in 150ml to 180ml of cold water until it forms a thin batter., Cut the aubergines into 3mm rounds., In a deep saucepan, pour in sunflower oil to a depth of at least 2.5cm and bring it to 180ºC over a medium heat – test this with a thermometer, or drop in a cube of bread and when it bubbles immediately the oil is ready., Using metal tongs, dip each aubergine slice in the batter, shake off the excess, then slide it into the hot oil. Do this in batches and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp., Carefully remove from the oil and leave to drain on kitchen paper, seasoning with sea salt while still hot., Drop the curry leaves into the oil and fry for 30 seconds, or until crisp (be careful as the oil will spit)., Serve the fritters with the crispy curry leaves on top, a squeeze of fresh lime, and the coriander chutney on the side."

and slice the onions and garlic, peel and finely grate the ginger., Put all this into a large high-sided roasting tray with the curry paste and a lug of groundnut oil. Toss together until well coated, then roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until sticky and caramelized., Remove half the roasted veg to a large pan to start your daal and return the tray to the oven to keep warm – turn the oven off so that the veg don’t dry out., Place the pan on a low heat on the hob. Stir in the split peas, crumble in the stock cube and add 2 litres of boiling water., Simmer for around 1 hour 20 minutes with the lid on, or until the split peas are tender and the daal has thickened, stirring occasionally, and adding splashes of water to loosen, if needed., Meanwhile, place the flour in a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt and make a well in the middle. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 150ml of water to the well and mix together with a fork., When it comes together as dough, tip it on to a flour-dusted surface, knead until smooth, then divide into 12 balls. Roll each one into a circle, nice and thin, turning as you go and dusting with a little extra flour, if needed., Put a frying pan on a medium heat and cook the chapatis for 1 minute on each side, or until cooked but not coloured. Stack them in tin foil as you go and keep them warm until needed., Put 1 mug of rice and 2 mugs of boiling water into a pan with a pinch of salt. Cook on a medium heat with the lid on for 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed., Meanwhile, to make the flavoured oil (called a temper), finely slice the chilli and place it in a small frying pan on a medium heat with the curry leaves, mustard seeds and a good lug of groundnut oil for 1 to 2 minutes, or until crispy., Load up your warm chapatis with rice, daal and a scattering of roasted veggies, drizzle over the temper, roll up and tuck in."
