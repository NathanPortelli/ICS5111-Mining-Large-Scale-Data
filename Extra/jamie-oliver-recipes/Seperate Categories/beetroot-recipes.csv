minutes or until tender. Drain the beetroot and set aside to cool for a few minutes, then cut into quarters., Meanwhile, in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat, heat the olive oil and cook the onion, garlic, parsley and basil stems for 3–5 minutes until fragrant and soft. Remove from the heat; do not wash the pan., Put the beetroot into a food processor or blender, add the onion mixture, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Pulse for 1 minute, then, with the motor running, stream in the milk. Blend on high speed until very smooth. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, to loosen., Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the bucatini and cook for 9 minutes or until al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving 4–5 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water., Meanwhile, prepare the crispy garlic breadcrumbs. In a separate frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat, add the garlic and fry for 1 minute until lightly browned. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring frequently, until the breadcrumbs are lightly charred and fragrant, about 2–3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside., In the same frying pan used for the onion and garlic, add the cooked pasta and beetroot sauce and stir well over low–medium heat for 2 minutes. If too thick, stir in some of the reserved pasta water., Serve the pasta in bowls or on plates, garnished with roughly torn basil leaves, crumbled feta cheese and crispy garlic breadcrumbs."

Carefully slice at just under ½cm intervals all the way along, putting the veg into a large roasting tray as you go., Peel the garlic and place in a pestle and mortar, strip in the thyme leaves, then bash to a paste and muddle in 6 tablespoons of oil, the vinegar, and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Toss well with the veg, then roast for 1 hour, or until golden and caramelised, turning halfway., Remove all the veg to a board and place the tray over a medium heat on the hob. Pour in the wine and leave to bubble and cook away, scraping up all the sticky caramelised bits from the bottom of the tray., Tip in the lentils (juices and all) and spinach, then stir until the juices have thickened and the leaves have wilted., Season to taste with salt and pepper, ripple through the yoghurt, then present to the table with the board of veg.

Pulse until the mixture forms a paste., Peel the beetroots and chop into 2cm cubes. Place the pan back on the hob over a medium heat, add the paste and cook for a few minutes. Add the chopped beetroot. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 25 minutes or until sticky and gnarly, stirring often., Tip in the cherry tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes, before starting to break them up with the back of a wooden spoon. Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the packet instructions., After 10 minutes, or once the tomatoes have completely cooked down, stir in the coconut milk and a squeeze of lemon juice. Increase the heat and cook for 5 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. Season to taste. If you want the curry a little looser, add a splash of water before serving., For the temper, place a frying pan over a medium heat and add the oil. Add all the temper ingredients and heat for 1–2 minutes, until the spices start to pop and smell aromatic. Turn off the heat and tip into a bowl lined with kitchen paper., Pick the coriander leaves and cut the lime into wedges. Serve the curry with the rice and temper, coriander leaves scattered on top and the lime wedges on the side for squeezing over."

Grease the base and sides of an 18cm loose-bottomed cake tin with a little rapeseed oil, and line the base with baking paper., Peel and grate the carrots, beetroot and parsnip into a large bowl. Finely grate the zest of the orange and add two-thirds to the veg (reserving the rest for the frosting) along with the maple syrup, eggs and rapeseed oil. Fold in the flour, spice, baking powder and a pinch of salt., Finely dice the apricots, then add to the bowl along with the seeds. Mix everything until well combined., Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, rotating the tin after 20 minutes, until the top is light pinky-golden and bounces back when pressed lightly, and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin., Meanwhile, to make the icing, whisk together all the ingredients except the lemon, and most of the reserved orange zest, until completely smooth. Squeeze in a tiny bit of lemon juice and whisk in.

Pop a weight on top to help pack everything down evenly, then put the whole thing into the fridge for 36 hours. Please use your instincts here – if you have a particularly chunky side of salmon you may want to leave it for up to 48 hours to allow for proper penetration., Once cured, unwrap the fish, then, holding the fillet in place, pour the juices down the sink and rub away all the salty topping (it’s messy, so you might want to wear gloves)., Pat the fillet dry with kitchen paper, then tightly wrap in clingfilm (sometimes I like to cover the salmon with freshly picked dill before wrapping, for bonus flavour). Put back into the fridge until needed, where it will keep happily for up to 2 weeks., To serve, use a long sharp knife to slice the salmon thinly at an angle and, as the knife touches the skin each time, kink it off, lifting away the salmon., Arrange the slices on a board or platter as you go. Delicious with a simple salad and good wholemeal sourdough, as part of a seafood platter, served up at a party or even as part of a festive brekkie spread."

Trim, wash and spin-dry the lettuce leaves and place to one side., Bring a couple of large pans of water to the boil. Wash the beetroots, reserve a couple, then pop the rest into one of the pans. Boil for 10 minutes, or until tender, then finely slice the reserved beetroots on a mandolin (use the guard!)., Make the dressing by whisking the oil, vinegar, mustard and capers together, then season with sea salt and black pepper., Drain the beetroots in a colander and leave to steam dry. When cool enough to handle, carefully peel away the skins (you might want to wear gloves!). Slice any larger beetroots in half., Transfer the beetroots to a bowl and drizzle over half the dressing, toss to coat and leave to one side., Trim the French beans. In the other pan, add the quail eggs and French beans, simmer for 3 to 4 minutes, then drain. Carefully peel the eggs, then slice in half., Pick and finely chop most of the herbs, add to the leftover dressing, then tip into a salad bowl., Halve the tomatoes, layer up in the salad bowl with the lettuce and anchovies, then drizzle over the dressing., Gently tumble in the cooked and raw beetroots, the eggs and green beans, then scatter over the remaining herbs. Quickly toss together, and serve with warm sliced sourdough bread, if you like."

Remove and reserve the seeds. Cut each half into quarters and lay the pieces in a roasting tray., Scrub, then quarter the larger beetroots and halve the smaller ones, then add to the tray. Peel and slice the onion into sixths and tuck in among the other veg., Remove the fronds from the fennel, popping them in cold water for later, then cut each bulb into 6 wedges and add to the tray. Drizzle with a little olive oil., In a pestle and mortar pound the coriander seeds with a good pinch each of sea salt and black pepper. Sprinkle this over all the vegetables on the tray and toss to coat., Roast the vegetables for about 40 minutes, shaking halfway through, until soft and golden and just starting to caramelise. Allow to cool slightly., Meanwhile, make your dressing by combining the vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, mustard and seasoning in a small jug or jam jar. Mix well., Dress the roasted veg while still warm so they soak up all the dressing, then pick and sprinkle over the herb leaves,  and reserved fennel tops., Cut the pomegranate in half and whack the back of each half with a wooden spoon to release the seeds, then add to the vegetables.

Place in a baking tin, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and fill the tin to a depth of about 5cm with water., Cover the dish with tin foil, then bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, or until a knife slips easily into the flesh and the skins slide off. Remove the beets from the tin and leave to cool., Peel and chop the onions into wedges, peel and finely chop the garlic, then drain and rinse the capers. Pick and chop all the herbs., On a baking tray, toss the onion wedges in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and season well. Add these to the oven too, and roast for about 30 minutes, or until soft. Remove and set aside to cool., When the beetroot is cool enough to handle, rub off the skins, then cut into wedges (wear plastic gloves for this, or your hands will be pink for days). Set aside., Blanch the beetroot stalks and leaves in a pan of boiling salted water for about 2 minutes, then drain well., Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a pan over a high heat, add the beetroot stalks and garlic and fry for a few minutes, until the garlic is golden. Then turn down the heat to medium, pour in the wine and cook for 10 minutes. Add the beetroot leaves, season, and cook until wilted., To make the vinaigrette, whisk the vinegar into the mustard, then stir in the olive oil and season to taste.

Peel and thinly shave the celeriac, and place into a bowl of ice-cold water with the juice from ½ a lemon – this will stop it from discolouring. Set aside., Peel and shave the beetroots into another bowl, then halve and add the radishes. Slice the cornichons into rounds, then add to the bowl with the  walnuts and dill fronds., Make a dressing by peeling and finely dicing the shallots, then add to a bowl with the cornichon vinegar, the juice from ½ a lemon and 3 to 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Season well and set aside., Slice each bread slice into 3 strips and finely grind the juniper berries., Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the bread and sprinkle each side with the juniper. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until you end up with golden, crispy toasts., Mix the sour cream with a couple of squeezes of juice from the remaining lemon half and add a pinch of sea salt., Drain the fennel and celeriac and dry well with a kitchen towel, then gently toss with the beetroot and a couple of tablespoons of the shallot dressing.

Place the mackerel into the mixture and leave to marinate for 20 minutes., Carry on with your salad. Peel the onion, pick off and reserve the fennel fronds, then very finely slice with a mandolin if you have one (use the guard!)., Peel and slice the satsumas into rounds, then combine with the red onion, fennel and beetroot. Set aside., For the vinaigrette, combine the oil, lemon juice, molasses and honey in a small bowl and whisk well. Set aside until ready to serve., Remove the mackerel fillets from the marinade and place on a baking tray lined with foil., Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to the boil over a high heat. Cook for 5 minutes, or until it’s reduced and thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Set aside for the glaze., Preheat your grill to full whack and grill the fillets for 4 minutes, or until the skin turns golden and charred and the flesh firms up. Remove from the oven and brush with the glaze, then season., Drizzle the vinaigrette over the salad and toss to combine. Roughly chop and add the dill and serve alongside the mackerel."

Season generously with sea salt and black pepper, then whisk until it’s well blended., Add the sparkling water to loosen the mixture, then whisk again and set aside., Scrub, trim and cook the beetroot in a pan of boiling salted water for 30 to 45 minutes, or until tender., In another pan of boiling salted water, cook the unpeeled potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain in a colander, then slice while still warm., Drain and allow the beetroot to cool slightly, then peel and slice. Very finely slice the apple into wafer-thin pieces. Slice the herring fillets diagonally., Divide the potato, beetroot, apple slices and herring fillets or pieces between 4 serving plates., Drizzle over the vinaigrette, chop and scatter over the chives and serve while the potatoes are still warm."

Simmer for 30 minutes until cooked, then drain and leave to cool. You should be able to slip off the skins once they're cool enough to handle. Halve or quarter any big ones, leave smaller ones whole., In a separate pan, add the vinegars and sugar. Halve the chillies lengthways and add to the pan along with a squeeze of lemon juice, the coriander seeds and a pinch of sea salt, then place over a high heat. Bring to the boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Spoon the beets snugly into jars, then pour the pickling liquid on top. Add a chilli to each jar, seal, and leave for a few days to infuse."

Place in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and leave to simmer gently, partially covered, for 40 minutes. Drain and set aside., Finely grate the zest of one of the lemons into a bowl and squeeze in the juice from both, passing it through a fine sieve, to ensure no pith or pips remain., Finely chop the dill and onion, and add to the bowl with the sugar, olive oil, capers and 1 teaspoon of sea salt. Whisk all of the ingredients together until fully amalgamated., Run the beetroots under a cold tap and gently slide off the skins (they should peel off easily). Trim the tops and bottoms from the beetroots and discard. Then, using a mandolin or a sharp knife, slice the beetroot into very thin rounds., Arrange the beetroot slices on a serving platter or individual plates and spoon over the dressing, letting it sink into every crevice of the beetroots. Cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours before serving."

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then cover, reduce to a simmer and cook for about 1 hour, until they are soft. Drain and set aside to cool. As soon as they are cool enough to handle, peel off the skins and roughly cut into 3cm wedges., While the beets are cooking, toss the seeds in a little olive oil with the paprika and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then toast them in a dry frying pan until golden. Remove from the pan and set aside., Make the dressing by whisking the buttermilk in a jug with the juice of half the lemon and a good lug of olive oil. Season well. Chop the herbs and stir them into the dressing. Leave to one side., Melt the butter in the frying pan you toasted the seeds in, and finely grate in the zest of the orange. Add a squeeze of orange juice, the cinnamon and sugar and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and leave to bubble away for around 10 minutes until caramelised and sticky. Remove from the heat and toss through the cooked beets. Leave them to cool slightly in the pan, then spread out onto a platter., Toss the salad leaves with the buttermilk dressing and scatter over the beets. Finish with the toasted seeds."

the beetroots., Hold a box grater steady on a chopping board, then gripping the root end, coarsely grate the carrots, stopping before your fingers or knuckles get too close to the grater. Place the grated carrots into a large bowl., Coarsely grate or finely slice the cabbage, then discard the core and add to the bowl., Remove the stalk from the pear, coarsely grate (core and all), then place it into the bowl., Finally, hold the root end of the beetroots and coarsely grate (you may want to wear rubber gloves for this), then add to the bowl., Pick the mint and parsley leaves, then discard the stalks. Tear or finely chop the leaves on a board and add to the bowl., Add all the dressing ingredients to a jam jar., Put the lid securely on the jar and shake well., Have a taste and see whether you think it needs a bit more yoghurt, vinegar or oil – you want it to be slightly too acidic, so that it’s still nice and zingy once you’ve dressed your rainbow salad., Drizzle most of the dressing over the salad – just remember you can always add more but you can’t take it away, so be cautious., Divide the salad between the tortilla wraps, then crumble a little feta over each., Roll up the wraps, tucking them in at the sides as you go, then serve."

Pick the dill leaves and reserve in a bowl of cold water in the fridge, then finely chop the stalks and stir into the mixture so well combined. Pop the salmon fillets into the bowl, turning them over in the marinade until well coated, then cover with cling film and place in the fridge for 5 hours., Meanwhile, make the horseradish sauce. Add the soured cream, grated horseradish and the juice from ½ a lemon to a small bowl. Mix well, season with a pinch of salt and add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, then place in the fridge until needed., Add the beetroot (including the juices) to a bowl with a splash of balsamic vinegar. Season well with salt, then mash with a fork to a rough paste. Have a taste and add a splash more vinegar if you think it needs it, then set aside until needed., After around 5 hours, remove the salmon from the bowl, then wipe off and discard any excess salt. Drain and finely chop the reserved dill leaves and rub all over the salmon. If you’re not serving straight away, sandwich the salmon together, with the skin-side outside and wrap in cling film, then return to the fridge, until needed., To serve, remove the cling film and peel away the salmon skin, then transfer to a board and finely slice. Snip over the cress, then serve alongside the horseradish sauce, balsamic beets, rye bread and lemon wedges for squeezing over. I sometimes like to serve it with a shot of vodka on the side too. Enjoy!"

Use scissors to cut out a circle of greaseproof paper, roughly the same size as the bottom of the tin, and use it to line the base. Dust the sides of the tin lightly with flour, then tap the tin to get rid of any excess., Break 200g of the chocolate into small pieces and add to a heatproof bowl., Place the bowl on top of a small pan of simmering water over a medium heat, making sure the bottom of the bowl isn’t touching the water, and allow to melt, stirring occasionally., Once melted, use oven gloves to carefully remove from the heat and put to one side – beware of the steam when you lift up the bowl., Use a Y-shaped peeler to peel the beetroot (you might want to wear gloves to do this), then quarter them on a chopping board., Push the beetroot through the coarse grater attachment on the food processor, then tip into a large mixing bowl., Separate the eggs, placing the whites into a large clean mixing bowl and adding the yolks to the beetroot, then wash your hands., Stir the sugar, almonds, baking powder, cocoa powder and melted chocolate into the beetroot and mix together well., Use an electric hand whisk to whisk the egg whites until you have stiff peaks., Use a spatula to fold a quarter of the egg whites into the beetroot mixture to loosen, then once combined, fold in the rest but try not to over-mix., Add the mixture to the prepared cake tin and spread out evenly using a spatula., Bake in the hot oven for around 50 minutes, or until risen and cooked through., To check if it’s done, stick a cocktail stick or skewer into the middle of the sponge, remove it after 5 seconds and if it comes out clean the cake’s cooked; if it’s slightly sticky it needs a bit longer., Allow the cake to cool slightly, then carefully turn it out on to a wire rack to cool completely., When you’re ready to serve, melt the remaining chocolate (in the same way as above), then serve each slice with some yoghurt and a little drizzle of the melted chocolate."

Drizzle with the duck fat, pick over the rosemary leaves, season with salt and pepper, then toss to coat. Push the veg into a single layer, then cook at 220°C/425°F/gas 7 for around 40 minutes, or until golden, crispy and delicious, turning halfway through for even cooking.

wedges","This recipe may sound like a lot of work, but curing your own salmon is much easier than you think. You do need to plan ahead, as the flavours need about two days to sink into the salmon properly, but it’s worth the wait., You’ll only spend about 20 minutes doing the actual curing, and you’ll end up with a delicate pink gravadlax which tastes impressive. Although curing is easy, it is important to follow the measurements, so try to get a side of salmon as close as possible to the weight I’ve suggested here. 

For the first cure, blitz the beetroots, orange and lemon zest, and bashed juniper berries in a food processor until you get a fairly smooth paste. Transfer this to a bowl and stir in the rock salt and sugar. Pour in the gin and give it a good mix., Lay the side of salmon skin-side down on a large baking tray and slowly pour over the beetroot cure. Use a spatula to spread it all over the salmon flesh. Once it is all well covered, wrap the salmon in a double layer of greaseproof paper then wrap it tightly with cling film and place it in the fridge for 24 hours., The next day, take the salmon out of the fridge and carefully unwrap it so you can rinse off the cure. Either use 100ml of cold water or gin. Hold the salmon over a baking tray and pour a splash at a time over your salmon. Use a spoon to gently push the beetroot cure off the fish. By now it should have shared its wonderful flavours with the fish and turned it a really vibrant colour. Put the rinsed salmon to one side and run the tray under the tap., For the second cure, mix together the chopped herbs, grated horseradish and gin. Put the salmon back into the clean tray, skin-side down, and pack the herby cure onto the salmon using your hands. Make sure you cover all the flesh – you don’t want any air getting to it. Wrap it again with a double layer of greaseproof paper, then a tight layer of cling film. Pop the salmon back in the fridge for another 24 hours., The next day your salmon will be perfectly cured and ready to eat. You don’t need to rinse off that second cure – simply slice the salmon as finely as you can on an angle so you get gorgeous thin slices of gravadlax tinged with pink and topped with herbs. Pile these onto a plate and serve with a couple of slices of buttered brown bread, and some watercress and wedges of lemon."

Place in a big mixing bowl., With a sharp knife, slice the celery heart and leaves, the radicchio, the radishes and the fennel as finely as you can and add to the bowl of root veg slices., Toss the root vegetables in the grilled chilli dressing, season carefully to taste with sea salt and black pepper, and serve sprinkled with the reserved fennel tops."

 caster sugar","When I was little, a gym opened around our way and it had a juice bar where they served this amazing carrot cake with a twangy sour cream topping. This is one of my efforts at making boring old carrot cake remotely credible. My mate Peter Begg, the friendly Scotsman, suggested I swap carrot for beetroot, which I did, and the result was marvellous. Thanks Pete!, Preheat the oven to 180˚C/350˚F/gas 4. Peel your beetroots then coarsely grate them into a bowl. Add the ginger, egg yolks, honey and olive oil in a bowl and add the seeds from 1 vanilla pod. Whisk together, then add the baking powder, polenta, orange zest and juice, salt, allspice, cinnamon and flour. In a separate bowl beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them into the beetroot mixture., Get yourself a 25cm cake tin or cheesecake mould. Rub with butter and dust with a little flour to stop the cake sticking. You could also line it with greaseproof paper to be really sure. Pour in the mixture then bake in the preheated oven for around 35 minutes until spongy. Test whether it's ready by poking a cocktail stick into it – if it's clean when it comes out you know the cake's done. Allow to cool., Whisk the crème fraîche with the vin santo, sugar and the seeds from the remaining vanilla pod. Taste and adjust to your liking with a bit more sugar and vin santo. Serve the cake in wedges with a big dollop of the vin santo and vanilla cream."

The best advice I can give you is about flavouring them. A few smashed garlic cloves, a woody herb like rosemary, thyme, sage or bay, and a splash of vinegar, or squeezed lemon or orange juice, can accentuate their natural flavour., Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Put your carrots into a large pot and your beets into another, and add enough water to cover them. Season with salt and bring to the boil. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes until just tender, then drain and place in separate bowls. Peel your beets, and cut any larger carrots and beets in half or into quarters. Smaller ones can stay whole., Now add your flavourings while the veg are still hot. Toss the carrots with half the smashed garlic and a lug of olive oil, then lightly season. Add the orange juice and the thyme leaves and toss again. Mix the beets with the rest of the garlic, the rosemary, balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper. You can now put the veg either into separate ovenproof dishes, or together on a large roasting tray with the carrots in one half of the tray and the beets in the other. Place in middle of the preheated oven and roast for around half an hour or until golden., While the carrots and beets are cooking, lay the pork chops on a board and score through the skin and the streaky-looking part of the meat. This will give you lovely crackling. Look at the picture – you’ll see what I mean. Firmly press a sage leaf on to the eye meat on both sides of each chop. Season with salt and pepper., When the vegetables start to colour, heat a large ovenproof frying pan or small roasting tray on the hob, add a good lug of olive oil and put in the chops. As soon as you’ve got nice colour on one side, turn the chops over and place the tray in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the chops are crisp on the outside and just cooked through and juicy in the middle. Remove the chops to a warmed plate. Pour most of the fat away from the tray and add a squeeze of lemon juice to it. Stir and scrape the lovely sticky bits off the bottom and drizzle all over the chops. Remove the carrots and beets from the oven – they should be nice and sticky by now. Serve them with the chops and a glass of wine."

to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Bring two large pans of salted water to the boil., Scrub the beets, then place in one of the pans - keep them separate to stop the rest of your veg turning red! Parboil for 20 to 25 minutes., Meanwhile, peel the carrots and parsnips, then chop any bigger ones in half along with the turnips. Trim and quarter the fennel., Place the prepped veg together in the second pan and parboil for 10 minutes. Drain all the veg and leave to steam dry, then separate them out so you can hit them with those different flavours., Toss the beets with the balsamic vinegar and whole herb sprigs., Toss the carrots with the clementine juice and throw in the squeezed halves, then pick over the rosemary leaves., Toss the parsnips with the vinegar and tear over the sage leaves. Reserve the honey for later., Toss the turnips with the vinegar and bay., Toss the fennel with the lemon juice, then pick over the thyme leaves., Lay them out on a large tray, keeping each veg type together. If you're making this ahead, you can get up to this stage the day before, then cover them with tin foil and keep them with your spuds till your turkey is resting. Nothing will discolour because of the oil and acid., Roast for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until golden, crispy and beautiful. About 5 minutes before the veg are ready, drizzle the honey over the parsnips., Once ready, give the tray a jiggle, then pile the veg on a platter."
Raw beetroot salad | Vegetables recipes | Jamie Oliver recipes,"A light, zingy bite","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/oldImages/large/438_1_1439306998.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '6']",In15 minutes,“This colourful beetroot salad makes a great little snack or starter and is really easy to rustle up ”,18,0.1g,0.0g,3.6g,0.42g,0.09g,3.9g,1.0g,"beetroots, salt, pepper, flat-leaf parsley, fresh horseradish","The other day I had a nice little roast in the oven – comfort food for a great Sunday afternoon. I had a bunch of raw beetroot to use up, so I thought it would be good to have something nice and zingy to munch on while I was waiting for the chicken to cook – like some tapas or antipasti to get my tastebuds going. You can get some great beetroots these days – fantastic colours., I took the leaves off the beetroots and threw them away, as I didn't need them for this salad (although it's worth remembering that they're edible and that they taste nicer than Swiss chard or spinach!). I washed the beetroots and then, using a speed peeler, I peeled them all down into really thin slices and flavoured them with salt, pepper, chopped flat-leaf parsley and a little grated fresh horseradish to give a nice bit of heat. Then I left them for 5 to 10 minutes so that the acid from the horseradish would soften the beetroot. The horseradish is optional, but it gives a good twang., This salad is lovely on a bit of toast, with maybe a splash of vodka or a little block of crumbled feta cheese. Really nice to pick at before you have dinner."

Put a large frying pan on a medium heat. Season the trout on both sides with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add a good lug of olive oil to the pan and scatter in the thyme tips, followed by the trout, skin-side down (you may have to do this in 2 batches). Press down on the fish with a fish slice to help the skin crisp up. Cook for 4 minutes, jiggling the pan every now and then, and turning for the last 20 seconds or so to finish it off – you want to cook it about 90% of the way through on the skin side., Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix the yoghurt with the juice of ½ a lemon, the horseradish and a small pinch of salt. Have a taste to check it’s hot enough – it needs a good kick. Dress the beets with a good splash of balsamic and a small pinch of salt., Drain the potatoes then toss them with a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of oil. Squash half onto each plate. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the hot pan of fish, then transfer 2 fillets to each plate. Top each portion with a good dollop of horseradish yoghurt, a spoonful of dressed beets and a little watercress, then drizzle lightly with extra virgin olive oil and serve."

It takes just minutes to put together yet it looks amazing on the plate which is always a bonus. It’s perfect for a quick lunch with friends., Using a speed peeler, shave the beetroot into a bowl. Add the lemon juice, a small pinch of salt and pepper, a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and a splash of balsamic vinegar then mix everything together.

Arrange the smoked salmon in waves over a large platter. Scatter over the watercress, followed by the beetroot slices, leaving any juices behind in the bowl.
