Speedy mackerel spaghetti | Jamie Oliver recipes,"Crispy breadcrumbs, broccoli & chilli","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/142094035.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",In15 minutes,"“Here I’m embracing ingredients that are often wasted by bigging up broccoli stalk (it’s just as delicious as florets – trust me) and turning stale bread into golden, crunchy breadcrumbs. Plus, I’m swapping fresh fish for tinned mackerel: it’s similar to tuna, but actually has higher levels of omega-3 and omega-6. If you’re after a comforting midweek meal that’s on the table in minutes, this ticks a lot of boxes. ”",567,19.7g,6g,6.3g,1.2g,29.4g,71.8g,6.3g,"1                                                                                                                                                                slice of                                                                                                                                                                stale thick white bread (100g), olive oil, ½                                                                                                                                                                a head of                                                                                                                                                                broccoli (180g), 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, ½                                                                                                                                                                a                                                                                                                                                                lemon, 150                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried spgahetti, ½                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                dried chilli flakes, 1 x 125                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                tin of mackerel in tomato sauce, 30                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                mature Cheddar cheese","Roughly chop the stale bread to create rustic breadcrumbs, then place in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.

Evenly spread the bulgur over the tray and place 4 fish fillets randomly on top. Loosen 2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard with a splash of vinegar, then brush over the skin side of the fish, and sprinkle over 1 tablespoon of porridge oats., Remove the skin from the beets and finely slice them, ideally on a mandolin (use the guard!), then arrange them around the fish, overlapping the slices and tucking them up to and under the fillets in a nice even layer., Mix 1 tablespoon of vinegar with 1 teaspoon of oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper to make a dressing., Holding ½ a bunch of fresh thyme like a brush, use it to dab the dressing all over the beets, then strip over the leaves. Cook at the top of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the fish is lightly golden and cooked through., Toss 2 large handfuls of rocket with a squeeze of juice from ½ a lemon and sprinkle over the top. Stir 2 teaspoons of jarred grated horseradish through the 2 tablespoons of natural yoghurt, season to perfection, then spoon over the fish and tuck in."

Wash your potatoes and halve any larger ones. Place them in the boiling water, bring back to the boil then cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until cooked through., Trim and finely slice the spring onions, then pick and finely chop the parsley.

Chop the chorizo into small chunks and place in a cold pan on a medium heat and fry till the fat renders out and the pieces are lovely and crispy. 
Spoon the chorizo into a large bowl and give the pan a wipe. Add the spring onions and parsley to the bowl with the chorizo., When the potatoes are done, drain in a colander, leave to steam dry, then add to the bowl with the chorizo. Squeeze in the juice of 1 lemon and pour in a good lug of extra virgin olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper, and toss to combine.

Leave to cool while you tend to your mackerel., In a large bowl, combine the pomegranate molasses, honey and 40ml of satsuma or orange juice, then season. Place the mackerel into the mixture and leave to marinate for 20 minutes., Carry on with your salad. Peel the onion, pick off and reserve the fennel fronds, then very finely slice with a mandolin if you have one (use the guard!)., Peel and slice the satsumas into rounds, then combine with the red onion, fennel and beetroot. Set aside., For the vinaigrette, combine the oil, lemon juice, molasses and honey in a small bowl and whisk well. Set aside until ready to serve., Remove the mackerel fillets from the marinade and place on a baking tray lined with foil., Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to the boil over a high heat. Cook for 5 minutes, or until it’s reduced and thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Set aside for the glaze., Preheat your grill to full whack and grill the fillets for 4 minutes, or until the skin turns golden and charred and the flesh firms up. Remove from the oven and brush with the glaze, then season., Drizzle the vinaigrette over the salad and toss to combine. Roughly chop and add the dill and serve alongside the mackerel."

                                                          olive oil","Start by making the sauce. Peel and finely slice the onion, deseed and finely chop the chilli, and peel and finely chop the garlic., Heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and sauté the onion, chilli, garlic and oregano until softened – about 5 minutes., Season and add the tinned tomatoes, tomato paste and 200ml of water. Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 40 minutes, or until thickened. Transfer the sauce to a bowl until ready to use., For the pastry, combine the flour and a pinch of sea salt in a food processor. Dice and add the butter, then blitz until it resembles breadcrumbs. Beat and add the eggs with about 60ml of cold water to form a dough. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., Roll out the dough 5mm thick and cut out the pastry in circles large enough to line eight 12cm tart tins (or 14 to 16cm x 10cm tins). Lay the pastry in the tins, pushing it down gently, then trim away any excess., Line each tin with baking paper, then fill with baking beans or uncooked rice and bake for 15 to 20 minutes., Remove the paper and beans or rice, then return the tins to the oven and cook for a further 6 to 8 minutes, or until the pastry is golden., Meanwhile, make the kedgeree. Peel and finely grate the ginger, peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then coarsely grate the tomatoes., Place the haddock and bay leaves in a large pan and cover with the milk. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, lower the temperature and simmer for 10 minutes, until cooked. Allow the fish to cool slightly, then transfer it to a bowl and flake into chunks., Cook the rice in salted water for about 15 minutes, then drain and add to the bowl with the haddock., Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, curry and mustard powders and sauté for 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the grated tomatoes, season well and cook for 10 to 12 minutes., Preheat the oven to 200ºC/gas 6., Add the fish, rice, lemon zest and juice to the onion mixture, stir well and cook for a few more minutes. Transfer back to the bowl and allow to cool for 5 minutes., Divide the kedgeree between your tart tins, making a small well in the middle of each one.

Slice the courgette at an angle, roughly 1cm thick – you want the pieces to be about the same size and shape as the penne., Pick and chop the rosemary leaves, then slice the mackerel 1cm thick (removing the skin, if you like)., Put the onions and courgettes into a large frying pan on a medium heat with a lug of oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, stirring occasionally., After 5 minutes, add the rosemary and mackerel and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until nice and golden, tossing occasionally., Meanwhile, whisk the eggs and milk together, then finely grate in the Parmesan., Reserving a cupful of cooking water, drain the pasta and toss it into the mackerel pan., Take the pan off the heat for a few seconds and stir in a good splash of the reserved water to cool it down (this is really important, because if you add your eggs when the pan’s still screaming hot, the heat will simply scramble them – you want the sauce to be silky smooth)., Quickly pour in the egg mixture and shake and stir together until thickened, silky and evenly coated, then plate up and serve with an extra grating of Parmesan, a good pinch of pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, if you like."

Put the fish in a food processor, breaking it up slightly as you go. Add the cream cheese, the zest and most of the juice of 1 lemon and a few leaves of parsley. Whiz for 20 seconds or so, or until you get a nice creamy pâté. Season to taste., Toss the snipped cress, remaining parsley leaves and celery leaves together in a large bowl, and add the celery sticks. Dress with a good squeeze of lemon juice, a splash of extra virgin olive oil and some salt and pepper., Heat a griddle pan. When hot, add the bread, in batches, and press down with something heavy like a frying pan so the bread is squashed against the griddle ridges. Toast for about 1 minute, turning halfway., Cut the remaining lemon into wedges and serve alongside the pâté with the griddled toast, the herb salad and a nice glass of chilled white."

Place a griddle pan on a high heat to get it smoking hot. Using a speed peeler, slice your courgettes lengthways into lovely thin ribbons., Griddle your courgette slices until softened and lightly charred. You can do this in batches if your pan's not big enough to hold them all in one go. As they are so thin, don't worry about turning them over. Place in a bowl and add the drained beans, the chilli and mint., Rub your mackerel fillets with a little extra virgin olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Griddle them, skin side down, for 3 minutes until the skin is golden and crispy. Turn them over and cook for another 2 minutes., Dress the courgettes and beans with the juice of 1 lemon half, a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and some salt and pepper. Toss to coat everything in the dressing., Serve the mackerel fillets with a pile of the salad and a wedge of lemon to squeeze over the top., Tip: Try to find some yellow courgettes – they’ll look lovely alongside the green ones."

extra virgin olive oil","Mackerel is part of the same family as tuna. We’ve come to depend so heavily on tuna that it’s now under a huge amount of pressure – this really is the time to turn to mackerel as an alternative., It’s widely available in our waters and way down the food chain so we need to be buying and selling more of it, and learning how to cook and enjoy it. I like to treat mackerel more like a steak, and give it flavour and attitude to make it sing. It is so delicious, incredibly versatile and extremely good for you., Put a griddle pan on a high heat to get really hot. Add the rice to a pan with 2 mugs of boiling water and a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil on a high heat then turn the heat down to low, cover and leave for 7 to 8 minutes., Once the griddle is screaming hot, add the mackerel skin-side down (you may need to do this in batches). Use a fish slice to press the fish onto the pan. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper and finely grate over the zest of a lemon. Reduce to a medium-high heat and cook for about 8 minutes in total., Meanwhile, make your sauce. Use a fine grater to carefully grate the garlic, ginger, spring onion and chilli into a small bowl. Grate in the lime zest and mix, you should have a lovely slurry. Tear in the coriander leaves, add the sesame oil, soy sauce, honey and squeeze in the juice of the limes. Finish with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil then have a taste – you want to have a balance between sweet, sour, heat and fragrance., Check the mackerel, they should be lovely and dark on the skin side so carefully flip them over to finish cooking for a final few seconds. Check your rice; all of the water should have been absorbed. Divide the rice between your plates, top each portion with a piece of mackerel then drizzle over some of that gorgeous sauce. Scatter over the spring onion, mint, coriander and chilli, if using."
