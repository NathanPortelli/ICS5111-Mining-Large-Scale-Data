Finely chop the chives., Put a large deep pan on a high heat. Pour in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then add the garlic and most of the chives, followed 1 minute later by the cider., Bring to a fast boil, then add the mussels and clotted cream, cover and leave for 3 to 4 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally., When all the mussels have opened and are soft and juicy, they’re ready. If any remain closed, discard them., Taste the sauce, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, then dish up and sprinkle over the remaining chives before tucking in."

Place the heads and shells in a pan with the saffron, pour over the stock, then simmer over a low heat to infuse., Dice the chicken and pork into 3cm chunks, then toss with the paprika and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Place a large ovenproof frying or paella pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the meat and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden, stirring occasionally, while you peel and finely chop the onion, garlic and celery., Remove the meat to a plate and stir the chopped veg into the fat in the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened, then return the meat to the mix., At the same time, quickly drop the crayfish into the stock to cook for 4 minutes, remove with a slotted spoon, halve lengthways and place in a large bowl., Cut a cross into the bottom of each tomato, plunge them into the stock for 40 seconds, then carefully peel, deseed and roughly chop., Stir the paella rice into the meat pan to toast for a few minutes, then ladle in 1 litre of stock through a sieve. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced and the rice is nearly cooked, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley. Run the tip of a knife down the back of each prawn and pull out the vein, meaning they’ll butterfly as they cook., Slice the tentacles from the squid, keeping them whole, then open out the tubes and lightly score in a criss-cross fashion with a regular eating knife., Place the prawns, squid and mussels in the crayfish bowl with the drained artichokes, most of the parsley and the mangetout (roughly slice, if you like), then dress with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, the juice of 1 lemon and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Poke and scatter the contents of the bowl into the rice, then place uncovered in the oven for 10 minutes, or until beautifully cooked. Scatter over the remaining parsley leaves and serve with lots of lemon wedges for squeezing over."

                      , from sustainable sources, unpeeled","Make your dough first. Place the flour on a board or in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Beat the egg until smooth, then pour it into the well., Using the tips of your fingers, gradually mix the egg with the flour until combined. Knead the bits of dough into one smooth lump. You can also do this step in a food processor – just whiz the flour and egg until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip onto a work surface and bring together with your hands., Knead the dough to develop the gluten; this makes your pasta springy instead of flabby when you cook it. There’s no secret to kneading – you just have to bash the dough around a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, stretching it and squashing it again. Stop when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky., Wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes., It’s not the end of the world if you haven’t got a pasta machine, just use your rolling pin. The problem you’ll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces. You’ll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than you’ll get from a machine., If using a machine, make sure it’s firmly clamped to a clean, long work surface. Dust the surface with flour, then take a lump of dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips., Set the pasta machine at its widest setting and roll the dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks. Click the machine down a setting and roll the dough through again., Fold the dough in half, click the machine back up to the widest setting and roll it through again. Repeat 5 or 6 times., Work the dough through all the machine’s settings, from the widest to the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the dough with flour every time you run it through. When you reach the narrowest setting, fold the dough in half, then in half again, then once more into a squarish piece of dough., Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll through the settings for the last time, you should get a silky, rectangular sheet of pasta with straight edges., For the lasagne sheets needed in this recipe, keep rolling the pasta until it’s somewhere between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card., Cut the pasta into 6 sheets of 8cm x 30cm, and cut the rest into 8cm x 12cm sheets. It dries faster than you might think, so don’t wait more than a minute or two to cut it. Lay a damp tea towel on top of the pasta to help prevent it drying out., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., For the béchamel sauce, place the milk and saffron in a saucepan and bring almost to the boil., In a second pan, melt 75g of the butter. Stir in the flour to make a paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the hot milk to the pan, a ladleful at a time, whisking as you go., Gently bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for around 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until you have a thick, smooth sauce. Finely grate and stir in most of the Parmesan and season well., Scrub and debeard the mussels, discarding any that remain open when tapped. Halve the sole fillets lengthways, then thinly slice the salmon., Melt the remaining butter in a large, deep frying pan. Peel, finely slice and fry the garlic over a medium heat for 1 minute, or until golden., Add the rosemary sprigs and anchovies to the pan and fry for a few more minutes, or until the anchovies have dissolved., Add the mussels, shake the pan and cook, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the mussels have all opened (throw away any that haven’t after this time)., Turn off the heat, then remove the mussels from their shells, putting the meat back into the pan (discard the shells). Stir to coat in the garlicky juices, discard the rosemary sprigs, then stir the mussel mixture through the béchamel sauce., Grease 6 individual baking dishes (measuring about 12cm x 16cm each) with a little oil and bring a large pan of salted water to the boil., Cook the sheets of pasta, a few pieces at a time, for about 1 minute. Remove with tongs and spread over a clean tea towel to drain., To assemble, place a long sheet of lasagne across each dish so that it overhangs the sides. Add a mixed layer of lemon sole and salmon, then spoon over a layer of the béchamel. Top with a smaller rectangle of pasta., Repeat until you get to the last of the béchamel sauce, then fold over the overhanging pasta to enclose. Top each lasagne with a king prawn, then scatter over the remaining Parmesan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling at the edges. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving."

stock. Peel and roughly chop the onion, then peel the garlic, keeping them whole., Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat and sauté the onion, garlic, paprika, bay leaves and prawn shells and heads for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Add the wine and fish stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, or until it starts to reduce., Strain through a colander into a large jug and set aside until needed (when you come to make the paella, just reheat the stock until hot, but not boiling)., For the sofrito, peel and dice the onions and garlic, then add to a large frying pan over a medium-low heat with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and the paprika. Fry for 7 to 8 minutes, or until softened and golden., Pour in the wine and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, then coarsely grate in the tomatoes, discarding the skins. Stir and cook for 5 minutes., Lower the heat and simmer for another 30 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened into a lovely sauce. Transfer to a bowl until ready to use., To make the paella, deseed and roughly chop the peppers. Cut the monkfish into large chunks, then slice the squid. Wash the mussels and clams thoroughly, discarding any that remain open when tapped., Heat half of the olive oil in a large paella pan over a medium heat and cook the peppers for 5 minutes, until softened. Transfer to a separate bowl with a slotted spoon. Set aside., Add the monkfish to the pan, season generously and cook for 10 minutes, or until tender. Set aside in a bowl., Throw the squid into the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then tip it into the bowl with the monkfish. Set aside until ready to use., Add the remaining oil to the pan, scatter in the rice in an even layer and sauté over a medium heat, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the rice is golden., Stir the sofrito into the rice and cook for 2 minutes, then add the hot prawn stock and bring the mixture to the boil for another 2 minutes., Sprinkle the saffron and paprika over the rice, reduce the heat to low and simmer, without stirring, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has almost been absorbed., Arrange the peppers, monkfish, squid, prawns, mussels and clams evenly around the top of the paella. Cook for about 8 minutes, turning the prawns halfway through, or until the mussels and clams have opened (discard any that don’t) and the prawns are cooked., Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, cover the pan with tin foil and a few clean tea towels and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving."

lightly score the skin, then lightly score the scallops in a criss-cross pattern. Peel the prawns, leaving the heads and tails on (for bonus flavour), then run the tip of a knife down their backs and pull out the vein. Put it all into a bowl., Pick through the mussels and clams, discarding any that remain open when tapped. Put aside in a separate bowl., To make the marinade, trim the lemongrass, peel the garlic and ginger, then roughly chop with the lime leaves, half the chilli (deseed first, if you like) and the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves). Scrape into a pestle and mortar and bash to a smooth paste., Muddle in the fish and soy sauces, squeeze in the juice of 1 lime, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., Quarter the bok choi, halve the sugar snaps lengthways, trim the broccoli, then slice the choi sum into 5cm chunks., Tear off a 60cm-long piece of wide tin foil and place a slightly smaller piece of greaseproof paper on top. Pile on the greens, add the fish and seafood, then drizzle over the marinade., Beat the egg and brush it around the foil edges, then place another large piece of foil on top. Leaving about 5cm around the filling, fold in the foil to create a sealed parcel., Place on a baking tray, being careful not to pierce the foil, and place the tray on the bottom of the oven for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, put the rice and coconut cream into a medium pan with twice the volume of boiling salted water. Bring to the boil, then cover and cook on a low heat until tender., Remove the fish parcel from the oven and very carefully cut it open (mind out for the steam!). Place on a platter, discarding any mussels or clams that haven’t opened., Finely slice and scatter over the remaining chilli, tear over the coriander leaves, and serve with the rice and lime wedges for squeezing over."

Turn up the heat and allow the liquid to boil for 10 minutes, until it reduces a little., Warm a large serving bowl or tureen., Add the langoustines and cover with a lid for 3 minutes, then add the razor clams. Replace the lid and cook for a further 2 minutes., Add the mussels and clams. Give it all a gentle stir, add another good splash of cider and replace the lid. Cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the mussels and clams have opened and the rest of the shellfish is cooked., Using tongs and a slotted spoon, transfer the shellfish to the warmed serving bowl and put the sauce back on the heat., Add the cream and tomato purée and a little more cider if you want more sauce. Stir well to combine, and pour the sauce over the shellfish in the bowl. Serve immediately – delicious with crusty bread."

(You can make of that what you will!). I was really surprised to find out that Nonno lives by himself, and I was very impressed to hear that he still cooks for himself every day; although there are always friends and family nearby to help him if he needs it. His favourite thing to cook for himself is mussels with pasta, so I’m going to talk you through the recipe as he explained it to me., Get a pan of salted water on to boil. Pour a few drizzles of extra virgin olive oil into a separate little pan and put it on a medium heat. Add the garlic, dried chilli and anchovy, then squeeze in and add the cherry tomatoes as the garlic begins to fry – at no point should the garlic take on any colour, but you need the heat to be hot enough to melt the anchovies. The juice from the tomatoes and oil will make a light, very delicate and simple sauce., Add the linguine to the pan of boiling water and cook according to packet instructions. Meanwhile, add a good handful of washed and debearded mussels to the tomato sauce. Give the pan a little toss, then place a lid on top and cook until all the mussels are open. As usual with mussels, if any remain closed after cooking, throw them away. Add a handful of chopped parsley to the pan., The pasta will now be a little under al dente and only a minute away from being ready. Nonno likes to drain his pasta, saving a little of the cooking water, then he puts the pasta back into the big pot and pours the mussel sauce over the top, mixing everything together well. Put the pot back on a low heat for an extra minute or two to cook the pasta perfectly – it will suck up all the lovely mussel juice. To finish, drizzle over a good bit of olive oil, season to taste and serve immediately."

Heat a splash of oil in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat. Add the bacon, onion, celery and chilli and sweat down for 5 minutes, stirring, until soft but not browned., Peel the husk from the corn and slice off the kernels with a sharp knife. Add the sweetcorn and potato to the saucepan, along with the stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 10 minutes, or until the potato is soft. Blitz very roughly with a hand blender (or cool slightly, then blend in batches in a food processor, returning the chowder to the saucepan)., Add the mussels and cream, bring quickly to the boil and cook for a few minutes until the mussels have opened – discard any that remain closed. You can take the mussels out of their shells, if you like. Remove from the heat and season. Divide the chowder between bowls and serve sprinkled with the chopped parsley."

Always keep an eye on the fire and top up the heat source, if needed., Clean and wash the shellfish, pulling the beards off the mussels and throwing away any open ones., Peel the garlic and bash with a good pinch of sea salt in a pestle and mortar until creamy, then finely grate in the lemon zest. Add a good pinch of black pepper and pour in enough oil to make a dressing., Tip the shellfish into a large roasting tray and drizzle with the dressing.

I remember looking at the pile of shells and thinking, I’m never going to eat those, but my mum said, ‘Don’t look at them, darling, just eat them,’ so I did. Once I figured out how to use an empty shell as pincers to grab the meat from the other shells, I went through the whole bowl in no time flat. Mussels are one of the most sustainable types of seafood. They can be cultivated on a large or small scale, they clean the water around them, take literally 4 minutes to cook and are nutritious and wonderful to eat … I can’t think of any negatives! What are you waiting for?, Quickly wash and debeard all the mussels (pull off any bits that look like wire wool), discarding any that won’t close (your fishmonger will do this for you if you ask in advance). Trim, wash, then finely slice the leek and the stick of celery, reserving any of the delicate yellow leaves for sprinkling over later. Put a really wide, deep pot on a medium heat and add a lug of olive oil and a knob of butter, along with the sliced leek and celery. Cook and stir for 10 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened, then flake in the smoked haddock and pour in the whisky – feel free to light it with a match to burn off the alcohol if you want. I think this adds to the flavour, but don’t set yourself on fire., Next, add the mussels and single cream. Stir and shake the pan, put the lid on and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or literally just until the mussels have all popped open – discard any that haven’t. Use a slotted spoon to move them to a large serving platter or bowl. Leave the pan of cooking liquor on the heat and let it bubble away until it thickens to a consistency you’re happy with. While that’s happening, roughly chop the parsley, then add it to the pot and shake it about. Have a quick taste of the sauce, correct the seasoning if it needs it, and pour all over the mussels. Scatter over any celery leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve straight away with fresh or toasted hunks of bread for a beautiful hearty lunch or dinner."

hold of saffron for this one – it’s available from most delis and good supermarkets. It’s not cheap, but bear in mind you won’t need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you haven’t got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid., To make the saffron aïoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker™ until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper., Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that aren’t tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they don’t close up, throw them away., Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little., Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that don’t open.), Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aïoli."

Scoop out and reserve the bacon, leaving the flavoured fat behind in the pan., Check the mussels – if any of them are open just give them a little tap and they should close; if they don’t they’re no good to eat so chuck those ones away., Tip the mussels into the hot pan with the garlic, cider and a good lug of olive oil. Cover with a lid and leave to steam for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the mussels have opened and are soft, juicy and delicious, shaking the pan occasionally., Meanwhile, halve the garlic clove and rub the hot toasts all over with the cut side, then drizzle lightly with extra virgin olive oil and arrange around the edge of a serving platter., When all of the mussels have opened, they’re ready – transfer them to the platter, leaving the juices behind in the pan. If any of the mussels remain closed, throw them away, they’re no good., Stir the yoghurt into the pan, bring to the boil and leave to bubble away for a couple of minutes. Add most of the herbs and a little of the bacon, then have a taste and season with black pepper., Give the pan a jiggle then pour the sauce over the mussels. Scatter over the remaining herbs and bacon, then bang the platter in the middle of the table and tuck in."

Pour in 3 times the amount of extra virgin olive oil and add the finely chopped parsley stalks. Mix together., If you’ve got them, throw your herb branches on to the barbie so that they smoke., Drain your shellfish, then throw them onto the hottest part of the barbie. I like to put a large metal bowl or a deep roasting tray over the shellfish at this point, so they’re roasting as well as smoking., After 3 minutes use a pair of tongs to carefully lift up the side of the tray and check the shellfish have opened. Remove them to the dressing bowl, saving the lovely liquid inside as you do so. Chuck out any shellfish that haven’t opened., Sprinkle over as much chopped parsley and chilli as you like and gently mix everything together. This is wonderful finger food. I use one of the half shells to slurp up the juices. Don’t forget paper towels and maybe even a finger bowl."
