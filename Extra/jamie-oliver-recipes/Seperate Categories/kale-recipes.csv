Veggie bubble & squeak | Jamie Oliver vegetable recipes,"Crispy, gnarly, caramelised veg","https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/91994145.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '8']",In40 minutes,"“Bubble and squeak is a dish created out of leftovers and it’s become one of our great British recipes. The first recorded recipes for it were written in the early 1800s, when any roasted shredded meat or vegetables left over from Sunday’s dinner would be fried in the pan the next day to create this big and beautiful veggie patty. But it’s so damn good you shouldn’t have to wait for leftovers to enjoy it, so I’m giving you this recipe as a guide. As long as you use 60% potato, you can make the rest up using whatever you’ve got to hand – vegetables, crumbled chestnuts, herbs, crispy bacon or leftover meat. In the cockney cafés they call this ‘bubble’, and serve it alongside eggs for breakfast. Because it often sits in the pan for ages getting dark and crispy, it tends to take on a fairly dark grey and rather ugly colour, but ironically, those are often the tastiest bubble and squeaks of all. ”",179,6.1g,2.9g,4.5g,0.3g,3.8g,29.1g,4.1g,"1                                                                                                                                                                kg                                                                                                                                                                fluffy potatoes                                                                                                                                                                , such as Maris Piper, 600                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                mixed vegetables                                                                                                                                                                , such as carrots, swede, turnips, parsnips, kale, Brussels sprouts... anything you like!, 40                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                unsalted butter, olive oil, a few                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh herbs                                                                                                                                                                , such as rosemary, sage, thyme or whatever you have knocking about in the fridge","Peel and trim all the vegetables, cutting the root veg into 2.5cm dice., Cook the veg in a large pan of boiling salted water for 10 minutes, or until they are all cooked through., If you’re using swede or turnips, put them in about 5 minutes earlier than everything else as they take slightly longer to soften up. If using kale, just blanch this for a few minutes right at the end., Once all the veg is cooked, drain and leave to steam dry for a few minutes., Melt the butter and a lug of oil in a medium non-stick frying pan (roughly Put a medium non-stick frying pan (roughly 26cm–28cm) over a medium heat., Pick and chop the herb leaves, then add to the pan with the cooked vegetables. Season well with sea salt and white pepper, then mash everything up in the pan., Pat everything into a flat layer and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until a lovely golden crust starts forming underneath. Fold those crispy bits back into the mash, then pat and flatten down and repeat the process for about 15 or 20 minutes. Concentrate on building up flavours, character and crispiness., Halfway through the cooking, flip it over using a fish slice, or like a pancake if you’re brave. If it breaks don’t worry, just push it back together., Let it crisp up on the underside then nick a bit and taste it. This is the time to correct the seasoning. Once you’re happy, serve it with a blob of HP sauce and whatever else you fancy."

Mix in the tahini, red wine vinegar, honey and 2 tablespoons of oil, then season to taste and set aside., Remove and discard any hard stalks from the kale, placing the leaves in a large bowl. With your hands, massage in a pinch of salt for 1 minute., Once the broccoli has charred, add to the kale and tip over half the dressing. Add the quinoa and toss together., Put the pan you used to cook the broccoli back over a high heat and toast the hazelnuts until golden, then roughly chop., Add a little more dressing to the salad, toss again, then arrange on a large serving platter., Peel the remaining orange, slice into rounds and scatter over the salad. Tip over the chopped toasted hazelnuts and serve straight away, with any remaining dressing on the side."

Bring to the boil then crush the beans in the pan with a wooden spoon. Add créme fraîche and kale. Add a splash of water to wilt the kale, then cover with a lid and remove from the heat., Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium frying pan over medium heat. Add rosemary and breadcrumbs, then fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden, stirring regularly. Season well., Add the gnocchi to the boiling water and cook for 3 minutes, or until they float., Drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water, then add to the sauce. Fold together, loosening with cooking water. The sauce should look quite wet, as the beans and gnocchi will continue to absorb a lot of liquid. Finely grate the Parmesan and stir half through the gnocchi. Season well., Squeeze some lemon juice into a bowl, add 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and season. Toss the salad in this dressing., Divide the gnocchi between plates, scatter with the breadcrumbs and remaining Parmesan. Serve with lemon in wedges and the salad piled on top."

the onion., Heat a splash of oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then slowly cook the whole garlic and sliced onion for 30 minutes, or until sweet and sticky – keep the lid on the pan for the first 20 minutes to keep in all the moisture, then remove for the final 10 minutes so they get a little colour., Add 2 litres of water to the pan. When it comes to the boil, turn the heat down to low and simmer for 20 minutes., Preheat the oven to 120ºC/gas ¼., Remove any tough stalky bits from the kale leaves, then place a third of the leaves in a low-sided baking tray (this will ensure it crisps up)., Toss it with a little drizzle of oil, then spread the leaves out so they’re not overlapping. Roast for 30 minutes, or until crisp and still green., Strain the broth through a sieve and, using a large metal spoon, squash the onion and garlic to release the flavour back into the pan., In a small bowl, mix both miso pastes and the tahini with a little of the broth to loosen it all up. Stir this back into the main pan and season with soy sauce and mirin., Keep the broth warm until everything else is ready., Blanch the remaining kale in your broth for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with tongs and set half to one side – it is perfect as it is. The other half is going to become the pickle., When the kale for pickling is cool enough to handle, squeeze out all the juice into the broth, and put the kale in a bowl., Scrunch roughly with the sugar, vinegar and a pinch of sea salt, then finely slice and toss through the red chilli., Thickly slice and dry-fry the mushrooms in a frying pan for about 10 minutes, or until they look a bit wrinkly and have stopped releasing water., Pour in the teriyaki and a splash of oil and keep them all moving around the pan for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they have soaked it all up and they are dark and shiny., Cook the noodles in the broth, according to the packet instructions. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan., Once everything is ready, divide the noodles and broth between four bowls, along with the mushrooms, pickled kale, blanched kale and crispy kale for the top., Sprinkle over the toasted seeds, then serve with chilli sauce and toasted sesame oil for drizzling over."

Cook gently for around 15 minutes, or until soft, stirring regularly., Add the beans (there’s no need to drain them) and stock. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes – add a little more stock or water if you think it needs it., Finally, add the spinach or kale and the peas and cook for a further 3 minutes, or until the greens are cooked but still a vibrant green.
