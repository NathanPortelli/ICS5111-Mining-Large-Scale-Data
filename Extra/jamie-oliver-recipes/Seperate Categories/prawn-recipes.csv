Signature curry laksa | Jamie Oliver recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/129998460.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '6']",,"“Laksa is one of the most popular hawker-stall meals as it is labour intensive, though completely possible, to make at home. This is my signature curry laksa, with a strong chilli and shrimp kick, served at the restaurant. It is based on a campur- or kahwin-style laksa found in Malacca – a cross between Kuala Lumpur’s curry laksa and Penang’s fiery assam laksa. The soup has a powerful shrimp base. I recommend starting this recipe a day before you want to eat it to give the fried-off laksa paste a chance to fully mature overnight, and also especially if making your own chicken stock. The noodles are best blanched just before serving. Like any good curry, the broth develops in flavour if left overnight. ”",,,,,,,,,"150

Carefully run a sharp knife down the back of the prawns and use the tip of the knife to pull out the vein and discard. Repeat with the remaining prawns., To make the marinade, squeeze the juice of the lime into a large bowl with the spice paste and 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and mix well. Add the prawns and toss them all in the marinade. Set aside for 30 minutes to 1 hour., Light your barbecue and let it calm down. Make sure you’ve got your coals high on one side and low on the other for control., To prepare the steak, lightly score through the fat, then rub all over with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil, a pinch of sea salt and plenty of black pepper., Place the steak onto the cooler part of the barbecue, fat side down, for 5 minutes, to render the fat., Move the steak to the hotter part of the barbecue and continue to cook, fat side down, until crispy. Turn the steak onto one side and cook for 4 minutes on each side, until medium rare. Remove to a plate to rest., Meanwhile, lay the prawns on the barbecue, with the tails on the cooler end and the heads on the hotter end and cook for 3 minutes on each side., To make the salad, zest 1 lime into a large bowl and squeeze in the juice of both limes. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Cut a few slices off the Scotch bonnet, if you like (mind how you go, it’s got quite a kick!)., Peel, destone and roughly chop the mango and add to the bowl, squeezing any excess juice from the seed., Coarsely grate in the carrot (or finely slice if you want to practise your knife skills) and trim and finely slice the spring onions. Add to the bowl with the cashews., Pick the mint leaves and finely slice. Bash the coconut open (be very careful of your fingers!) and carefully remove the flesh from the shell.

Butterfly the prawns so that you create a greater surface area for your seasoning: using a sharp knife, score down the belly and open out. This will also enable you to devein the prawns. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. You can ask your fishmonger to prepare the prawns for you, if you prefer., Put 2 tablespoons of the coconut oil in a bowl with all the remaining ingredients and mix well. Add the prepared prawns and gently turn to coat them all over with the marinade. If you have time, cover the bowl with cling film and leave in the fridge for 30 minutes to soak up the marinade while you light your charcoal barbecue and the coals have burnt down until covered in a grey ash (see tips, below). Alternatively, preheat a gas barbecue to medium-high., Once the barbecue is ready for cooking, thread the prawns onto skewers (see tip, below)., Brush the barbecue grill well with some of the reserved coconut oil and also drizzle the oil over the skewers, coating each side. Add the skewers to the grill and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side."

There’s a knack to eating these: gather a palmful of leaves and herbs into your hand, break off some crêpe onto the leaves, then roll it up and dip it into the sauce. You can vary the filling.

You’ll need a 20cm (8in) non-stick frying pan (skillet) with a lid for this recipe.

make the fish sauce, mix all the ingredients together well and set aside., Next, make the crêpe batter. Mix together the flour, turmeric, coconut milk, water, spring onion, salt and sugar in a bowl, making sure it is smooth and free of lumps. It should resemble the consistency of single cream., To make the filling, heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a frying pan (skillet) over a medium–high heat and fry a few slices of shallot until golden. Season the prawns with salt and pepper and add a couple of pieces to the pan for a minute., Using a shallow ladle, pour in a thin layer of the crêpe batter, swivelling the pan to get it covered all around the edges. Add a handful of beansprouts and chives and cover the pan with the lid. Keep the steam in and allow to cook for 2 minutes with the lid on., Remove the lid and cook for a further minute, making sure the crêpe is crisp and golden. Fold the crêpe in half, serve or set aside. Repeat this process with the remaining shallots, batter and other ingredients to make the rest of the crêpes."

Peel the garlic and pound into a rough paste in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Tear in half of the parsley leaves, smash together, then add to the bowl with 1 tablespoon of oil., Pull the heads off the prawns and peel off the shells, leaving the tails intact. Run the tip of your knife down their backs and pull out the vein to butterfly them. Toss the prawns in the marinade, then cover and pop in the fridge for 30 minutes., For the salad, squeeze the remaining lemon juice onto a serving platter and add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Finely slice and add as much chilli as you like, then tear over the remaining parsley and mint leaves. Peel and very finely slice the red onion, then toss into the dressing and herbs on the platter., Chop the top and bottom off the watermelon, then sit it on one of the flat sides and slice off the peel. Chop the flesh into 1½cm-wide strips, then into 1cm dice, discarding the seeds, and add to the platter., Chop the cucumber and feta into 1cm chunks and add to the party, then use your fingertips to gently toss it all together., Take a bit of pride in skewering up the prawns, interlacing them with the pancetta as you go – don’t pack it on too tightly., Cook the skewers on the barbecue for about 3 minutes on each side, or until the bacon is crisp and the prawns are pink, then serve on top of the salad."

Fit the coarse grater attachment into a food processor, put a large deep saucepan on a high heat and turn the grill to full whack., For the chowder, finely slice the bacon and put it into the saucepan with a good lug of olive oil. Stir until golden., Trim and finely slice the spring onions, add to the pan and stir. Wash the potatoes and chop into 2cm chunks. Add to the pan and mix well. Keep an eye on the pan, stirring often., Meanwhile, put a clean tea towel over a board and ruffle up the edges to catch the corn. Hold a corn cob upright on the board and run a knife gently down to the base of the kernels, all the way round. Repeat with the rest of the cobs, discarding the cores. Tip the kernels directly from the tea towel into the pan., Add the smoked haddock to the pan with 3 bay leaves and the leaves from 3 sprigs of thyme. Cover with the chicken stock, then put the lid on and cook for 12 minutes., Meanwhile, put the tiger prawns into an ovenproof pan with a few lugs of olive oil, the butter, a pinch of sea salt and pepper, the thyme, cayenne pepper and a small pinch of cinnamon., Crush in 4 unpeeled cloves of garlic, then deseed the chilli, slice and add to the pan with the lemon., Toss and mix well, then put under the grill on the top shelf for 8 to 10 minutes, or until dark pink and golden on the tips. Once ready, take out of the oven and leave to sit until ready to serve., For the salad dressing, peel the garlic and place in a liquidiser with the chilli, tarragon, red wine vinegar, yoghurt, 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and and a pinch of salt and black pepper. Whiz until combined., Have a taste – you want the salt and acid to be slightly over the top, so tweak if needed and whiz again. Pour into a small jug and take to the table., Give the chowder a good stir, then put the lid back on., For the salad, wash and trim the courgette and carrots. Peel the beetroot. Using the coarse grater attachment, grate the vegetables one at a time, all in the food processor., Tip out onto a platter so it looks like a rainbow and snip the cress over the top. Put on the table next to the jug of dressing and dress at the last minute., Add the cream and peeled prawns to the chowder and stir well. Put the lid back on and turn the heat down to low. Put the matzo crackers in a pile on the table., To make the berry slushie, rinse the food processor bowl and fit the standard blade attachment. Add a pint glass or 2 large handfuls of ice cubes, pick in the mint leaves and blitz to a slush., Leave the processor running and add 50ml of elderflower cordial and the raspberries. Pour in 500ml of soda water and leave to whiz until combined. Taste, adding another little splash of elderflower cordial to sweeten if needed., Pour the slushie into a large jug, top up with soda water and stir again right before serving., Take the chowder off the heat. You can leave it coarse and chunky, or use a potato masher to mash it up a little bit and make it silky, or purée the lot – it’s up to you. I like to roughly mash one side of it, then mix it through., To serve, take the tiger prawns to the table with the saucepan of chowder. Roughly break a few crackers into each bowl, ladle the chowder on top and finish off with a couple of tiger prawns on the side. Toss the salad in the dressing, taste and season, then tuck in."

Knead on a clean flour dusted surface for 5 minutes, or until smooth, then wrap in clingfilm and leave aside to rest for 30 minutes while you make the filling., Chop two-thirds of the prawns into 1cm cubes, finely chop the rest, then place in a bowl. Drain the water chestnuts, peel the ginger, then finely chop both. Trim and finely slice the spring onions., Add it all to the bowl, then beat and add the egg, along with a good pinch of sea salt, the white pepper, Shaoxing rice wine and sesame oil. Mix well., On a clean flour-dusted surface, knead the dough a few times, then cut in half. Cover half the dough with a clean damp tea towel while you roll the rest into a sausage, roughly 40cm long., Break off 1.5cm pieces and roll each one into a ball, then flatten into an 8cm round, roughly 2mm thick. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush around the edge of each round with water, then dot 1 level tablespoon of filling in the centre., Fold the dough in half over the filling, cupping your hands around to seal and get rid of any air bubbles. Make the edge wavy like a shell, placing the dumplings on a floured plate as you go., To cook the dumplings, put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Arrange the first batch of dumplings inside and fry until golden on the bottom., Meanwhile, whisk 4 heaped teaspoons of flour with 800ml of water (re-whisk between batches). Once the dumpling bottoms are golden, pour in enough floury water to come 1cm up the side of the pan., Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes, then remove the lid until it begins to fry again – you’ll notice a delicate pancake starting to form and encase the dumplings. When it’s nicely golden, confidently bang it out upside down on to a serving board., Repeat with the remaining dumplings and floury water. Mix up your own dipping sauce, to taste, using a combination of the condiments. Delicious served as part of a wider dim sum selection."

Peel the garlic, deseed and roughly chop the chillies, finely grate the zest of 1 lemon and place in a pestle and mortar. Add a pinch of sea salt and pound to a paste., To make the dressing, squeeze the juice of the zested lemon into a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of oil, season with salt and black pepper and put in the fridge until needed., Place the chicken wings and prawns on a tray and rub all over with half of the oregano paste, making sure you get it into all the nooks and crannies. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge overnight., Soak the wooden skewers in water before use – this will prevent them from catching on the barbecue., When you're ready to cook, preheat the oven to 160ºC/325ºF/gas 3, then prepare the barbecue., Carefully place the chicken wings onto the wooden skewers; start at the wing tip and push the meat onto the skewer. Do the same with the prawns; start with the head, pushing the skewer all of the way along the body. Pop the prawns back into the fridge., Place the chicken wings on a large baking tray and cook for 1 hour, or until cooked through., Cut the courgettes into 3cm chunks, then slide them onto the remaining skewers. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil and season with salt and pepper., Remove the dressing from the fridge and let it come up to room temperature., When the coals of your barbecue are glowing and the flames have died down, place the skewers on the grill and cook until golden – this should take about 3 minutes on each side., Serve on a platter, drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle over the reserved oregano. Serve with lemon wedges."

Place the heads and shells in a pan with the saffron, pour over the stock, then simmer over a low heat to infuse., Dice the chicken and pork into 3cm chunks, then toss with the paprika and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Place a large ovenproof frying or paella pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the meat and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden, stirring occasionally, while you peel and finely chop the onion, garlic and celery., Remove the meat to a plate and stir the chopped veg into the fat in the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened, then return the meat to the mix., At the same time, quickly drop the crayfish into the stock to cook for 4 minutes, remove with a slotted spoon, halve lengthways and place in a large bowl., Cut a cross into the bottom of each tomato, plunge them into the stock for 40 seconds, then carefully peel, deseed and roughly chop., Stir the paella rice into the meat pan to toast for a few minutes, then ladle in 1 litre of stock through a sieve. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced and the rice is nearly cooked, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley. Run the tip of a knife down the back of each prawn and pull out the vein, meaning they’ll butterfly as they cook., Slice the tentacles from the squid, keeping them whole, then open out the tubes and lightly score in a criss-cross fashion with a regular eating knife., Place the prawns, squid and mussels in the crayfish bowl with the drained artichokes, most of the parsley and the mangetout (roughly slice, if you like), then dress with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, the juice of 1 lemon and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Poke and scatter the contents of the bowl into the rice, then place uncovered in the oven for 10 minutes, or until beautifully cooked. Scatter over the remaining parsley leaves and serve with lots of lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Finely grate the lime zest into a food processor, and squeeze in the juice. Deseed the chilli, roughly chop the coriander and peel and roughly chop the ginger, then add to the processor., Drizzle over the fish sauce, then add the palm sugar, and blitz until finely chopped. Season to taste and set aside., Pour 3cm of sunflower oil into a wide, deep saucepan and place over a medium heat until the oil reaches 180ºC on a thermometer. You can also test that the oil is hot enough with a little bit of noodle – it should crisp up and turn lightly golden., Meanwhile, break up the noodles into 5cm strips. Prepare a plate lined with kitchen paper and have a slotted spoon ready. Fry the noodles in the oil, in batches for 30 seconds at a time, turning halfway through, then transfer to your lined plate to drain., Heat 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil in a large frying pan over a medium–high heat, add the prawns and fry for 4 minutes, turning halfway through, or until cooked through and lightly golden – you may need to work in batches., Tip the prawns onto a serving dish, drizzle over the nam jim dressing and toss to combine. Trim and finely slice the spring onions., To serve, sprinkle the crispy noodles and spring onions over the prawns, then bring to the table with lots of forks and let people dig in."

oil, then put on a medium heat (starting from cold helps the fat to render out of the bacon)., Wash and trim 1 large carrot and 1 bunch of spring onions, chop into 1cm dice, and once the bacon is lightly golden, stir them into the tray. Finely slice and stir in the stalks from ½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley. Cook for 10 minutes, to soften, stirring regularly, then stir in 2 tablespoons of plain flour., Gradually pour in 600ml of semi-skimmed milk, bring up to a good simmer, then stir in 2 teaspoons English mustard and 400g of frozen chopped spinach. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the spinach has thawed., Chop 4 salmon fillets into bite-sized chunks, halve 200g of raw peeled prawns, finely chop the parsley leaves and stir it all through the sauce with 400g of frozen peas, then crumble 125g of feta over the top and turn the heat off., Meanwhile, wash 600g each of sweet potatoes and spuds (leaving the skins on for extra nutritional benefit) and chop into 3cm chunks. Cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until cooked through, then drain and mash well, taste, and season to perfection., Gently spoon the mash over the fish pie filling, spreading it out with a fork. Bake for 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp on top, and bubbling at the edges."

Drain in a colander and leave to steam dry., Once they’re cool enough to handle, slice them 1cm thick and place in a large roasting tray. Drizzle over a little oil, then finely grate over the lemon zest. Chop and scatter over half the dill, then season with a pinch of sea salt and pepper black., Toss to coat, then lay the dab fillets on top and scatter over the prawns., Coarsely grate the Cheddar. In a bowl, mix the yoghurt, half the Cheddar and the mustard. Finely chop the remaining dill and add most of it to the bowl, then squeeze in the juice of half a lemon and mix again., Snap off the woody ends, then use a speed-peeler to peel the asparagus into long strips. Gently fold them into the yoghurt dressing., Top each piece of dab with some of the dressed asparagus then pour over any leftover yoghurt dressing and sprinkle over the remaining Cheddar., Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until everything is slightly browned on top and the fish is beautifully cooked through., Scatter with the remaining dill, then serve up."

Deseed and finely chop the chilli., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat, then add the shallots, garlic and chilli. Cook for 3 minutes, or until softened but not coloured. Set aside on a plate to cool., Roughly chop and place the cod into a blender, then pulse for 20 to 30 seconds; it should still have some texture., Scoop it into a bowl, add the crabmeat and stir to combine., Peel and devein the prawns, roughly chop, then add to the bowl with the cooled shallot mixture. Season and mix well., Divide the mixture into four equal portions and use your hands to mould them into patties. Put them on a plate in the fridge for 45 minutes., Get your barbecue going to a high heat, then make the mayo., Put the egg yolks and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice into a bowl and whisk to combine., Keep whisking while you add the sunflower oil – slowly add it in drips to begin with, then gradually pour it in a steady stream until it’s all incorporated and the mayo is thick., Finely grate or stir in the wasabi until combined, and season with a pinch of sea salt. Finely chop and stir in the rocket (if using). Set aside in the fridge until needed., When you’re ready to cook, trim and thread the lettuces onto a large barbecue skewer., Brush the seafood patties with a little oil and place them on the barbecue for 3 minutes., Turn and cook for a further 3 minutes, adding the lettuce skewer at the same time. Char them for about 1½ minutes on each side., Halve and pop the burger buns on to toast for 10 to 20 seconds, until bar–marked., To assemble your burger, place a couple of the baby gem leaves on the bottom half of each burger bun with some pickled onions, then top with the patties., Add a generous dollop of the wasabi mayonnaise, sandwich everything together with the bun tops and serve."

Fry the garlic and chorizo for 3 minutes, then deglaze the pan with the vinegar., Add the passata and 300ml of water, then the orzo. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the orzo is al dente, stirring occasionally to prevent it sticking., Spread the cherry tomatoes over a baking tray, drizzle with the rest of the oil and season. Roast for 10 minutes, or until soft., Stir half the basil into the pasta, along with the prawns., Divide between bowls, top with the remaining basil and serve the roasted tomatoes alongside."

The inspiration came from a Japanese gyoza recipe, but I’ve gone for more of a Vietnamese-style filling, which works so well. It’s light, full of flavour and a real pleasure. Pop them in the middle of the table, then get sharing and dipping – it’s about as romantic as it gets.  ”",407,0.8g,0.1g,34.2g,3.6g,26.3g,73.1g,2.7g,"200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                raw peeled prawns, from sustainable sources, 1                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                shallot, 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    spring onions, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh coriander, 16                                                                                                                                                                                                                    round dumpling wrappers, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                glass noodles, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                unsalted peanuts, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    soft lettuce, a few                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil, a few                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh mint, Lingham’s chilli sauce, DIPPING SAUCE, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    fresh red chilli, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lime, 4                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                caster sugar, 4                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                fish sauce","Start by making the dipping sauce. Finely chop the chilli, then combine with the lime juice (about 2 tablespoons), sugar, fish sauce and 8 tablespoons of water., Pour half into a cute bowl for dunking, and save the rest to dress your lettuce, herb and noodle salad., Smash the prawns with the side of your knife, then finely chop them. Peel and very finely chop the shallot and garlic, then trim and finely slice the spring onions (keep the white and green parts separate). Pick and finely chop the coriander leaves., Pop the prawns, shallot, garlic, coriander and the whites of the spring onions in a bowl, generously season with black pepper and a pinch of sea salt, and give it a good mix., Lay out your wrappers and spoon a teaspoon of filling into the middle of each. Brush the edges of one wrapper with water, fold it in half, then pleat and pinch the edges together to secure. Repeat with the others., You can steam the dumplings for 5 minutes, then fry the base until crispy. But the method I use is how I’ve seen it done in Japan. Place an oiled pan over a medium heat, add the dumplings and a splash of water, and cover. They’ll steam for 2 to 3 minutes, then once the water has evaporated, take off the lid and fry for a further 2 minutes., Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions. Toast the peanuts in a dry frying pan, then crush., Pick off and arrange the lettuce and herb leaves with the glass noodles on two plates, dress with the sauce and scatter the peanuts on top., Serve the dumplings sprinkled with the sliced green part of the spring onions, with bowls of dipping sauce and chilli sauce on the side."

Finely slice the chives., Heat 1 tablespoon of peanut oil in a wok over a medium heat. Add the dried shrimps and shallots and stir-fry until the shallots start to soften., Stir in the minced pork and stir-fry for about 1 minute, or until the pork starts to brown. Season with a pinch of white pepper and a pinch of sea salt, then take it off the heat. Set aside to cool., In a large bowl, mix the three flours together with 400ml water until completely combined. Set aside., Pour 900ml of cold water into a large pan, grate in the stock cube and add the grated turnip, sugar, ¼ teaspoon of white pepper and ½ teaspoon of salt., Bring to the boil, stirring continuously to prevent the ingredients from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Remove from the heat and stir in the pork mix., Quickly stir the flour and water mix into the turnip pan, as it will start to thicken immediately., Once combined, pour it into the foil containers and sit them in both layers of your steamer. Pop the lid on and set it over a medium–sized wok just less than half–filled with water, making sure that the base of the steamer doesn’t touch the water., Steam for 40 minutes over a high heat. Add more water to the wok during cooking if needed – just be careful the steam doesn’t burn you. You can test if the cakes are cooked by pressing the tops – if they feel firm and springy and your finger doesn’t sink in, then they’re cooked. If the cakes give slightly, leave them in the steamer for an extra 10 minutes or so. (You can also insert a skewer into the middle of the cakes and if it comes out clean then they’re cooked.), Allow the cakes to cool completely in the tins before gently tipping them out and slicing them into sections. Typically the cakes are served as 8cm squares, but for a party it’s also nice to slice them into smaller (4cm), bite-size cubes., Place a wok over a medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of peanut oil and stir-fry the cake cubes until all the sides are nicely brown and crispy. Transfer to a serving plate., In a small serving bowl, combine both chilli sauces. Serve the turnip cake cubes sprinkled with the finely chopped chives, with the chilli dipping sauce on the side."

                      , from sustainable sources, unpeeled","Make your dough first. Place the flour on a board or in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Beat the egg until smooth, then pour it into the well., Using the tips of your fingers, gradually mix the egg with the flour until combined. Knead the bits of dough into one smooth lump. You can also do this step in a food processor – just whiz the flour and egg until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip onto a work surface and bring together with your hands., Knead the dough to develop the gluten; this makes your pasta springy instead of flabby when you cook it. There’s no secret to kneading – you just have to bash the dough around a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, stretching it and squashing it again. Stop when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky., Wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes., It’s not the end of the world if you haven’t got a pasta machine, just use your rolling pin. The problem you’ll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces. You’ll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than you’ll get from a machine., If using a machine, make sure it’s firmly clamped to a clean, long work surface. Dust the surface with flour, then take a lump of dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips., Set the pasta machine at its widest setting and roll the dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks. Click the machine down a setting and roll the dough through again., Fold the dough in half, click the machine back up to the widest setting and roll it through again. Repeat 5 or 6 times., Work the dough through all the machine’s settings, from the widest to the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the dough with flour every time you run it through. When you reach the narrowest setting, fold the dough in half, then in half again, then once more into a squarish piece of dough., Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll through the settings for the last time, you should get a silky, rectangular sheet of pasta with straight edges., For the lasagne sheets needed in this recipe, keep rolling the pasta until it’s somewhere between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card., Cut the pasta into 6 sheets of 8cm x 30cm, and cut the rest into 8cm x 12cm sheets. It dries faster than you might think, so don’t wait more than a minute or two to cut it. Lay a damp tea towel on top of the pasta to help prevent it drying out., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., For the béchamel sauce, place the milk and saffron in a saucepan and bring almost to the boil., In a second pan, melt 75g of the butter. Stir in the flour to make a paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the hot milk to the pan, a ladleful at a time, whisking as you go., Gently bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for around 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until you have a thick, smooth sauce. Finely grate and stir in most of the Parmesan and season well., Scrub and debeard the mussels, discarding any that remain open when tapped. Halve the sole fillets lengthways, then thinly slice the salmon., Melt the remaining butter in a large, deep frying pan. Peel, finely slice and fry the garlic over a medium heat for 1 minute, or until golden., Add the rosemary sprigs and anchovies to the pan and fry for a few more minutes, or until the anchovies have dissolved., Add the mussels, shake the pan and cook, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the mussels have all opened (throw away any that haven’t after this time)., Turn off the heat, then remove the mussels from their shells, putting the meat back into the pan (discard the shells). Stir to coat in the garlicky juices, discard the rosemary sprigs, then stir the mussel mixture through the béchamel sauce., Grease 6 individual baking dishes (measuring about 12cm x 16cm each) with a little oil and bring a large pan of salted water to the boil., Cook the sheets of pasta, a few pieces at a time, for about 1 minute. Remove with tongs and spread over a clean tea towel to drain., To assemble, place a long sheet of lasagne across each dish so that it overhangs the sides. Add a mixed layer of lemon sole and salmon, then spoon over a layer of the béchamel. Top with a smaller rectangle of pasta., Repeat until you get to the last of the béchamel sauce, then fold over the overhanging pasta to enclose. Top each lasagne with a king prawn, then scatter over the remaining Parmesan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling at the edges. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving."

stock. Peel and roughly chop the onion, then peel the garlic, keeping them whole., Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat and sauté the onion, garlic, paprika, bay leaves and prawn shells and heads for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Add the wine and fish stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, or until it starts to reduce., Strain through a colander into a large jug and set aside until needed (when you come to make the paella, just reheat the stock until hot, but not boiling)., For the sofrito, peel and dice the onions and garlic, then add to a large frying pan over a medium-low heat with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and the paprika. Fry for 7 to 8 minutes, or until softened and golden., Pour in the wine and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, then coarsely grate in the tomatoes, discarding the skins. Stir and cook for 5 minutes., Lower the heat and simmer for another 30 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened into a lovely sauce. Transfer to a bowl until ready to use., To make the paella, deseed and roughly chop the peppers. Cut the monkfish into large chunks, then slice the squid. Wash the mussels and clams thoroughly, discarding any that remain open when tapped., Heat half of the olive oil in a large paella pan over a medium heat and cook the peppers for 5 minutes, until softened. Transfer to a separate bowl with a slotted spoon. Set aside., Add the monkfish to the pan, season generously and cook for 10 minutes, or until tender. Set aside in a bowl., Throw the squid into the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then tip it into the bowl with the monkfish. Set aside until ready to use., Add the remaining oil to the pan, scatter in the rice in an even layer and sauté over a medium heat, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the rice is golden., Stir the sofrito into the rice and cook for 2 minutes, then add the hot prawn stock and bring the mixture to the boil for another 2 minutes., Sprinkle the saffron and paprika over the rice, reduce the heat to low and simmer, without stirring, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has almost been absorbed., Arrange the peppers, monkfish, squid, prawns, mussels and clams evenly around the top of the paella. Cook for about 8 minutes, turning the prawns halfway through, or until the mussels and clams have opened (discard any that don’t) and the prawns are cooked., Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, cover the pan with tin foil and a few clean tea towels and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving."

Pick in most of the basil leaves (finely chop and reserve the stalks), 1 of the chillies, the red wine vinegar and a lug of oil. Season lightly and blitz to a paste., Remove the prawn shells, leaving the tails on. Butterfly the prawns by cutting along the back of each, and opening them up like a book., Place into a bowl, add the basil paste, and mix well to coat. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to marinate in the fridge for a few hours, or ideally overnight., Score a cross in the top of each tomato, pop them in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave them for a minute or so, until the skin starts to peel away., Drain the tomatoes and leave to cool slightly, then peel off the skins (discard them) and roughly chop the flesh. Set aside., Just before you want to cook the prawns, prepare your sauce. Place a saucepan over a medium heat and add a lug of oil. Chop the aubergines into 3cm cubes, then fry for 10 minutes, or until golden and starting to soften, stirring frequently., Deseed and finely slice the remaining chilli, then peel and finely slice the rest of the garlic. Add both into the pan, followed by the oregano and basil stalks. Fry for a few minutes, then stir in the tomatoes., Add a few splashes of water, bring it to a simmer, then reduce the heat a little and keep it simmering for about 30 minutes, until the aubergine has cooked down and the sauce is thick., Just before the sauce is done, place a griddle pan over a high heat. Once it’s screaming hot, cook your prawns for 1½ minutes on each side, until charred, pink and cooked. Drop the prawns into the sauce as you go., Stir the remaining basil leaves into the sauce, then serve it topped with a few rocket leaves, if you like."

Peel and finely chop the ginger, then finely chop the chilli., Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the red onion, coriander stalks (not leaves) and dried spices, then fry for about 1 minute, until the mustard seeds start to pop., Add the chopped ginger and green chilli, then cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the onions have softened, stirring occasionally., To prepare the rice, peel and finely chop the onion, then add to a pan over a medium heat with 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil and the butter. Cook for 5 minutes, or until just colouring. Put a kettle of water on to boil., Sprinkle in the spices, keeping the dried chilli whole (if using), and cook for 1 minute. Turn up the heat, add the rice and stir well., Fill the mug you used for the rice with boiling water (about 350ml, or twice the volume of the rice) and add to the pan, with a good pinch of sea salt. Bring to the boil, cover and reduce the heat., Simmer for 12 to 15 minutes over a low heat, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked., Roughly chop the fresh tomatoes and add to the spiced onions with a splash of boiling water. Bring to the boil, season, then simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened and darkened slightly., Stir in the prawns and coconut milk and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and cooked through., Fluff up the rice with a fork, then serve with the curry, removing the chilli (if using), and a scattering of the coriander leaves on top."

                sichuan seasoning","First, make the sichuan seasoning. Dry-roast the sichuan pepper and 3 teaspoons of sea salt in a heavy-based pan. When the peppercorns start to pop and become aromatic, remove from the heat and allow to cool. Once cool, grind to a powder in a pestle and mortar or spice grinder., Next, make the chilli dressing. Place the chilli flakes in a heatproof bowl. Heat the oil in a small heavy-based frying pan until it shimmers slightly, then carefully pour the oil over the chilli to release the heat and flavour., Stir, then let stand, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Strain the oil through a fine sieve over a bowl (discard the chilli), and mix with remaining dressing ingredients., For the wontons, peel, dice and place the prawn meat in a bowl. Trim and finely slice the spring onion, peel and finely slice the ginger, then add to the bowl with all the remaining ingredients, except the wonton wrappers, and mix until combined. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes., For each wonton, place a rounded teaspoon of prawn filling in the centre of a wrapper. Dip your finger in some water and moisten the bottom edge of the wrapper, then fold it in half, towards you, to enclose the filling. Smoothing out any air, press to seal. Hold the wonton lengthways with the folded edge down. Fold in half lengthways, then lightly moisten one corner of the folded edge. Bring the two ends together with a twisting action and press lightly to seal, making a ring shape., Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Carefully drop the wontons, in batches, into the water and cook for 2 minutes, or till just cooked through. To test if the wontons are ready, remove one using a slotted spoon and cut through it with a sharp knife. The prawns should be just cooked through. Remove the other wontons and drain in a colander., To serve, arrange the wontons on a serving platter. Stir the chilli dressing and then spoon it over the wontons. Serve immediately, sprinkled with sichuan seasoning."

large pan with a splash of olive oil, then place on a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until browned., Peel the prawns, adding the heads and shells to the pan. Add the cayenne and stock, bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, thickly slice the chorizo. Peel the onion and celery, deseed the peppers, then roughly chop. Peel the garlic, then finely slice with the chillies. Scrub the sweet potatoes and chop into 3cm chunks., Place a large pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the chorizo, rosemary and thyme sprigs, and 2 bay leaves. Cook for 5 minutes, or until browned, then remove everything to a plate., Generously season the chicken with sea salt and black pepper, then place in the pan, skin side down. Turn the heat up to high and cook for 10 minutes, or until browned, turning occasionally. Remove to a plate., Add the chopped onion, celery, peppers, garlic and chillies to the pan with the cayenne and the remaining 2 bay leaves. Cook on a medium heat for 10 minutes, or until softened., Stir in the flour to coat, then sieve in 2 ladlefuls of the stock. Return the chicken and chorizo to the pan, along with the sweet potatoes and the tomatoes. Bring to the boil, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Cover and simmer for 40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender., Finely slice the Scotch bonnets (blanch them first in boiling water to reduce the heat, if you like). Bash the bay in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of salt, discarding the stalks. Muddle in a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and a splash of vinegar. Stir in the chopped chillies and set aside., Slice the okra and add to the gumbo pan for a further 10 minutes. Gently fold in the crabmeat and prawns for a final 5 minutes, or until cooked through. Season to perfection., Finely chop and scatter over the parsley, then serve with the pickled chillies. Good with brown rice and green salad."

lightly score the skin, then lightly score the scallops in a criss-cross pattern. Peel the prawns, leaving the heads and tails on (for bonus flavour), then run the tip of a knife down their backs and pull out the vein. Put it all into a bowl., Pick through the mussels and clams, discarding any that remain open when tapped. Put aside in a separate bowl., To make the marinade, trim the lemongrass, peel the garlic and ginger, then roughly chop with the lime leaves, half the chilli (deseed first, if you like) and the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves). Scrape into a pestle and mortar and bash to a smooth paste., Muddle in the fish and soy sauces, squeeze in the juice of 1 lime, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., Quarter the bok choi, halve the sugar snaps lengthways, trim the broccoli, then slice the choi sum into 5cm chunks., Tear off a 60cm-long piece of wide tin foil and place a slightly smaller piece of greaseproof paper on top. Pile on the greens, add the fish and seafood, then drizzle over the marinade., Beat the egg and brush it around the foil edges, then place another large piece of foil on top. Leaving about 5cm around the filling, fold in the foil to create a sealed parcel., Place on a baking tray, being careful not to pierce the foil, and place the tray on the bottom of the oven for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, put the rice and coconut cream into a medium pan with twice the volume of boiling salted water. Bring to the boil, then cover and cook on a low heat until tender., Remove the fish parcel from the oven and very carefully cut it open (mind out for the steam!). Place on a platter, discarding any mussels or clams that haven’t opened., Finely slice and scatter over the remaining chilli, tear over the coriander leaves, and serve with the rice and lime wedges for squeezing over."

Halve the white part lengthways, then finely slice., Finely slice the shallots, then peel, deseed and cut the tomatoes into cubes. Roughly chop the parsley, including the stalks., Melt the butter in a large pan over a low heat and gently fry the leeks, shallots, tomatoes and parsley until soft., Season, then add the stock and 500ml of cider. Turn up the heat and allow the liquid to boil for 10 minutes, until it reduces a little., Warm a large serving bowl or tureen., Add the langoustines and cover with a lid for 3 minutes, then add the razor clams. Replace the lid and cook for a further 2 minutes., Add the mussels and clams. Give it all a gentle stir, add another good splash of cider and replace the lid. Cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the mussels and clams have opened and the rest of the shellfish is cooked., Using tongs and a slotted spoon, transfer the shellfish to the warmed serving bowl and put the sauce back on the heat., Add the cream and tomato purée and a little more cider if you want more sauce. Stir well to combine, and pour the sauce over the shellfish in the bowl. Serve immediately – delicious with crusty bread."

and finely slice with the chilli, then peel and matchstick the ginger., Put a 25cm shallow casserole pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, the spring onions, chilli, ginger, curry leaves and all the spices. Stir and fry for 5 minutes, or until lightly golden., Meanwhile, remove the prawn heads and stir them into the pan as you go for serious added flavour, then add the rice and 1.2 litres of boiling water., Simmer for 10 minutes while you peel the rest of the prawns (I leave the tails on), then use a small sharp knife to lightly score down the backs and devein them, which will mean they butterfly as they cook. Keep in the fridge until needed., Halve and add the tomatoes to the pan, then cover with the coconut milk. Simmer for 20 minutes, then cut the fish in half across the middle and place in the pan for a further 10 minutes, or until the fish and rice are cooked through, adding the prawns for the last 5 minutes., Pick out the prawn heads, squeeze out all the lovely juices, then discard, and loosen the stew with a little boiling water, if needed. 
Have a taste, and season to perfection with sea salt, black pepper and lemon juice., One-by-one, puff up your dry poppadoms in the microwave for around 30 seconds each and serve with the stew."

Fry for 1 minute, stir in the whole prawns and fry until turning pink, then add the chopped prawns. Cook for another minute, stir in the tomatoes, then cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Remove from the heat and leave to cool., Deseed the chillies and peel the remaining clove of garlic, then roughly chop. Place into a pestle and mortar and pound to a rough paste. Add half the toasted peanuts and bash well. Squeeze in the juice from 2 limes, add the fish sauce and 2 tablespoons of honey, then mix well. Taste and add more lime juice or honey, if needed, then place into a large bowl., Halve the cucumber lengthways, scoop out the watery seeds, then very finely slice with a mandolin (use the guard!). Peel and very finely shred the green papaya (or the cabbage, if using), then add to the dressing., Trim and finely slice the spring onions, pick and roughly chop the basil leaves, then add to the bowl with the whole coriander leaves. Add the cooled prawn mixture and toss well. Roughly chop and scatter over the remaining peanuts and serve with lime wedges for squeezing over."

Very finely slice the chives and prawns, then place it all into a bowl with the crabmeat, oyster sauce and sesame oil. Mix well to combine., Lay the wonton wrappers on a clean work surface and cover with a damp tea towel to stop them drying out. Lightly dust a tray with cornflour and place a small bowl of water alongside it. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the filling onto the middle of a wrapper, brush the edges with a little water, then bring them up over the filling, pinching them to seal. Place on the flour-dusted tray, then repeat with the remaining ingredients – you should end up with 30 in total., Pour 5cm of boiling water into a wok or saucepan over a medium-high heat and bring to the boil. Cut out a circle of greaseproof paper so it fits snugly into a bamboo steamer, grease one side with oil, then place oil-side up into the steamer. Add the wontons in a single layer (you’ll need to do this in batches), place the basket on top of the pan, cover and steam for 7 to 8 minutes, or until cooked through. Serve with chilli sauce."

Preheat a large griddle pan over a high heat, add the pineapple for 4 minutes, or until charred and bar-marked, turning occasionally, then remove to a board to cool. Meanwhile, halve, deseed and finely slice the peppers lengthways. Add to the griddle for about 3 minutes, or until slightly softened and bar-marked, turning halfway., Peel the garlic and deseed the chillies, then roughly chop and place into a pestle and mortar. Bash with a pinch of salt to a rough paste. Peel, finely chop and add the ginger, then bash until broken down and combined. Place the chilli paste into a large bowl with the prawns and a splash of oil, then mix well., Heat a lug of oil in a large wok or non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the prawn mixture and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until just cooked through. Meanwhile, chop the cooled pineapple into bite-sized chunks. In a bowl, combine the pineapple juice, vinegar, soy, cornflour and a splash of water, then add to the wok with the chargrilled pineapple and peppers.

Place a large frying pan over a high heat. Add the pork, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, and fry for 5 minutes, until golden. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool., In a large bowl, combine the prawns with ¼ teaspoon of salt and mix until tacky and binding together. Add the rest of the filling ingredients and the pork, and mix to combine. Set aside while you make the dumpling skins., In a separate bowl, mix the flour with 25g of the potato starch and 200ml of boiling water. Add the remaining potato starch and knead into a dough. Pull off 1 teaspoon of the dough, flatten it and, using a pastry knife or rolling pin, roll it on a lightly floured surface to form a circle, about 8cm in diameter., Put 1 teaspoon of filling in the middle of the circle. Fold it into a half-moon shape, pushing one side into small pleats as you press the edges together to seal – this creates the classic ‘har kau’ shape., To fold your dumplings into rabbits, gently press and elongate the sealed edge by about 2cm, then snip in half with scissors. Fold each side of them back and pinch so that they resemble bunny ears. Make two dimples in the front of the dumpling and add a black sesame seed or dab of food colouring into each one to make the eyes., Set a steamer basket over a pan of boiling water. Put each dumpling on a square of baking paper, pop in the steamer, cover with the lid and cook for 8 minutes. Serve with soy and chilli sauces for dipping."

Combine the prawns, tarragon and olive oil in a small bowl and season generously. For the egg wash, whisk the egg and milk in a small bowl and set aside., Lightly flour a work surface and roll out half of the pastry to a rectangular shape about 5mm thick and 10cm longer than the fish fillets (for the head and tail). Transfer to a lightly oiled baking tin., Place one of the fillets, skin-side down, on the pastry, leaving a little more space at one end for the tail shape. Spoon the prawn and tarragon mixture over the fish and place the other fillet on top. Brush the edges of the pastry with the egg wash., Roll out the remaining pastry to the same size and use this to cover the fish, pressing the edges carefully to seal them. Use a small, sharp knife to trim the excess and create your fish shape. Then, with a teaspoon, score half-moon shapes into the pastry in the style of fish scales (but don’t pierce the pastry)., Roll the off-cut pastry to 1cm thick, cut out a few thin strips to shape into fins, and tear off a small piece and roll into a ball for the fish’s eye. Build your fish shape, brush with the remaining egg wash, then bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 220ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and cook for another 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the fish is cooked., Meanwhile, make the salsa verde. Roughly chop the herb leaves in the centre of a large chopping board. Add the garlic, cornichons, capers and anchovies and continue chopping until fine, mixing it together as you go. Transfer to a bowl, stir in the olive oil and vinegar, and season well., To serve, transfer the fish to a platter and serve in slices with the salsa verde and salad."

Coarsely grate the palm sugar into a bowl, add the tamarind paste, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, a dash of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of boiling water and mix well so the sugar dissolves. Taste, and adjust the flavours if needed – you’re looking for sweet, sour and slightly salty., Halve, deseed and finely slice the chillies, then place in a bowl with the juice from 1 lime to make a quick pickle., Drain the noodles and toss in a little oil., Peel and roughly chop the shallots, then trim and finely slice the chives. Pick and roughly chop most of the basil and mint leaves., Slice the tofu into rough 1cm chunks. Run the tip of a knife down the back of each prawn and pull out the vein, meaning they’ll butterfly as they cook. Rinse the dried shrimps under cold running water, then pat dry with kitchen paper., Place a large wok on a medium heat with a splash of oil, then add the dried shrimps, peanuts and chilli flakes. Toss for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden., Take the pan off the heat, transfer half the mixture to a pestle and mortar and lightly crush, keeping to one side. Return the pan to a medium-high heat with another splash of oil, adding the shallots to the mix. Fry for 2 minutes, or until turning golden., Toss in the prawns, chives, chopped herbs and shredded radish, then cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes, or until the prawns are almost cooked through., Beat and add the egg, cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then fold through and toss in the tofu, noodles, beansprouts and tamarind sauce until well combined., Divide the pad Thai between bowls, sprinkle over the crushed nut mixture from the mortar and pick over the remaining mint and basil leaves. Serve with the quick pickled chillies and lime wedges for squeezing over. Delicious!"

Season well and mash in the butter., For the guacamole-style dressing, halve and destone the avocados, then scrape the flesh into a medium bowl. Season with sea salt and black pepper and squeeze over the lime juice., Peel and grate in the onion along with the tomato, then mash together to a chunky guacamole. Chop the coriander and add it to the guacamole with plenty of extra virgin olive oil, then leave to one side., Peel and finely chop the onion, then place into a small bowl with the lime zest and juice. Toss together and leave to one side for 5 to 10 minutes., Finely chop the prawns and mix together with the crabmeat and aji amarillo paste, seasoning well. Mix in the onions, leaving behind the excess juice., Line up 3 bowls – one with flour, one with beaten eggs and one with breadcrumbs., Place a scoop of mashed potato in your hand and roll into a ball (roughly 4cm in diameter). Press a hole in the middle with your thumb, about 2cm deep, and spoon in some prawn and crab mixture., Close the hole as gently as you can to conceal the filling, then repeat until you’ve used up all the mash and filling – you should end up with around 15 croquettes., Roll each croquette in the flour, dip it into the egg (letting the excess drip off), then coat in breadcrumbs., Pour the vegetable oil into a large pan and gently heat to 180°C (a cube of bread dropped into the oil will turn brown within 1 minute)., Gently lower the croquettes into the oil with a slotted spoon and fry for around 4 minutes, or until golden and crisp – you’ll need to do this in batches., Drain the cooked croquettes on kitchen paper, then serve hot on a plate smeared with the guacamole."

The biggest one was for about 800 people in a village in Spain and it was hard work, but an incredible experience. The Spanish can be quite protective about what is and what isn’t a paella, but at the same time, the spirit of their cooking has always been flexible to whatever meat, fish, seafood or game can be found. I’ve eaten and enjoyed many paellas, and I hope you like my humble, great-value expression of one. ”",494,12g,3.3g,8.5g,1.6g,26.5g,75.7g,5.7g,"2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onion, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    carrot, ½ a                                                                                                                                                                bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh flat-leaf parsley                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), 70                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                quality chorizo, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    free-range chicken thighs                                                                                                                                                                , skin off, bone out, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                sweet smoked paprika, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red pepper, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                tomato purée, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    organic chicken stock cube, 300                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                paella rice, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                frozen peas, 200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                frozen peeled cooked prawns                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon","Peel and finely slice the garlic, peel and roughly chop the onion and carrot. Finely chop the parsley stalks, then roughly chop the chorizo and chicken thighs., Put a lug of oil into a large lidded shallow casserole or paella pan on a medium heat, add the garlic, onion, carrot, parsley stalks, chorizo, chicken and paprika, and fry for around 5 minutes, stirring regularly., Deseed and chop the pepper, then add to the pan for a further 5 minutes., Stir through the tomato purée and crumble in the stock cube, then add the rice and stir for a couple of minutes so it starts to suck up all that lovely flavour., Pour in 750ml of boiling water and add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Pop the lid on and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 15 minutes, stirring regularly from the outside in and from the inside out, and adding a splash of water if needed., Stir in the peas and prawns, replace the lid, and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until hot through., Season to perfection, then chop the parsley leaves, scatter them over the paella, and serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over."

Pick the coriander leaves, finely chopping the stalks, and deseed and slice the peppers., Put your largest roasting tray on the hob over a medium heat, and drizzle in 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the spices and curry leaves and fry for 2 minutes, then add the chopped veg, garlic and coriander stalks. Cook for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Place the salmon into the tray, skin-side down. Season with sea salt and black pepper, and drizzle lightly with oil. After 1 minute, carefully turn the salmon skin-side up, then place the tray in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the salmon is almost cooked through., Quarter the tomatoes, and run the tip of a knife down the backs of the prawns and pull out the vein, meaning they'll butterfly as they cook., Remove the tray from the oven and preheat the grill to full whack. Carefully peel the skin off the salmon and place onto a piece of tin foil., Stir the tomatoes, prawns and coconut milk into the tray, then finely grate over the zest from 1 lemon and squeeze over the juice. Gently simmer on the hob over a medium-low heat until the prawns are just cooked through., Place the salmon skin under the grill for 5 minutes, or until lovely and crisp, then leave to cool., Break the salmon into big chunks. Season the sauce to taste with salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, then snap up and scatter over the crispy salmon skin., Sprinkle over the coriander leaves and serve with lots of lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Pour in your grits or cornmeal and cook according to the packet instructions. If you’re using polenta, check the packet to make sure the ratio of water to polenta is the same. Be sure to stand over the pan and stir constantly to make sure there are no lumps and it doesn’t catch. When your grits are ready, add the butter and grated cheese, and stir and beat in really well. Have a taste and add some seasoning to the point where it’s delicious. Pop the lid on the pan to keep the grits warm while you crack on., PRAWN & SAUSAGE TOPPING Get a large frying pan on a medium heat. Squeeze the sausages out of their skins bit by bit and roll the meat into little 2cm balls. Don’t go getting fancy, just pack them into roundish shapes. Once you’ve done that with all your sausages, turn the heat up under the pan and add the meatballs to the pan with a few lugs of olive oil., Shake the pan every now and then, and after 4 or 5 minutes the meatballs should be looking gorgeous all over. Add your prawns and chopped garlic and sprinkle in your smoked paprika. Give everything a good shake and within about 2 minutes the prawns will be perfectly cooked, so add a knob of butter and cook for another minute or two, shaking and stirring every 10 seconds or so. Take the pan off the heat, squeeze in the juice of your lemon, add your chopped parsley and season to taste with a pinch of salt and pepper., TO SERVE Let everything mix together, and stir around to pick up any flavours from the bottom of the pan. Have a taste and check you’re happy with it. Stir a splash of boiling water into your grits to bring them back to life, and divide between your plates.

Drain and mash well with a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, the zest from the lemon and the butter. Set aside., Peel and chop the carrots and onions, then fry them in a large ovenproof pan (roughly 30cm in diameter) with 1 tablespoon of oil over a medium heat for 15 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, heat the milk in a pan on a medium heat. Once simmering, add all the frozen fish fillets and cook for around 10 minutes, or until cooked through, then use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a plate, taking the pan off the heat., Stir the flour into the carrots and onions, then gradually add the warm milk, a ladleful at a time, stirring continuously until you have a smooth sauce. Stir in the spinach until thawed and incorporated, then season to perfection., Flake in the cooked fish fillets (carefully remove and discard any skin or bones), add the prawns and mustard, along with the juice of half the lemon, grate in the Cheddar, and stir gently to combine., Top with the pea-spiked mash and smooth out, scuffing it up slightly with a fork to give it texture that will crisp up. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until beautifully golden. Serve with a good old helping of baked beans (if you like). Delicious!"

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the chillies, garlic, a good pinch of salt and a good splash of vinegar, then cook over a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it coats the back of a spoon. For a smooth syrupy texture, whiz the sauce in a food processor if you like, or leave it finely chopped, then put to one side., Place a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep saucepan over a medium–high heat (roughly 180ºC). Fill three-quarters full with vegetable oil and leave to heat up., Meanwhile, wash and pat dry the squid. Slice the tubes horizontally into rings or slice and open them out, then halve lengthways and cut a crisscross pattern onto the surface. Place the squid onto a large plate, along with the prawns, making sure any black bits have been removed. Finely grate over the zest of the limes and squeeze over most of the juice, then toss to coat., Place the flour and a good pinch of salt and pepper into a large bowl, then add the squid and prawns and toss to coat (you’ll need to do this in batches)., To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a piece of bread into the pan – if the bread floats to the surface, sizzles and turns golden, it’s about right. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower the prawns and squid into the hot oil and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden and crisp on the outside and cooked through (you’ll need to do this in batches). Transfer the cooked prawns and squid to a double-layer of kitchen paper, then repeat with the remaining seafood., When the last batch of seafood is almost done, squeeze a little lime juice over the parsley sprigs, then dip into the flour and lower into the oil for a few seconds – be careful as it’ll spit., Serve the crispy squid and prawns straight away, with crispy lime-spiked parsley, lemon wedges for squeezing over and the sweet chilli sauce on the side for dipping. Keep any leftover chilli sauce in sterilised bottles and store for up to 2 months in a cool dry place."

Fry everything together for a minute then add the sliced chorizo. Cook for another few minutes until the sausage starts to brown, then pour in the white wine, tinned tomatoes, rice and chickpeas. Season well and simmer for 10 minutes, until the rice is just about cooked., Meanwhile, put a frying pan on a medium heat to make the pangrattato. Add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and let it heat up for a minute or so, then add the breadcrumbs, flat-leaf parsley and lemon zest. Fry for a couple of minutes until it’s all golden brown and crispy then put to one side., After the soup has simmered for 10 minutes, it should have thickened a little, so stir in about 200ml of hot water and bring everything to the boil. Cut each of the fish fillets into three pieces, then, carefully, so you don’t get splashed by any of the hot liquid, place them and the prawns into the mixture. Cook for a further 5 minutes until the fish is cooked through and the prawns are pink., When the fish is perfectly cooked, stir through the basil leaves. Ladle the soup into warm bowls and top each with a nice big spoonful of pangrattato. Serve with a few wedges of lemon to squeeze over the finished dish and enjoy all those gorgeous flavours!"

Place the salmon onto a baking tray and sprinkle with salt and pepper then drizzle with a little olive oil and place in the hot oven for 8 to 10 minutes., While the salmon is in the oven, make the Marie Rose dressing. Mix the yoghurt and ketchup in a small bowl then add the zest and juice of one of the lemons. Season well with salt and pepper and add a dash of Tabasco for a bit of a kick. You want a loose, dressing-like consistency so you’re able to drizzle it over your salad. Taste and check it's to your liking. You can add more lemon and Tabasco if it needs a bit more flavour., After 8 to 10 minutes in the oven, the salmon should be just cooked, but still slightly pink and blushing in the middle. Take it out of the oven and put to one side to cool slightly. Meanwhile, get a large serving plate or platter. Roughly shred the little gems and mix together with the watercress, dress with a little extra virgin olive oil and scatter over the platter., Break the blushing salmon into nice big chunks and place them in and around the salad. Scatter over the cooked prawns, then spoon the Marie Rose dressing over everything. You can finish off the dish off by snipping over the salad cress. If you want to go for the old-school look, sprinkle a little paprika over the top. Serve with the remaining lemon (cut into wedges) and a glass of lovely cold white wine. Perfect!"

butternut squash into the soup is a little trick I saw in Sicily. It gives it good colour and sweetness., Finely chop the onion, celery, fennel, garlic and chilli. Heat the oil in a large pan, add the onion, celery, fennel, garlic and chilli and sweat gently until soft. Add the wine, tomatoes or passata, squash and stock and bring to the boil. Cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes. Season and gently break up the tomatoes., Roughly chop the salmon and halibut and add to the pan. Add the prawns or langoustine tails, cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until just cooked., Taste the soup and season it again with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, if necessary., Serve drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with the chopped parsley."

When the temperature has reached 180°C, or slightly lower (check your thermometer), and the smoke and flames have died down, you can start cooking. Always keep an eye on the fire and top up the heat source, if needed., Clean and wash the shellfish, pulling the beards off the mussels and throwing away any open ones., Peel the garlic and bash with a good pinch of sea salt in a pestle and mortar until creamy, then finely grate in the lemon zest. Add a good pinch of black pepper and pour in enough oil to make a dressing., Tip the shellfish into a large roasting tray and drizzle with the dressing. Toss everything together, then spread the shellfish out into an even layer., Halve the lemons, add them to the tray, then slide the tray into the hot oven and roast for 10 minutes or until all the shells have opened and the prawns and scallops are golden and cooked through. Keep an eye on them and rotate the tray for even cooking., Pick and chop the herb leaves and serve the shellfish straight away, scattered with chopped herbs, and with lots of napkins!"

This will make the prawns look nicer and taste better, as they will take on more flavour., Get a wok or pan very hot while you very finely slice your baby courgettes at an angle. Place these in a bowl and have all your ingredients ready to go, which is really important when you're stir-frying., To your hot pan, add the oil, prawns, lime zest and ginger. Stir-fry for around 2 minutes, until the prawns are lightly golden., Remove from the heat, and allow to cool for 30 seconds before adding your courgettes, lime juice, chilli and herbs. You can increase or decrease the quantity of chilli to your own taste. I prefer to use lots!, Season with soy sauce and toss well, then serve on a plate. Eat straight away, while the courgettes are still nice and crunchy."

I thought the combination of flavours was great, and very accessible to us back home in Britain. You can buy very high-quality frozen prawns in supermarkets these days (thaw before using), so it’s a win-win situation, but if you can get hold of some super-fresh ones and peel them yourself this can all of a sudden become very luxurious in flavour. A real crowd-pleaser. Finish off with good-quality olive oil and wild rocket full of flavour and you’ll be laughing. ”",699,24.3g,3.3g,5.5g,2.1g,33.5g,86.9g,4.2g,"455                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried spaghetti, 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves                                                                                                                                                                garlic, extra virgin olive oil, 1-2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    dried red chillies, 400                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                peeled raw prawns                                                                                                                                                                , from sustainable sources, ask your fishmonger, 1                                                                                                                                                                small wineglass                                                                                                                                                                white wine, 2                                                                                                                                                                heaped tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                sun-dried tomato purée                                                                                                                                                                , or 6 sun-dried tomatoes blitzed in a blender, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 2                                                                                                                                                                handfuls of                                                                                                                                                                rocket","Cook your spaghetti in a large pan of salted boiling water according to the packet instructions., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the garlic.

Add the white wine and tomato purée, and simmer for a couple of minutes., Grate the zest of the lemon and roughly chop the rocket. When the pasta is ready, drain it in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water., Toss the spaghetti with the sauce, squeeze in the lemon juice, add half the chopped rocket, adding a little of the reserved cooking water if you want to loosen the sauce a bit, and correct the seasoning with sea salt and black pepper., Divide between 4 plates and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest and the rest of the rocket leaves."

Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the vermicelli, and cook for slightly less time than it says on the packet. You want it to be al dente. Once ready, drain, rinse in coldwater and leave to cool. Put it into a large bowl and grate in your courgettes. Add the chopped tomatoes, coriander, preserved lemon, cumin, sweet paprika, ground ginger and 1 teaspoon of harissa. Mix it all together really well with your clean hands, then have a taste, add a pinch of salt and pepper if needed, and put aside., Place the fish on a large chopping board and score the skin every 2cm on both sides at a slight angle, using a sharp knife. Sprinkle over a little salt, a small pinch of cumin, and a pinch each of sweet paprika and ground ginger. Mix the remaining teaspoon of harissa with 1 teaspoon of olive oil and rub half of it into the fish, making sure it gets into the cuts you’ve made. Turn the fish over and repeat on the other side., Spoon two-thirds of your vermicelli filling into a large baking tray or earthenware-type dish, making a bed for the fish, and gently place the fish on top. Stir your prawns into the rest of the vermicelli filling and spoon this into the cavity of your fish, pushing it right in – don’t worry if it spills out a little. Drizzle over a little olive oil, and roast in the hot oven for around 25 minutes, until the fish is crisp on the outside and cooked through., To serve, pull the meat off and pick the bones out. Add a spoonful of the vermicelli filling on the side of each plate and serve with a crisp dressed green salad., PS Any leftover vermicelli will be delicious the next day as a cold salad."

If you want to, you can ask your fishmonger to run a knife down the back of the fish and make a pocket for you to stuff. If not, it’s dead easy to do at home. If you need some guidance, check out a video of how to stuff a flatfish. Once you’ve tried it this way you can stuff the fish with whatever you fancy: lobster or crabmeat, small fish, herbs, tomatoes . . . just let your imagination go wild! Getting a nice big fish isn’t hard, but you might want to order it in advance from your fishmonger. It’s equally delicious with individual portions though, so look at this as a principle as well as a recipe., Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. If you look at the head and the tail of your fish, more often than not there’s a secret line between them that the Big Man upstairs has drawn. Using this as your guide, carefully cut into one side of the line near the head, push down gently, angle the tip-end of your knife towards the bone and score between the flesh and the bone to peel away that beautiful fish fillet. Run the knife down to just above the tail and part the fillet from the bone – about 4 to 5cm deep on both sides. Even if you don’t get it perfect, you’ll be stuffing this pocket with prawns so no one will know if your knife work was a bit shabby., Get a roasting tray that snugly fits your fish and sprinkle your finely sliced onions around the base of the tray. Season both sides of your fish with sea salt and black pepper and lay it on top of the onions. Try to sweep most of the onions under the fish so they sweeten as they cook., Add a pinch of salt and pepper, the grated garlic and a pinch of cayenne to the olive oil, then grate over the zest of half your lemon. Toss the peeled prawns through this mixture until nicely coated, then stuff them loosely inside the fish, pouring over any flavoured oil left behind in the bowl. Before putting it into the oven drizzle over some olive oil and a splash of white wine, then halve your lemon and add both halves to the tray. Adjust the cooking time depending on the size of your fish: a large fish will want 25 minutes, 2 small fish about 12 minutes. You’ll know it’s beautifully cooked when the flesh flakes away from the bone., Finely chop your parsley leaves and sprinkle them over the fish once it’s out of the oven. Squeeze over the juices from your roasted lemon halves, and serve. I like to put this in the middle of the table with something propping up one end of the tray so that the delicious milky juices run out of the fish and mingle with the olive oil and lemon juices at one end of the tray. Spoon this over clumps of your fish and prawns, and anything else you’re serving it with, like new potatoes, mash or simple steamed greens – it will taste wonderful."

wedges","Heat a large wide-based pan over a medium heat and add a lug of olive oil, the sliced chorizo and the pork belly. Fry for around 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. As soon as the chorizo starts taking on colour and the fat is beginning to cook out of it, add the chopped peppers, garlic, onion and parsley stalks along with a good pinch of salt and pepper and the saffron. Fry gently for another 10 minutes, or until the vegetables have begun to soften. Meanwhile pick through the shellfish and get rid of any clams or mussels that aren't tightly closed., Add the rice and jarred peppers and keep stirring for a few minutes until the rice is coated in all the lovely flavours, then pour in the tinned tomatoes and 800ml of stock, seasoning again with salt and pepper. Bring everything to the boil, then turn down to a medium to low heat and stir constantly for about 15 minutes. This combination of flavours will be absolutely beautiful, but you’ve got to help the dish along by doing your job and making sure each grain of rice gets the same amount of love. So every now and then, stir from the outside of the pan into the middle so you get a sort of pile of rice in the centre, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom. Flatten the pile out with your spoon, then start the whole process again., After 15 minutes the rice should be cooked, but still have a bit of a bite, so add the mussels or clams and the prawns. You may want to add an extra splash of stock here if the rice looks a bit dry. Keep stirring, and as the clams and mussels start to open and the prawns begin to turn pink, add your squid and green beans and cook for a further 5 minutes or so. Discard any clams or mussels that don't open. Stir in the chopped parsley leaves and the juice from half your lemon wedges, and bring to the table with the remaining lemon wedges on the side and a crisp green salad."

   fresh curly parsley","Jambalaya is a French word that means ‘jumbled’ or ‘mixed up’, and I have no doubt that the philosophy and heart of this recipe come from a similar place to paella, kedgeree and risotto., Originally, any Louisiana ‘critter’ unlucky enough to get caught would have gone into this: rabbit, duck, squirrel, frog, alligator. . . you name it! And similarly, you can adapt it to whatever your local butcher or fishmonger happens to have. Go cheaper by using things like frozen prawns and chicken livers, or more expensive by including lobster or crab. I used an incredible local smoked sausage called andouille, but fresh chorizo or any other smoked sausage would work just as well., This dish makes me happy every time I eat it. And if more people than expected turn up for dinner just add a bit of extra rice., Season the chicken with sea salt, black pepper and a pinch of cayenne. Pour a couple of lugs of oil into a large casserole type pan and brown the chicken pieces and sliced sausage over a medium heat. After 5 minutes, once nicely browned on all sides, add your onion, peppers and celery as well as your bay, thyme and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir, then fry on a medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes stirring every now and again. It’s important to control the heat of the pan: you don’t want it to be so slow nothing’s happening, or so fast that things are catching and burning. You want a steady, solid heat., Once the veg have softened, add your garlic and chillies, stir around for a minute, then stir in the tinned tomatoes and chicken stock., Bring everything to the boil, then turn the heat down, pop the lid on the pan and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. When you can pull the meat off the bone and shred it easily the chicken’s ready. Feel free to remove the chicken bones at this point if you like, then add your rice. Give it all a good stir, then put the lid on. Give it a stir every few minutes, scraping the goodness off the bottom of the pan as you go. Let it cook for about 15 to 20 minutes until the rice is perfectly cooked. Stir in the prawns and if it needs it, add enough water to make it a kind of porridgey consistency (look at the picture). Pop the lid back on and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes while you chop your parsley. Stir the parsley through and serve on a lovely big platter. I absolutely love this with a lemony green salad."

destone and peel the avocados (or use a spoon to scoop out the flesh), then cut into quarters. Dress with olive oil, sea salt and black pepper, then add to the hot griddle pan for around 4 minutes, turning as you go., Toast the bread in and around the avocado pieces, flipping when charred to make beautiful croutons., Scatter the prawns and shrimps in and around the little cups – try and treat all the cups in roughly the same way if you can, then wind and drape over pieces of the smoked salmon., Transfer the hot avocado to the board, clank it up and divide it between the cups. Roughly dice the toasts into 1cm pieces, then sprinkle over the board., Add the passata, mayo, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, celery salt, juice from 1 lemon and the horseradish to a blender along with a splash of whisky, brandy or vodka., Add a pinch of salt and pepper, followed by a lug of extra virgin olive oil, then whiz together. Have a taste, and adjust the seasoning, if needed., Pour the dressing in and around the cups and finish with a wodge of dill and some classic old-school cress ripped over., Remove the yellow celery leaves from the centre of the celery heart (saving the sticks for another day), slice up the root, then cut off the upper yellow celery leaves and sprinkle these all over too., Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, dot the platter with wedges of lemon, and you’re done.

If you’re using wooden skewers, soak four of them in some cold water for 10 minutes, so they don't burn when you put them on the barbie later., Thread 5 prawns on to each skewer, making sure you poke through the fat and the thin part of each prawn., Slice the courgettes into ribbons with a speed-peeler or a mandolin (use the guard!)., To make the bay salt, crumble the bay leaves into a pestle and mortar, add 1 tablespoon of sea salt, then bash to a vibrant green salt., Sprinkle each prawn kebab with a good pinch of the bay salt, drizzle with a little olive oil, then pat and rub everything in., Place the skewers on the hot barbecue for a couple of minutes on each side. Fill the rest of the barbecue with the courgette slices – as they are so thin, they'll only need cooking on one side., After 2 minutes, turn over the skewers and cook for a further 2 minutes while you start taking off the courgettes., Pour 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil into a large bowl. Squeeze in the lemon juice and add the peas, broad beans and grilled courgettes., Pick and tear over the mint leaves and the chive flowers (if using). Season with a little salt and black pepper and gently mix together., Serve the vegetables in a big bowl in the middle of the table with the skewers on a wooden board next to it."

Smash the garlic and salt together in a pestle and mortar. Whisk together the egg yolk and mustard in a bowl, then start adding the olive oils, bit by bit., Once you’ve blended in 150ml, add the rest in larger amounts. Finally add the smashed garlic, then lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste., Lay your langoustines flat on a chopping board and, with a sharp knife, saw through their shells lengthways – cutting three-quarters, not all, of the way through. Open them out in a butterfly style and flatten them down gently with the heel of your hand., Season the langoustines and cook them, cut-side down, across the bars (so they don’t fall through) on a hot barbie for 2 minutes and then for 30 seconds on their backs before lifting them on to a serving plate., Sprinkle with torn fennel tops, if using, and serve with the lemony aïoli."
