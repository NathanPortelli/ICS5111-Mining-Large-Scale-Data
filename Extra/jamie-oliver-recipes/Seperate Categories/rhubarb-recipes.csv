100g of icing sugar into a large bowl., Chop 250g of unsalted butter into cubes, then, using your fingertips, gently work it into the flour and sugar until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs (or simply pulse in a food processor)., Beat 2 large eggs with 4 tablespoons of whole milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla bean paste, then add to the flour mixture and gently work it together until it forms a ball of dough., Divide the dough in half, cover each piece and pop into the fridge to rest for 30 minutes., Roll one of the pieces of pastry out into a round, about ½cm thick. Lightly grease a 24cm non-stick loose-bottomed tart tin with vegetable oil. Line the base and sides with the pastry. Prick the bottom with a fork, then place back in the fridge until needed., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Meanwhile, make the filling. Trim 1kg of rhubarb and peel and core 500g of eating apples, then chop into 3cm chunks and place into a large pan with 125g of golden caster sugar, and a splash of water. Simmer on a medium heat for 15 minutes, or until tender, then strain through a colander, catching the liquid in a bowl., Tip the strained liquid back into the pan and simmer over a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until thick and syrupy. Remove from the heat and leave to cool., Scrunch up a large piece of greaseproof paper, then unwrap it and use it to line your pastry case, pushing it right into the sides. Fill the case with rice or baking beans, and bake blind for 10 minutes., Carefully remove the rice or baking beads (save for another bake) and return to the oven for a further 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp., Pour 500ml of whole milk into a pan over a medium-low heat, whisk in 3 level tablespoons of custard powder, the remaining 35g of golden caster sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla bean paste. Whisk in a figure of 8 until the mixture becomes really thick, then pour into the pastry case and leave to cool., For your pie lid, roll the remaining pastry out into a circle, just under 1cm thick (it will be larger than you need, but the excess can be used for decorating)., Carefully spoon the apples and rhubarb over the custard base. Beat the remaining egg, then use it to eggwash the edges of the pie. Top with the pie lid, gently tuck in slightly, then roll over the top with your rolling pin to trim away the excess pastry., Use the excess pastry to decorate the top of your pie, however you like. Brush with a little more beaten egg to glaze, then toss 50g of flaked almonds in 1 teaspoon of icing sugar and a tiny splash of water, then sprinkle over the top., Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden.

Tip upside down to ensure everything is gently mixed., Store in a cool, dark place for 3 to 4 days, for the flavours to get to know each other. When it’s ready, strain the mixture back into the empty gin bottle.

Peel and smash in the garlic, muddle in 2 tablespoons each of oil and red wine vinegar, then season with black pepper., Rub the paste all over the pork, getting it into all the nooks and crannies, then cover and pop in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Place a large sheet of greaseproof paper on a flat surface and rub lightly with oil. Arrange the Coppa di Parma on the paper, slightly overlapping, to make a large square., Place the pork at one end and roll it up tightly in the Coppa, using the paper to help you. Carefully remove the paper and secure the pork all the way along with butcher’s string., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil and the butter, add the pork and brown all over, turning with tongs., Peel the onion and cut into eighths, and trim and roughly chop the celery, adding to the pan as you go. Strip in 2 sprigs of the rosemary, then pour in most of the wine and let it bubble and cook away for 1 minute., Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning and basting every 10 minutes, and adding the last of the Chianti towards the end., Meanwhile, scrub both celeriac, then carefully peel the knobbly skin with a sharp knife. Place the peelings in a roasting tray, toss with 1 tablespoon of oil and a little salt and pepper, then pop in the bottom of the oven with the pork., Chop the rest of the celeriac into rough 2cm chunks, then place in a large casserole pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Pick in the thyme leaves, then cook with the lid on for 30 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally and adding splashes of water, if needed., To make the compote, trim and chop the rhubarb into 5cm chunks and place in a roasting tray. Core the apples, cut into wedges and place in the tray, then add a pinch of pepper, the sugar, butter and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar. Drop in the remaining rosemary sprig, then place in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until you’re able to mash the fruit slightly., Remove the pork from the oven and let it rest in its juices while the fruit and celeriac finish cooking., Carve the pork (discard the string) and serve with the fruit compote, celeriac and crispy celeriac crackling, spooning over the pan juices. Delicious served with seasonal steamed greens."

Grease two 20cm springform cake tins and line the bases with greaseproof paper, then dust the sides with flour., Chop the butter into cubes, then beat with the caster sugar and vanilla until very pale and creamy., Beat in the eggs one by one, then sift in and fold through the flour and baking powder., Divide the batter between the prepared tins and spread out evenly. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden and an skewer inserted comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in the tins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely., Meanwhile, to make the jam, trim the rhubarb, chop into 3cm chunks and place in a large pan with the caster sugar and 2 tablespoons of water. Mix well., Place the pan over a medium heat with the lid ajar. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes., Remove the lid and simmer for a further 10 minutes, or until the rhubarb has broken down and is thick and jammy, stirring occasionally. Leave to cool., To make the custard, mix the custard powder, icing sugar and 1 splash of milk together in a pan. Whisk to a smooth paste, then pour in the remaining milk and whisk again until well combined., Place over a low heat and cook gently for 10 minutes, or until thick and silky smooth, whisking continuously., Take the custard pan off the heat and cover with a layer of non-PVC clingfilm, making sure it’s in contact with the custard – this will prevent a skin forming on the surface., To make the buttercream, chop the butter into cubes, place in the bowl of a stand mixer, and whisk for 2 minutes, or until creamy (or beat it by hand)., Sift the icing sugar into a bowl, then gradually add it to the mixer, a few spoonfuls at a time. When all the sugar has been added, whisk for a further 4 to 5 minutes, or until very pale and fluffy – it should resemble whipped cream., Add 1 small splash of water to the buttercream and fold through to loosen slightly, if needed. Spoon the buttercream into a piping bag with a 1.5cm plain round nozzle, or use a large sandwich bag (then snip off the corner)., Whisk the cooled custard to loosen, then scrape into another piping bag with a 1.5cm plain round nozzle, or use a sandwich bag., Slice the cooled cakes in half horizontally, using a serrated knife, reserving the prettiest cake half for the top., Place one cake half cut-side up, and spread over one third of the jam. Pipe small alternating blobs of custard and buttercream around the outside of the cake. Repeat, until the whole of the cake is covered. Do the same with the next two cake layers., Place the final cake half on top and dust with a little icing sugar to finish. Decorate with some edible flowers, banners, or cake toppers – whatever you like!"

Set aside to cool., Spoon into a blender and blitz to a purée. Squeeze in the juice of half the lime. Taste and add more sugar and lime if needed (it should have a subtle, not overpowering, flavour)., Churn in an ice cream maker for about 20 minutes, or until smooth and set. If you don’t have an ice cream maker, put the mixture in a tub and place in the freezer. Every hour give it a good stir. Repeat until your sorbet is frozen to the right consistency. Transfer to a nice dish and store in the freezer., To make the brittle, use vegetable oil to lightly grease a tray lined with baking paper., Mix the matcha powder with a little hot water, then top it up to 75ml. Pour into a small pan with the remaining caster sugar, and place on a medium-high heat., Bring it to the boil, but don’t stir – just gently swirl it. Simmer gently for 4 to 5 minutes, or until it turns a deep brownish-green colour (or the temperature reaches 150ºC on a sugar thermometer, the ’hard crack’ stage), then pour into the greased baking tray., Roughly chop and scatter on the pistachios and 1 teaspoon of sea salt, then leave to cool. Once set, break into pieces., To serve, let the sorbet stand at room temperature for about 10 minutes, then scoop into bowls and sprinkle with shards of the brittle."

roasting tin. Cover with cold water and place the fish kettle or tin over two hobs., Peel and roughly chop the onion and carrots, and trim the celery, then place in the water with the salmon. Add the bay leaves and the black and pink peppercorns, then cover with a lid or tin foil and bring to the boil., Once boiling, switch off the heat and allow the water and salmon to cool – it’ll take around 5 hours., To make the pickled red onions, peel and finely slice them, using a mandolin if you have one (use the guard!), then place in a small bowl. Add the red wine vinegar and a pinch of sea salt, scrunch together, then set aside to allow the onions to lightly pickle., To make the rhubarb sauce, trim the rhubarb and peel and core the apple, then chop into 2cm pieces., Place the fruit in a pan with the honey, bay and whole cloves, add a splash of vinegar and the orange juice, then bring to the boil and turn down to medium. Cover and leave to cook for about 30 minutes, or until the rhubarb has softened. Add a little extra honey to sweeten, if needed. Leave to cool., To make the mayonnaise, first make a tarragon oil. Pick the tarragon leaves into a blender, add 100ml of oil and blitz to a paste. Add the rest of the oil and blitz again, then strain through a piece of muslin into a jug., Place the egg yolks in a mixing bowl with the mustard and whisk well. Very slowly drip the tarragon oil into the egg yolk as you whisk; when you’ve added half of the oil, add 1 tablespoon of vinegar, then continue whisking in the oil (you might not need all of it). Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and black pepper., Carefully remove the salmon to a serving board and gently remove the skin. Break up the salmon flesh and arrange on a large platter, drizzling with a little oil, if you like., Pick the herb leaves over the onions and toss well., Serve the poached salmon with the pickled onions, rhubarb sauce and tarragon mayo on the side –  delicious with boiled new potatoes."

Allow to cool., Preheat the oven to 150°C/300°F/gas 2 and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper., Meanwhile, put the egg whites and sugar in a pan and gently heat, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves. Pour into a mixing bowl and whisk till you have soft peaks. Spoon onto the greaseproof paper in 8 mini pavlovas and bake for 40 to 45 minutes until crunchy on the outside and soft inside., For the vanilla cream, whisk all the ingredients until the cream has increased in volume and keeps its shape., Assemble the pavlova by dolloping the cream on the meringue, followed by some fruit. To finish, shave or grate over white chocolate."

Cut the rhubarb into 6cm pieces and place in an ovenproof dish along with the sugar. Add the zest and juice of both oranges, then cover with foil and roast in the oven for 15–20 minutes, or until softened – the cooking time may vary, depending on the thickness of your rhubarb. Taste it and add a little more sugar if you like., Transfer the rhubarb to a plate, set aside, and pour the roasting juices into a pan. Boil it for a few minutes until it forms a thick syrup, then set this aside too., To make the custard, pour the milk, cream and 4 tablespoons of the sugar into a pan. Split the vanilla pod in half and scrape out the seeds, adding both to the pan. Bring it to the boil over medium heat, stirring continuously, then remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly., Place the egg yolks in a large bowl and beat in the remaining sugar to combine. Remove the vanilla pod from the milk, then slowly whisk the warm milk mixture into the yolks. Return the custard to the pan and place over a low heat for a few minutes, stirring continuously, until it coats the back of a spoon. Sieve it into a clean bowl, cover the surface with a layer of clingfilm to stop it forming a skin, and set aside., Make the meringues by placing the egg whites in a clean bowl and beating them with an electric whisk until they form firm peaks. Continue whisking as you add the sugar, then turn up the mixer and whisk for about 7 minutes, or until they’re white and glossy., To poach the meringues, pour the milk into a wide, shallow saucepan over a medium heat and warm it through until it just begins to simmer. Float 3 or 4 heaped tablespoons of the meringue mixture on the hot milk, making sure they are well spaced out to allow them to expand. Cook for about 30 seconds, then turn over and cook for 30 seconds more, or until they’re firm., Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meringues to a plate lined with kitchen paper, to absorb any milk. Repeat with the remaining meringue mixture, discarding the milk once you’ve finished., Spoon the custard into serving bowls, top with the roasted rhubarb – stirring a little for a rippled effect, if you like – then finish by placing a meringue island on top. Drizzle with rhubarb syrup and serve right away."

If using rhubarb, peel the ginger and finely grate it into the pan. Add the sugar – I usually add 3 heaped teaspoons to rhubarb and 2 heaped teaspoons to any other fruit, but just taste as you go along and add more if you think it needs it (please be careful when tasting as it gets really hot). Add 2 tablespoons of water and cook on a medium heat with the lid on., Once the fruit has softened, remove the lid and let the liquid reduce – you want to end up with a fairly thick consistency., Serve over cereal, yoghurt, pancakes, granola, muesli or even with roast pork!"

Your mum will love them!, Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and line a muffin tray with muffin cases., In a large mixing bowl place the flour, baking powder, salt and 225g of the brown sugar. Mix, then make a well in the centre., Squeeze a few drops of lemon juice into the milk and set aside for a couple of minutes. Place the orange zest, half the stem ginger, the egg, 100g of melted butter and the milk mixture into the bowl and beat thoroughly. Fold in the chopped rhubarb. Spoon the mixture into the muffin cases, filling each one to the top., In a small bowl place the remaining 100g of brown sugar, the extra tablespoon of melted butter and the rest of the stem ginger. Mix until it looks like a crumble topping, then sprinkle over the muffins., Bake for 25 minutes so the sugar turns golden and crispy and the muffins are cooked through. Serve warm with custard or crème fraîche for a lovely pudding."
