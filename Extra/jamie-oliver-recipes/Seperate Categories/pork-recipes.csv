Spicy Sichuan pork noodles | Jamie Oliver Cookbook Club recipes,My pick of the chapter. It’s that good – and so quick!,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/152741907.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '2']",MINUTES COOK),"“This is how you get your spicy Chinese noodle fix – fast! I’ve turned the famous Sichuan stir-fried pork with green beans dish into hellishly tasty noodles. The simple three-ingredient sauce here is one of my little secrets. It’s got it all – great savoury flavour, some rounding sweetness, and you can make it as spicy as you want. The trick is to get your green beans nicely blistered in the pan and a good bit of caramelisation on your noodles.

Paired with a super-simple homemade chilli oil and gnarly pork, this is a proper treat without a takeaway price tag. ”",649,21.9g,4.1g,10.1g,1.0g,29.4g,89.4g,8.2g,"olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                bulb of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 4                                                                                                                                                                cm piece of                                                                                                                                                                ginger, 1                                                                                                                                                                teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                dried chilli flakes, 2                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                light soy sauce, red wine vinegar, 250                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                minced pork, 500                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                plain flour                                                                                                                                                                , plus extra for dusting, 1                                                                                                                                                                head of                                                                                                                                                                broccoli (375g), 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    small red onion, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                runny honey, 30                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                salted roasted peanuts","Peel and finely chop the garlic and ginger, then place half in a heat-proof dish with the dried chilli, and put the rest aside for later., Place a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat with 4 tablespoons of olive oil. As soon as the oil starts to shimmer, pour it into the heatproof bowl to make a fragrant oil. When the sizzling subsides, add the soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar, then leave to sit – the flavour will get better and better., Return the pan to a medium-low heat and add the pork, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Cook for 5 minutes stirring occasionally, until golden and crispy., To make the noodles, pile the flour into a mixing bowl and slowly add 300ml of water to bring it together into a dough. Knead for just a couple of minutes, or until soft, shiny and elastic. On a flour-dusted surface, use a rolling pin to roll out the pasta to about 2mm thick – don’t worry if it tears or looks wonky, this dough is very forgiving. Dust it well with flour, then loosely roll it up. Use a sharp knife to slice it at 2cm intervals, then toss it with your hands to separate the strands., Meanwhile, pop a large pan of salted water on to boil. Cut the broccoli into mouth-sized florets, cracking open any big ones (this will help with cooking time), then finely slice the stalk. Halve the onion, finely chop and use it in 2 ways – add ¾ to the pork now, and add the remaining to a bowl with a splash of vinegar and some salt to make a quick pickle to be used as a garnish., When the pork is golden, increase the heat to medium-high, and stir through the remaining ginger and garlic. Add the broccoli to the salted water and cook for 5 minutes, with the lid on, then remove with a slotted spoon., Return the salted water back to the boil. Add the noodles, give them a stir and cook with the lid on for 3 minutes., At the last minute, stir the honey through the pork (this will stop it burning) to give the meat sweetness and shine, then remove from the heat., When the noodles are cooked, drain and toss them with the broccoli and the flavoured oil and divide between plates. Pour over the pork juices and scatter over the crispy pork bits from a height. Bash up and sprinkle over the peanuts, scatter with the quick-pickled onions, and serve straight away."

Divide into 16 pieces, then wet your hands and roll into balls., Peel and quarter the onions, then click apart into petals. Deseed the peppers and tear or chop into 3cm chunks., Cut the skewers down to size, so they fit snugly in your pan. Take pride in evenly threading the onion, pepper and meatballs onto each skewer (finely chopping any veg offcuts), then rub the kebabs with 1 teaspoon of olive oil., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat, tip in the finely chopped veg, along with the lentils, 1 tin’s worth of water and the rice (100g). Cover and cook for 8 minutes, then stir in the spinach, cover, and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the rice is cooked., Meanwhile, place the kebabs in your largest non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat and cook for 12 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, sprinkling with most of the smoked paprika when there’s 2 minutes to go., Divide the lentils and rice between plates and top with the kebabs. Dollop over the yoghurt, add an extra pinch of smoked paprika and drizzle over a little paprika oil from the pan, to serve."

And with 2 of your 5-a-day per portion, it’s sure to become a firm family favourite.  ”",526,19.3g,6g,11.4g,0.9g,28.2g,63.7g,7g,"500                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                minced pork, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    large egg, 2                                                                                                                                                                heaped teaspoons                                                                                                                                                                dried oregano, 50                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Cheddar cheese, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                stale bread, olive oil, 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    carrots, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onion, 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red chillies, 2                                                                                                                                                                x 400g tins of                                                                                                                                                                chopped tomatoes, 1.5                                                                                                                                                                kg                                                                                                                                                                potatoes","Put the pork, egg and 1 heaped teaspoon of oregano into a bowl. Grate in half the Cheddar, then sprinkle the bread with water and add to the mix. Add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, use your hands to scrunch it all together well, then shape into a loaf (roughly 20cm long)., Place a large shallow casserole pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the meatloaf, turning until brown on all sides., Meanwhile, trim and slice the carrots at an angle into rough 1cm-thick chunks, adding to the pan as you go. Peel, roughly chop and add the onion and garlic. Halve the chillies lengthways and deseed, then add them to the party, along with the chopped tomatoes and remaining oregano. Season to perfection, cover, turn down the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the meatloaf is cooked through., Meanwhile, chop the potatoes into 2.5cm chunks and place in a large pan, then just cover with water, place a lid on top and cook for 10 minutes, or until cooked through. Drain, then mash well, stir in 2 tablespoons of oil and season to perfection., Once the time’s up on the meatloaf, remove the lid, grate over the remaining Cheddar, arrange the chilli halves on top, then cover again and cook for another 2 minutes, or until the cheese has melted., Remove the meatloaf to a board and slice up, mashing the chillies into the sauce for added heat, if you like. Divide the mash between warm plates, spoon over the sauce, and serve with a slice of meatloaf and an extra grating of Cheddar, if you like."

Cook in the oven for 30 minutes, then remove the tray from the oven and baste with the marinade. Return to the oven for another 30 minutes, then remove the foil, baste again with the marinade and return to the oven to cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes, or until the meat pulls away from the bone easily., Preheat your barbecue. Once hot, transfer the ribs on to the grill and cook over a medium-low heat for 5 to 10 minutes., Pile the ribs onto a board and serve with a crispy green salad and new potatoes."

full whack (240°C/475°F/gas 9)., Carefully score the pork skin with a sharp knife or scalpel., Place the bay leaves in a pestle and mortar with the sea salt and give it a good bashing. Add the coriander seeds, fennel seeds and peppercorns, then bash again until fine., Rub 2 tablespoons of the flavoured salt all over the pork, massaging it into all the nooks and crannies, saving the rest for another day. Brush away any excess., Clank up the onions into wedges and arrange them skin-side up in rows. Lay the pork directly over the onions, then roast for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the crackling is golden and super crunchy., Meanwhile, prepare the veg. Scrub the carrots and potatoes, trim the celery and fennel, then clank up into 2½cm chunks and place on a large baking tray. Pick over the rosemary leaves, then break up the garlic bulb and scatter over the cloves, leaving the skin on. Season with salt and pepper, then give it a good mix., Remove the pork from the oven and reduce the temperature to 150°C/300°F/gas 2., Using tongs, carefully lift the pork off the onions and place it  directly on the top bars of the oven. Position the tray of veg exactly underneath to catch the tasty juices. Cook the pork for a further 2 to 4 hours – after 2 hours, the meat will be soft and easy to carve, after 4 hours, the meat will be soft enough to ‘pull’. Toss the veg occasionally, turning to coat in the pork juices until caramelised and cooked to your liking, then remove. (Pop an empty tray under the pork to prevent the juices from making a mess in your oven.), To make the gravy, carefully drain the fat from the onions and reserve for another day. Place the tray on the hob over a medium heat, then pour in the cider and let it bubble away for a few minutes, scraping up all the sticky goodness from the base of the tray., Gradually stir in the flour, then pour in 1.5 litres of boiling water and stir on the heat for 15 minutes, or until thickened and reduced., When it’s time to dish up, arrange the veg on a serving platter with the pork and strain the gravy into a jug. Carve or pull the pork and plate it up with a little bit of everything. Delicious served with a simple watercress and apple salad, and a dollop of English mustard."

Sit the pork in a tray, sprinkle with the kosher salt and the sugar, drizzle over the soy, then rub all over.

Place in a snug-fitting roasting tray, cover with tin foil and roast for 4 hours, or until super-tender, reserving the fat from the tray., Meanwhile, make the Ramen noodles., For the apple soffritto, peel and very finely chop the onion, garlic, ginger and apple (discarding the core). Place in a pan with the oil on a low heat and fry gently for 45 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring regularly, then remove from the heat., For the shoyu tare, pour the sake and mirin into a pan and bring to the boil on a high heat. Leave to bubble away for 4 minutes, then reduce the heat to low, add the soy and apple soffritto, cook for an additional 5 minutes, then remove from the heat., When you’re getting ready to serve, make your broth: bring the stock and dashi to the boil in a large pan, then simmer over a medium heat for 5 minutes. Put a pan of water on to boil for the noodles, then thinly slice the pork., Get yourself six warm bowls. Spoon 1 tablespoon each of the shoyu tare and reserved pork fat into the bowls, then divide up the broth. Cook the noodles in the pan of boiling water for 45 seconds (or according to the packet instructions), then remove, shaking off any excess water., Divide between the bowls, using chopsticks to separate, if needed. Top each bowl with slices of pork and a halved marinated egg. Trim and finely slice the spring onions and chilli (deseed if you like), and scatter over the top to finish."

cloves of garlic. Cut the green part off the leeks (save for making stock or soup), then trim, wash and finely chop the white part. Peel the potatoes and chop into ½cm dice. Tie the thyme sprigs together., Melt half the butter in a large pan on a low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, then add the onions, garlic, celery, leeks, potatoes, bay leaves and thyme. Cover and sweat down for 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Add all the mince to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Turn the heat up to medium-high and cook for 10 more minutes, or until the mince is browned all over, stirring occasionally., Pour in the wine, let it bubble and boil away, then finely grate in half the nutmeg. Stir in the flour for 1 minute, then pour in the milk. Season with sea salt and black pepper, cover with a scrunched-up sheet of wet greaseproof paper and transfer to the oven for 2 hours, or until thickened and beautifully tender., At this stage, the ragù might look like it’s split a little, but this is actually what we’re looking for – the milk in the sauce creates amazing ricotta-like curds as it cooks., Meanwhile, place a large heatproof baking dish on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil and the remaining butter. Peel, finely chop and add the remaining garlic, along with the chilli flakes, nettles (leaves only – wear gloves to protect your hands while you prep) and spinach – you’ll need to work in batches. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened., Allow to cool, then finely chop and return to the dish, spreading evenly over the base. Once done, divide the ragù in two, freezing one half for another day, once cool., Carefully drain the liquid from the remaining ragù into a bowl through a coarse sieve. Return the ragù to the pan, fish out and discard the thyme stalks and bay, then grate in half the cheese and stir well., Turn the oven up to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Use a piping bag or teaspoon to stuff the cannelloni tubes with the ragù, then arrange on top of the greens. Pour the sieved liquid over the top and grate over the remaining cheese. Trim and finely slice the mushrooms and scatter over the cannelloni., Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, then bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. For added colour, flash the dish under the grill for 5 minutes. Importantly, let it stand for 30 minutes before serving. Delicious with a seasonal salad for added crunch."

peppercorns and bay leaves in a pestle and mortar and bash until fine (or whiz in a blender), then decant into a jar., Rub 2 tablespoons of the flavoured salt over the racks of ribs (save the rest for another day), then transfer to two baking trays and cover with tin foil., In a 25cm x 30cm high-sided tray, mix the BBQ sauce ingredients together. Place all three trays in the oven for 3 hours, with the sauce tray at the very bottom, uncovered – keep an eye on it and add a splash of water to loosen, if needed., When the time’s up, remove the trays from the oven, adding a splash of water to each of the rib trays to deglaze. Divide 300g of the sauce between the two rib trays (cool the rest and freeze for another day), turning the ribs with tongs to coat., Place the ribs directly on the bars of the oven, with the empty sauce tray directly below. Put a handful of whisky wood chips into a metal sieve and set them alight. Once smoking, put the sieve into a metal bowl, place at the very bottom of the oven and smoke the ribs for 30 minutes, or until sticky and caramelized., Meanwhile, scrub the potatoes, cook in a pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until tender, then drain and leave to cool slightly., Pick the dill, then finely chop with the chives and place in a large bowl. Finely slice the pickled onions, then core and finely matchstick the apple and pear. Add it all to the bowl with the yoghurt, mustard and warm potatoes, toss to coat, then season to perfection., Transfer the racks to a board and slice into portions or individual ribs, drizzling any juices from the tray over the top., Finely slice the radishes and sprinkle over the top, then serve with the potato salad (and some napkins!)."

Wrapping the fillet in a parcel of prosciutto not only protects it, but also seasons it to perfection as it cooks.

Cover the porcini with 300ml of boiling water and leave to rehydrate for 5 minutes., Peel and finely chop 2 of the garlic cloves, then place in a large frying pan on a high heat with a knob of the butter. Add the porcini and half the soaking liquor, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes, or until thick and syrupy., Squeeze in the lemon juice, stir in the remaining butter, and season to taste with sea salt and black pepper. Leave to cool slightly., Drizzle the beef with 1 tablespoon of oil and season with black pepper. Sear in a sturdy roasting tray over a medium heat on the hob until browned all over, then remove from the heat., Lay out the slices of prosciutto on a large piece of greaseproof paper, overlapping them slightly, making a sheet big enough to wrap around the fillet., Spread the mushroom mixture lengthways over one half of the prosciutto, then sit the beef on top. Carefully roll up, tuck in the ends, then discard the paper. Secure with butcher’s string., Squash the remaining unpeeled garlic cloves and put into the roasting tray with the herbs, then carefully place the beef on top. Cook in the oven for 25 minutes for rare, 30 to 35 minutes for medium, or 40 minutes for well done., When the time’s up, remove the meat to a board to rest for 5 minutes, pouring any juices back into the tray., Transfer the tray to a medium-high heat on the hob, pour in the wine and the remaining porcini soaking liquor (discarding just the last gritty bit) and simmer to your desired consistency, scraping up all the goodness from the bottom of the tray., Remove from the heat, and sieve before serving, if you like – I also like to whisk in an extra knob of butter for maximum silkiness., Carve up the beef and serve drizzled with the red wine sauce – delicious with celeriac and potato mash, and steamed greens."

place in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat with 6 tablespoons of oil, the butter and fennel seeds. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly, while you finely chop the chicken livers and herb leaves., Stir the livers into the pan, followed by the herbs and 50ml of wine. Roughly chop and add the dried fruit, along with the pine nuts. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat and leave to cool., Finely grate over the Parmesan. Toast the breadcrumbs and use your hands to mix them into the cool stuffing., Place the pork loin on a board, skin side down, open it out and push it down flat. Season generously with sea salt and black pepper, then pour over and massage in half the Vin Santo., Scatter over the stuffing, pour over the remaining Vin Santo, then roll up the pork, patting on and compacting the stuffing as you go., Sit it with the seam underneath and tie with butcher’s string to secure it, then score the skin and into the fat with your knife. Season generously and rub all over with oil., When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to full whack (240ºC/475ºF/gas 9)., Wash the carrots and place in a large roasting tray. Sit the porchetta on top, then pour in 500ml of water and the remaining 325ml of wine., Place in the hot oven for 30 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and leave to cook for 4 to 5 hours, or until the meat is really tender, basting now and again., Remove the porchetta to a board to rest for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place the roasting tray over a medium heat on the hob., Skim away most of the fat from the surface into a jar, cool, and place in the fridge for tasty cooking another day. Stir the flour into the tray, mashing the carrots and scraping up all those gnarly bits from the base., Pour in the stock, and simmer until the gravy is the consistency of your liking, stirring occasionally., Strain the gravy through a coarse sieve, pushing all the goodness through with the back of a spoon, then season to perfection., Carve up the beautiful porchetta, and serve it as you wish."

seconds, then drain in a colander and place in cold water. Peel away and discard the skins, then deseed the tomatoes and chop the flesh into 1cm chunks., Pick and finely chop the basil leaves, finely grate the lemon zest, then toss both with the tomatoes, a good splash of vinegar and a good pinch of sea salt., To start the sauce, peel and finely chop the onions. Melt the butter in a pan on a medium heat, add the onions and cook for 15 minutes, or until soft, stirring regularly., For the crêpes, melt the butter and let it cool a little while you pile the flour into a bowl with a pinch of salt. Make a well in the middle, whisk in the eggs, then gradually whisk in the milk and 70ml water until smooth. Stir in the melted butter, then leave to sit while you finish the sauce., Stir the flour into the onions to make a kind of roux, then gradually whisk in the milk until smooth. Stir in the mustard and a few scrapings of nutmeg, season, simmer for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat., Put a 26cm frying pan on a medium heat with a tiny knob of butter. Once melted, add just enough batter to coat the base of the pan, gently swirling to cover. Cook until lightly golden, then flip and cook on the other side., Repeat with the remaining batter, wiping out the pan with a ball of kitchen paper and adding a tiny knob of butter each time – you should end up with 6 crêpes., Meanwhile, grate and mix the cheeses, pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, and tear up the slices of ham., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., Get yourself a deep ovenproof pan, 26cm in diameter. Repeat layers of crêpe, sauce, tomato (leaving any juices behind in the bowl), ham, cheese and parsley until you’ve used up all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of just sauce and cheese., Bake on the bottom shelf of the oven for 40 minutes, or until golden and bubbling, resting for 10 minutes before serving., Delicious served with a mixed garden salad with a French dressing made with walnut oil, and I also like to shave some walnuts on a box grater over the top of the salad for added crunch."

on a medium-low heat and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally., Pick the herb leaves, finely chop half of them and add to the veg pan, saving the rest for later., Leave the veg to cool completely, then tear in the mozzarella and add the breadcrumbs, minced meat, mustard, eggs, and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Scrunch and mix well, then shape into a loaf., Make a space in the middle of the fennel tray and sit the meatloaf in the centre. Criss-cross the smoky bacon over the meatloaf, drizzle with a little oil, then cover the tray with tin foil., Roast for 30 minutes, then remove from the oven and discard the foil., Mix the chicken stock, jam and tomato purée together in a jug until smooth, then pour into the tray. Toss the reserved herbs with a little oil and scatter into the tray, then return to the oven for a final 45 minutes, or until cooked through., If the juices need thickening at this stage, simply put the tray on the hob to reduce for a few minutes, until they’re the consistency of your liking, skimming away any fat from the surface, if needed., Serve the meatloaf, sweet fennel and juices with mash and seasonal greens."

Peel and finely chop the shallot, then trim and thinly slice the spring onion. Place both the shallot and spring onion in a mixing bowl with the mince, white pepper, sugar, stock powder, and 1 tablespoon of oil. Beat well with a fork for 5 minutes to soften and bring air into the meat., Oil your hands, then pinch off a small amount of pork, roll it into a ball and pop it on a plate. Repeat with the remaining mixture, and set aside., Fill a large saucepan with 1 litre of water and set over a medium-high heat. Peel and finely chop the ginger, then add to the pan along with the stock cube, fish sauce, ½ a tablespoon of oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. When it comes to the boil, add the pork balls and cook for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, Trim and finely slice the remaining spring onion, chop the coriander into 1cm lengths and finely chop the chilli. Set aside for later., Chop the watercress into 10cm lengths, then add to the broth and cook for 1 minute, or until just wilted. Drop in the noodles and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring to break up., Divide the soup between bowls, scatter over the sliced spring onion, coriander and chilli, then serve immediately."

the marinade, place the ingredients in a large bowl with 2 tablespoons of water and a pinch of sea salt and white pepper. Mix to combine., Immerse the pork in the marinade, and set aside., Soak the shiitake mushrooms in a hot water for 30 minutes., To make the ma po sauce, soak the dried chillies in water to soften. Place the black beans in another bowl of water and leave to soak for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, prepare your ma po bean curd. Cut the curd into 2.5cm cubes and place in a bowl of hot water for 4 minutes. Drain and set aside., Return to the ma po sauce. Deseed, roughly chop and blend the red pepper in a food processor with a splash of water until it forms a purée., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok over a medium–high heat and deep-fry the peppercorns for 1 to 2 minutes, until fragrant., Drain the oil, grind the peppercorns in a pestle and mortar, then transfer to a bowl., Peel the garlic, then peel and dice the onion. Drain the softened chillies, then dice along with the fresh chillies., Using the pestle and mortar again, grind the garlic, shallot, onion and chillies until combined., Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in the wok until just smoking. Add the ground shallot mixture and stir-fry over a low heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until fragrant., Drain and stir in the soaked black beans, the ground bean paste and remaining oil, one spoonful at a time, and stir-fry until everything is combined., Add the oyster sauce, sugar, ½ tablespoon of salt and the puréed pepper, and stir-fry for another 5 minutes., Lastly, stir in the ground peppercorns. You won’t need all of this sauce – store what you don’t use in a sterilised jar., To prepare the pork, peel and very finely chop the garlic, then peel and finely grate the ginger. Drain the shiitake mushrooms, remove the stalks and roughly chop. Rinse and finely chop the preserved veg., Heat the oil in the wok and stir-fry the pork over a high heat for 4 minutes, or until about 80 per cent cooked., Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, ginger, mushroom, preserved veg, shaoxing wine, stock and 2 to 3 tablespoons of your ma po sauce. Cook, stirring, for 20 seconds., Add ¼ teaspoon of salt and all the bean curd ingredients apart from the cornflour, and simmer for 1–1½ minutes, until the curd has absorbed all the flavours., Combine the cornflour with 2 tablespoons of water to make a paste, then stir it into the pan until the sauce is slightly thickened., Transfer to a serving dish, finely slice and sprinkle over the spring onion, then serve with steamed rice."

Finely slice the chives., Heat 1 tablespoon of peanut oil in a wok over a medium heat. Add the dried shrimps and shallots and stir-fry until the shallots start to soften., Stir in the minced pork and stir-fry for about 1 minute, or until the pork starts to brown. Season with a pinch of white pepper and a pinch of sea salt, then take it off the heat. Set aside to cool., In a large bowl, mix the three flours together with 400ml water until completely combined. Set aside., Pour 900ml of cold water into a large pan, grate in the stock cube and add the grated turnip, sugar, ¼ teaspoon of white pepper and ½ teaspoon of salt., Bring to the boil, stirring continuously to prevent the ingredients from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Remove from the heat and stir in the pork mix., Quickly stir the flour and water mix into the turnip pan, as it will start to thicken immediately., Once combined, pour it into the foil containers and sit them in both layers of your steamer. Pop the lid on and set it over a medium–sized wok just less than half–filled with water, making sure that the base of the steamer doesn’t touch the water., Steam for 40 minutes over a high heat. Add more water to the wok during cooking if needed – just be careful the steam doesn’t burn you. You can test if the cakes are cooked by pressing the tops – if they feel firm and springy and your finger doesn’t sink in, then they’re cooked. If the cakes give slightly, leave them in the steamer for an extra 10 minutes or so. (You can also insert a skewer into the middle of the cakes and if it comes out clean then they’re cooked.), Allow the cakes to cool completely in the tins before gently tipping them out and slicing them into sections. Typically the cakes are served as 8cm squares, but for a party it’s also nice to slice them into smaller (4cm), bite-size cubes., Place a wok over a medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of peanut oil and stir-fry the cake cubes until all the sides are nicely brown and crispy. Transfer to a serving plate., In a small serving bowl, combine both chilli sauces. Serve the turnip cake cubes sprinkled with the finely chopped chives, with the chilli dipping sauce on the side."

Drain and rinse the bacon., Peel and dice the onions and carrots, trim and dice the leek, then separate and peel the garlic cloves., Heat a splash of oil in a large, heavy-based pan or casserole. Add the onion, carrot, leek, garlic and thyme and cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, until soft., Add the wine and collar of bacon, cover, and cook in the oven for 2 hours, or until a knife comes out clean when it pierces the meat., About 15 minutes before the bacon is done, start the nettle mash. Cube the potatoes, then place in a saucepan of cold salted water. Bring to the boil and cook for about 25 minutes, or until soft., Wearing rubber gloves, wash the nettles, then blanch in a pan of boiling water. Drain and finely chop., Rest the bacon in its juices for 20 minutes, then remove the layer of skin and fat. Discard the vegetables., Drain the potatoes, return to the pan, then add the nettles, butter, milk and cream. Mash well., For the herb crumb, pick and finely chop the parsley leaves, using as much as you like, then combine with the breadcrumbs and mustard., Spread on top of the meat, then slice. Serve with the nettle mash and some braised cabbage if you like."

 juice lemon","To make a rub, bash all the spices together with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper in a pestle and mortar till fine (or use a blender). Muddle in 2 tablespoons of olive oil., Trim the fat off the pork, then rub the spice mix over the pork and marinate for 1 hour., Light your barbecue and let it calm down. Make sure you’ve got your coals high on one side and low on the other for control., Grill the pork for 5 to 10 minutes, using tongs to turn it till charred all over. Fat will render out, so keep it moving to avoid any flames., Once it’s looking beautiful, move it to the cool side of the barbecue, cover with tin foil and cook for 45 to 60 minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes – you should get gnarly pork that’s beautifully cooked. Check it by cutting in half and looking, or use a meat thermometer and stop when it reaches 72ºC inside – you don’t want it pink but please don’t cook the hell out of it either., Meanwhile, for the sauce, mix all the ingredients together. Taste it, and tweak the flavours until it tastes right for you. Whatever vibe you’re going for, you want to go slightly too far as it will mellow when it cooks. You don’t have to, but it’s nice to put it on the heat for a couple of minutes to help it along., For the salad, pick and finely slice all the herbs. Scrub the beetroot and shred the cabbage. Finely slice the chillies (if using)., Add the herbs to a large serving bowl. Thinly slice your beets and apples (core and all), then finely slice into matchsticks (a food processor will do a fine job)., Put these in the bowl, along with the chilli (if using), and add a squeeze of lemon juice., Just before serving, pour on the extra virgin olive oil, squeeze over the rest of the lemon juice and add a good pinch of pepper. Toss it all together, then have a taste and season to perfection, if needed., Brush half the sauce all over the pork so it’s shiny and dark, and cook for the final few minutes till it sizzles., Put it back on the hot side if it needs help to get sticky, but don’t let it burn., Transfer to a nice board, drizzle over the rest of the sauce and carve at the table, to eat with your lovely salad."

Preheat your barbecue., Drizzle a little oil over the ribs, season with sea salt and black pepper and rub all over to coat., Make the marinade. Deseed and finely chop the chilli, peel and grate the ginger and garlic then place them all in a medium pan along with the apple juice, white wine vinegar, tomato ketchup, mustard, soy sauce and brown sugar., Whisk the ingredients together and place the pan over a medium heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened., Put the ribs in a large roasting pan, brush with the marinade and cover with foil., Cook in the oven for 1 hour 15 minutes, or until the meat pulls away from the bone easily. Baste the ribs with the marinade after 30 minutes. After 1 hour of cooking time remove the foil, baste and cook, uncovered, for the final 15 minutes, basting halfway through., Once your barbecue is hot, transfer the ribs to it. Cook over a medium-low heat for 5 to 10 minutes., Transfer the ribs to a board and cut them up. Serve with handfuls of rocket and watercress, if you like."

180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., To make the paste, peel and finely slice the fresh turmeric, then scrub and finely slice the galangal. Place in a dry frying pan for a few minutes, or until they start to release their oils, then turn the heat off., Peel and finely slice the shallots and garlic, then deseed and roughly chop all the chillies. Slice the nuts., Crush the peppercorns in a pestle and mortar, add all the other paste ingredients and a big pinch of sea salt, then bash and muddle everything together – work in batches, if you need to. Freeze half for another day., Reserving 2 tablespoons of the remaining paste for later, place the rest in a large roasting tray. Add the meat and massage in all those lovely flavours. Drizzle with olive oil, then cover with a sheet of wet greaseproof paper and a layer of tin foil., Cook in the oven for 2 hours, or until beautifully browned and gnarly, shaking the tray halfway and removing the greaseproof and foil for the final 30 minutes., Chop the Chinese long beans into 7cm chunks (if using), halve the squash across the middle, then roughly shred the cabbage. Remove the meat tray from the oven and place over a medium heat on the hob. Stir in the veg, lime leaves, reserved paste and coconut milk, and gently mix together., Bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the veg are tender. Season to perfection., Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the packet instructions, and prepare the sambal., Peel the shallots and finely slice with the chillies and lime leaves. Bash the lemongrass, remove and discard the outer layer, then finely slice. Mix it all in a small bowl with the lime juice and a drizzle of coconut oil, then season to perfection., Dish up the rice and curry, and serve the sambal on the side, with lime wedges for squeezing over."

Sprinkle over the bicarbonate of soda and paprika, and season., Crack in the egg and use your hands to scrunch everything together. Add as much of the sparkling water as you need to make a smooth, pliable mixture., Divide the meat into 10 to 12 pieces and roll each one into a sausage shape, about 10cm long and 2cm thick. Place the cevapi on an oiled baking tray, cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge until needed., For the ajvar, preheat the oven to 230ºC/450ºF/gas 8., Place the whole peppers and aubergines on a large roasting tray along with the unpeeled garlic bulb and roast in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the veg skins are blackened, turning halfway through., Place the charred peppers and aubergines in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave for 20 minutes, to steam off the skins. Once they’ve cooled slightly, pull off and discard the skins, seeds and stalks and chop the flesh on a board., Squeeze out the garlic from 6 of the roasted cloves and add it to the veg along with most of the parsley, then chop it all together (if you have much roasted garlic leftover, stir it into softened butter and store in the fridge – it’s great for garlic bread!)., Keep chopping everything together, season with sea salt and black pepper, squeeze over the juice of 1 of the lemons and drizzle over a good lug of oil. Adjust the seasoning to taste, then set aside., Finely chop the remaining parsley and tip into a bowl. Peel, finely chop and add the onion, squeeze over the juice from the remaining lemon, then mix together. Set aside., Just before you’re ready to serve, warm your flatbreads in the oven, and preheat a griddle pan over a high heat. Add the cevapi and griddle for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cooked through., Spread some ajvar on top of the warm flatbreads, with a couple of cevapi and a guindilla pepper (if using) on top of each, a dollop of sour cream and the herby onions on the side."

Deseed and finely slice the fresh chillies., Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large pan over a medium heat, add the onions, garlic, coriander stalks and most of the fresh chilli, then cook for 10 minutes, or until the onion is soft but not coloured., Peel and finely chop the carrots, add to the pan with the paprika, cinnamon and half the cumin seeds, and fry for a further 5 minutes., Reserving the soaking water, drain the rehydrated chillies, then finely chop and stir into the pan. Add the mince, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, then cook for 5 minutes, or until all the liquid has evaporated and the meat has browned., Add the reserved soaking water followed by the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Season with sea salt and black pepper, then bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and leave to tick away for 1 to 2 hours, or until thickened., Meanwhile, char the peppers by carefully holding them with tongs over a flame or placing under the grill, turning regularly until blackened all over. Place in a bowl, cover and leave to steam for 5 to 10 minutes., Discard the blackened skin and seeds from the charred peppers, then slice into strips and add to the chilli., With 5 minutes to go, toast the cumin seeds in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat for 2 minutes. Add a good drizzle of oil, drain and add the beans, then fry until crisp and starting to pop, tossing regularly. Season to taste, then tip into a serving bowl., Season the chilli to taste, remove the cinnamon stick, then scatter over the reserved fresh chilli, coriander leaves and popped beans. Delicious served with a dollop of yoghurt or soured cream."

Drizzle olive oil over everything and season well., Take a skewer, put a quail leg on first, then a wedge of pear, a bay leaf, a piece of sausage, bread, quail breast, garlic, and so on, in any order you fancy, until they are all stacked up. Try to put the quail legs and thighs at the end so they get more heat, and breasts in the middle and make sure you don’t jam things on so tightly that the heat can’t circulate., Halve the bacon rashers and wrap them around the skewers wherever you like., Cover the leafy skewer tops with tin foil to keep them from burning.

Drizzle the pan juices over each plate and dig in."

Simmer for 8 minutes. Drain, then cool the eggs in cold water. Peel and set aside., Crumble the haggis, then pick and finely chop the parsley. In a bowl, mix the sausage meat (if using sausages, squeeze the meat out of the skins), haggis and parsley, and season with sea salt and black pepper., Divide the mixture into 4 and flatten out on a clean surface, shaping them into ovals 12cm long and 7cm at the widest point. Wrap one completely around each egg, ensuring the outside is smooth., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4., Spread the flour over a tray, beat the remaining 2 eggs in a shallow dish with a splash of milk, and tip the breadcrumbs into a bowl., Dip each scotch egg in flour, egg wash, then roll in the crumbs to coat. Repeat with the egg wash and the breadcrumbs, so that each egg is thickly coated., Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pan until it reaches 180ºC. Deep-fry the scotch eggs for 2 minutes, or until golden., Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs to drain on kitchen paper. Pop on a baking tray and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the meat is cooked through. Cool and serve."

Squeeze between your hands to get rid of the excess liquid, then transfer to a separate bowl., Tip in the soft onions and mix together – the bread will cool the onions down quickly., Once completely cool, add the sausagemeat or squeeze the meat out of the chipolata skins into the bowl and use clean hands to scrunch it all together. This is your base stuffing mix and it’s delicious!, Or, you can embellish it with one or a combination of the ideas: 1 small handful of chopped dried fruit, such as cranberries, raisins, dates, dried apricots; 1 splash of sherry or sweet wine; 1 handful of pine nuts or chopped mixed nuts; the finely grated zest of 1 clementine or 1 small orange; a good grating of nutmeg., Rub the inside of a baking dish (20cm x 30cm) with butter., Reserve one handful (roughly 200g) of stuffing for your turkey, then push the rest into the dish, spreading it out fairly evenly., Use any extra herbs, nuts and dried fruits you have to decorate the top, pushing them in with your fingers. Drizzle with a little oil to help it crisp up, then pop in the fridge until you’re ready to cook., Bake at 180°C/350°F/gas 4 at the bottom of the oven so you get a really crispy base, for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through."

Rinse and drain the black beans., Heat the oil in a wok until smoking hot. Drain the pork strips (reserve the marinade) and add to the wok. Stir-fry for 1 minute, then stir in the garlic, chilli and ginger and continue cooking for 1 more minute., Throw in the greens, spring onions and black beans along with the reserved marinade, and continue to stir-fry over a very high heat for a few minutes, until the vegetables just begin to soften. Add a splash of water if it starts to stick., Serve your stir-fry on a bed of steamed or sticky rice, with an extra splash of soy sauce, if you like."

Roughly chop the ham., Melt the butter in a pan and sauté the leeks and shallot with half the thyme leaves for 5 minutes, until soft but not coloured – add a splash of water if it starts to stick. Set aside., Cut the broccoli stalks into 3cm lengths and slice the larger florets in half. Blanch in boiling salted water for about 3 minutes, then drain well., Lightly brush a 26cm round quiche tin with a little of the oil, then drape a layer of filo pastry over it, very gently pressing it into the corners, leaving a few centimetres overhanging., Brush the filo with a little more oil, scatter over some of the remaining thyme leaves and layer another piece of filo on top. Repeat layering the oil, thyme and filo until you have a fully lined quiche base – around 4 filo sheets. Bake the case in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes, until just starting to colour., Stir the broccoli and smoked ham through the leek mixture, then spoon the filling over the pastry base., Beat the eggs and milk with a pinch of black pepper, then grate in ¾ of the cheese. Pour it over the veg and ham, grate over the rest of the cheese, then place it on a baking tray and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cooked through., Remove from the oven and leave to stand for 15 minutes before serving with a green salad."

Peel and dice the onions, then peel and finely slice the garlic. Roughly chop the chicken livers, then pick and finely chop the rosemary and thyme. Soak the breadcrumbs in water., Sweat the onion and garlic in a good lug of oil in a frying pan for 5 minutes over a medium heat. Add the minced pork and chicken liver, and cook until the pork turns light golden brown. Throw in the chopped herbs and sage and cook for a further 5 minutes., Deglaze the pan with the vin santo, take off the heat and add the pine nuts and sultanas., Gently squeeze out the bread, allowing a little water to remain, add to the pan and bring it all together. Season and set aside to cool., Butterfly the pork belly like a book, rub with the 50ml of vin santo and some sea salt and black pepper, then pack two-thirds of the stuffing tightly over the entire surface., Close the belly, then add a final layer of the remaining stuffing and wrap it like a swiss roll, starting at the belly end., Next, tie up the meat using 10 lengths of butcher’s string, each about 30cm. Tie very tightly around the middle of the joint, then at either end, about 1cm from the edge. Keep going along the joint until you have used up all the string. The filling should be well wrapped – if any escapes from the sides, push it back in., Using your hands, massage 1 tablespoon of oil all over the joint, then rub with salt and pepper., Slice the carrots lengthways, then arrange like a trivet in a large roasting tin and place the joint on top. Pour over the white wine and roast for 30 minutes, then turn down the heat to 150ºC/gas 2 and roast for 3 hours., Remove the joint from the oven, drizzling some of the juices from the roasting tin all over it. Insert a fork at either side of the joint and lift onto a wooden board. Leave to rest while you make your gravy., Skim away the excess fat from the roasting pan and place it over a low-medium heat. Whisk in the flour and let it thicken for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly, then add the wine to loosen., After another 3 to 4 minutes, stir in the chicken stock and continue to cook for 10 minutes.

Cover with cold water and bring to the boil over 
a medium heat. Lower the heat, cover and simmer for 40 minutes, until tender (skip this step if using tinned beans, as they’re already cooked.), Preheat the oven to 220ºC/gas 7., Drain the beans in a colander, tip into a bowl and cover. Place the red peppers on a baking tray and roast for 30 minutes, or until tender and the skins have blackened., Remove from the oven and place in a sealable bag. Shake for a bit, then leave for 5 minutes or until the bag is filled with steam. Tip the peppers onto a wooden board and remove the skins and seeds with your fingers or a knife. Roughly chop the peppers and place in a bowl; set aside. Lower the oven to 200ºC/gas 6., Peel and finely chop the garlic cloves, pick and finely chop the parsley and roughly chop the kale., Using a pestle and mortar, pound the breadcrumbs, garlic, parsley and half of the paprika for a few minutes. Transfer to a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of oil and season generously., Arrange the jamón slices on a large wooden board so that they overlap, then place your cod in the middle., Spoon the breadcrumb mixture along the length of the cod on each side, then fold the meat slices over the top, creating a log-shaped parcel. Tie up tightly with string, tucking a bay leaf under each knot., Transfer to a lightly oiled baking tin and drizzle with a little olive oil. Roast for 30 minutes, or until the cod is cooked and the jamón is crisping up., Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the borlotti beans, peppers and kale. Season and add the rest of the paprika. Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 12 to 15 minutes, then transfer to a platter., Place the cod parcel on top and serve immediately, cutting the cod into thick slices with a sharp knife."

onions, then place in a frying pan with 1 tablespoon of oil and cook gently over a medium heat for 30 minutes, or until dark, sweet and sticky., Pick and finely chop the sage leaves, then roughly chop the bacon and add both to the pan after 10 minutes. Once cooked, add the onion mixture to a large bowl and leave to cool., Shred the turkey and add to the bowl, then finely grate over half the nutmeg. Add the remaining filling ingredients and mix together well., To make the pastry, place the flour into a large bowl. Put the dripping and 300ml of water in a small pan over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until melted. Bring to the boil, then stir straight into the flour. Leave until warm and pliable, but cool enough to handle., Knead the pastry until smooth, then cut off a quarter, wrap it in clingfilm and reserve for the top of your pie., Working quickly, while the dough is still pliable, press it evenly over the base and up the sides of a 23cm loose-bottomed cake tin, until it’s about 1cm thick, patching up any holes as you go – you may not need all of the pastry., Place the tin on a baking tray and fill the pastry case with the cooled filling, then roll out the reserved pastry and place it on top, pinching the edges to seal and create a crust. Gently press down the top of the pie to create a slight indent to hold the cranberry topping., Using the handle of a wooden spoon, carefully pierce a hole in the centre of the pie lid to allow the steam to escape, then bake the pie for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 160ºC/325ºF/gas 3 and cook for a further 2 hours 30 minutes., Carefully remove the pie from the oven, brush the top with beaten egg and pop it back in the oven for another 20 minutes, or until perfectly golden, then leave the pie to cool completely., To make the gravy, soak the gelatine in cold water for 5 minutes, then remove and squeeze out the excess water. In a pan, bring the stock almost to the boil, then remove from the heat and whisk in the gelatine. Leave to cool to room temperature., Using a small funnel, pour the gravy into the pie through the hole in the top, adding just a little at a time and allowing each addition to sink in before adding the next., To make the cranberry topping, place all the cranberries in a pan. Using a speed-peeler, strip in the orange zest, then squeeze in the all juice. Add the remaining topping ingredients, except for the sage, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thickened, stirring regularly., Taste and add a little extra sugar, if needed, then remove the cinnamon stick, cloves and orange peel. Leave to cool and thicken for 45 minutes, then spoon it on top of the pie. Place in the fridge overnight to set., Just before serving, pick the sage leaves, and fry over a medium-high heat until crispy, then scatter over the pie."

1 teaspoon of sea salt. Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Finely slice the carrots in a mandolin. Remove the pan from the heat, tip in the carrots and stir to coat. Leave to cool completely, then let pickle for at least 30 minutes., Heat 1 tablespoon of the groundnut oil in a wok until smoking hot. Add the minced pork, season with the white pepper and a pinch of salt, then toss until golden and starting to crisp., Finely slice the spring onions. Add 2 of the chopped spring onions to the pan with the red thai paste and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the stock, and turn down the heat, cooking for a further 20 minutes, or until the stock has evaporated and the pork is tender, cooked and starting to crisp up again., In a separate pan, heat the rest of the groundnut oil. Add the cube of bread; if it browns in 10 seconds, your oil is hot enough to start frying. Pick the basil leaves, discarding the stalks. In batches, fry the basil leaves for 3 seconds, until they’re translucent and crisp (careful of the hot oil, as it may spit). Remove the crispy leaves with a slotted spoon and leave aside to dry on kitchen paper., To serve, separate out and place the lettuce leaves on a serving plate, scatter over the pork, pickled carrots, reserved spring onion and the crispy basil leaves. Drizzle with a little of the carrots’ pickling liquid and serve immediately."

As the pork scratchings roast, they’ll release lots of fat – spoon this out every so often and set aside for roasting potatoes., After 20 minutes, turn down the oven to 160ºC/gas 3 and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the scratchings become hard and crispy., Line a plate with a double layer of kitchen paper, and spoon the scratchings out to drain., Serve warm or cold with a pint of bitter."

Add water from time to time to ensure that the meat is always covered., Soak the dried apricots in boiling water and set aside., Remove the hock or head from the water and leave to cool. Meanwhile, put the stock back on the heat and boil rapidly for about 20 minutes so that it reduces. Remove 1 litre of stock and, in a separate pan, dissolve the gelatine in this stock over low heat., Line a large terrine mould with clingfilm. Pick the meat from the head or hock – you need 400g meat torn into 2cm chunks., Thinly slice the apricots and dice the cooked pork or ham into 1cm cubes. Combine with the hock meat in a bowl, and add the parsley. Add half the mixture to the terrine mould, season and just cover with stock.

Boil hard for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Tip the contents of the pan into a blender and blitz until smooth. Rinse the pan, return to the heat and cook the rice according to the packet instructions., Steam the carrots in a colander above the rice for 20 minutes with a lid on, then remove them to a plate. Add the broccoli to the colander to steam for the last 5 minutes, then put aside and drain the rice., Meanwhile, season the pork all over with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, finely grate over a quarter of the nutmeg, then pick over the sage leaves and really press them into both sides of the pork., Put 1 tablespoon of oil into a large frying pan on a medium heat, then add the pork and steamed carrots. Cook the pork for 4 minutes on each side (depending on its thickness – use your instincts), or until golden and cooked through., Remove the pork to a board to rest for a few minutes. Reduce the heat to low, squeeze the orange juice over the carrots, shake the pan to coat them and pick up the sticky bits from the bottom, then leave until it becomes a natural syrupy glaze., Slice the pork and serve with the rice, broccoli and carrots. Swirl the yoghurt through half the apple sauce (keep the rest for another day) and serve on the side. Drizzle with any pan and resting juices, and tuck in."

Very finely slice the onion, pepper and half the Parma ham. Finely slice the chilli. Quarter the tomato, cut out the seeds and finely dice the flesh. Finely chop the parsley leaves., Put the finely sliced Parma ham into a large dry frying pan over a high heat and cook for 5 minutes, or until crispy. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain. Cook the taglierini in a large pan of boiling salted water until al dente. Meanwhile, return the frying pan to a medium-high heat with 3 tablespoons of oil. Add the onion, pepper and chilli and cook for a minute or so. Roughly slice the remaining Parma ham and add to the pan, stir in most of the parsley leaves and season lightly with salt and pepper., Reserving some of the cooking water, drain the taglierini and add to the sauce. Add the lemon juice, diced tomato and a good grating of Parmesan. Toss well over the heat until lovely and glossy, adding a splash of the cooking water to loosen, if needed. Divide between your plates, sprinkle over the crispy Parma ham and add an extra grating of Parmesan. Finish by sprinkling over the lemon zest and the rest of the chopped parsley."

                            , for grating","Strip and finely chop the rosemary leaves and finely chop the bacon., Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large casserole pan on a high heat. Once hot, add the rosemary and bacon and fry for 2 minutes, or until the bacon starts to crisp up, stirring regularly., Add all the minced meat, using a wooden spoon to break it up as you go. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for at least 10 minutes, or until all the liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally., Place the coarse grater attachment in your food processor (or you could use a box grater instead) and grate the Cheddar, then tip into a bowl., Replace the grater with the regular blade. Trim and halve the carrots, then add to the processor and blitz to roughly the same size as the mince. Peel and halve the onions, add them to the carrot and blitz again., Tip into the pan with the mince while you get on with blitzing and adding the celery. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the vegetables start to soften, stirring regularly., Next, add the tomato purée and plum tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon. Fill each of the tins with water and tip into the pan.
Give everything a good stir and reduce the heat to low. Leave to simmer around 2 hours, or until thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally., While that ticks away, make your white sauce. Trim, wash and finely slice the leeks, then add to a pan along with 2 tablespoons of oil and the bay leaves. Stir well and season with a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Reduce the heat to low and cook for 30 minutes, or until sweet and softened, adding splashes of water, if needed., Add the flour and stir well to coat, then gradually add the milk, stirring continuously. Turn the heat up to medium, bring to the boil, then reduce to low and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened, stirring regularly., Carefully transfer the sauce to the food processor and blitz until smooth and silky. Add half the grated cheese and finely grate over half the nutmeg and mix well. Season to taste., Once the ragù is ready, preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5., Season the ragù to taste, then transfer half into freezer bags, portioning up as appropriate for your family. Allow to cool to room temperature, then pop in the freezer for another day. It’s a good idea to freeze them flat so that you can reheat them quickly and easily. It’s also a good idea to label and date them to avoid a game of freezer roulette in a few weeks' time!, To build your lasagne, spoon a quarter of the ragù into a large deep ovenproof dish (roughly 25cm by 30cm) and spread it out evenly., Spoon over a quarter of the white sauce, then snap over some lasagne sheets, making sure they completely cover the sauce in one layer. Repeat this 3 times, finishing with a layer of white sauce., Sprinkle over the remaining cheese and bake the lasagne in the oven for 45 minutes or until golden and bubbling., Remove the lasagne from the oven and leave to sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Delicious served with a fresh green salad."

Place in a bowl with the pork, sesame oil, rice wine or sherry and soy sauce., Peel and finely grate in the ginger and garlic, season with a good pinch of white pepper, then mix well to combine. To check the seasoning, pinch off a little of the mixture and fry over a medium heat with a splash of oil. Taste and season again, if needed., To make the potstickers, lay the gyoza wrappers on a clean work surface and cover with a damp tea towel to stop them from drying out. Lightly dust a tray with cornflour and place a small bowl of water alongside it., Place 1 teaspoon of the filling onto the middle of a wrapper, brush the edges with a little water, then fold the wrapper in half over the filling into a half moon shape. Pinch and pleat the edges to seal, then place bottom-side down onto the flour-dusted tray. Repeat with the remaining ingredients – you should end up with 30 in total., Heat a good splash of oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat, then add the potstickers, bottom-side down, in a single layer (you’ll need to do this in batches). Reduce the heat to medium and fry for 2 minutes, or until the undersides are golden., Pour 1cm of water into the pan, bring to the boil, then cover and reduce to a medium-low heat. Simmer for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the liquid has almost evaporated (if it reduces too quickly, top up with a splash more water halfway through)., Remove the lid and fry for a further minute, or until the undersides are crisp. Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a small frying pan over a medium heat., Combine the dipping sauce ingredients, then serve with the potstickers and toasted seeds scattered on top."

Place a large frying pan over a high heat. Add the pork, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, and fry for 5 minutes, until golden. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool., In a large bowl, combine the prawns with ¼ teaspoon of salt and mix until tacky and binding together. Add the rest of the filling ingredients and the pork, and mix to combine. Set aside while you make the dumpling skins., In a separate bowl, mix the flour with 25g of the potato starch and 200ml of boiling water. Add the remaining potato starch and knead into a dough. Pull off 1 teaspoon of the dough, flatten it and, using a pastry knife or rolling pin, roll it on a lightly floured surface to form a circle, about 8cm in diameter., Put 1 teaspoon of filling in the middle of the circle. Fold it into a half-moon shape, pushing one side into small pleats as you press the edges together to seal – this creates the classic ‘har kau’ shape., To fold your dumplings into rabbits, gently press and elongate the sealed edge by about 2cm, then snip in half with scissors. Fold each side of them back and pinch so that they resemble bunny ears. Make two dimples in the front of the dumpling and add a black sesame seed or dab of food colouring into each one to make the eyes., Set a steamer basket over a pan of boiling water. Put each dumpling on a square of baking paper, pop in the steamer, cover with the lid and cook for 8 minutes. Serve with soy and chilli sauces for dipping."

                       lime, extra virgin olive oil","First, make the marinade. Peel and chop the onions and garlic., Heat a splash of oil in a pan over a high heat, then cook the onion and garlic for 10 minutes, or until softened and starting to colour., Meanwhile, soak the chipotle and ancho chillies in hot water. Pick the coriander leaves and set aside, then finely chop the stalks., Drain and chop the chillies, then add to the pan with the coriander stalks, cumin, paprika and thyme. Cook for 5 more minutes., Stir in the vinegar, tomato purée, brown sugar, orange zest and juice, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and 400ml of boiling water., Bring back to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, or until glossy and thick., Allow the mixture to cool, remove the thyme stalks, then blitz in a food processor until smooth., Place the pork in a snug-fitting roasting tray and pour the marinade over the top, submerging the pork. Marinate for 4 hours or preferably overnight., Preheat the oven to 220°C/450°F/gas 7., Remove the pork from the marinade, brushing off any excess, and transfer the mixture to a saucepan for later. Return the pork to the roasting dish and roast in the oven for 8 minutes, so it forms a lovely gnarly crust., Reduce the oven to 160°C/325°F/gas 2–3 and cook for 5 to 7 more minutes, or until the pork is tender and slightly pink in the middle., Cover the pork with tinfoil and set aside to rest for 10 minutes., Put the pan of marinade on the hob, adding in any juices from the pork. Let the mixture reduce over a medium-low heat for 10 minutes, or until sticky and delicious. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil for a glossy sauce., To make the rainbow salad, soak the corn for 10 minutes, then drain and cook in a pan of unsalted boiling water for 10 minutes. Remove and leave to cool., Finely shred and place the cabbage in a bowl with the vinegar and a pinch of salt, then scrunch it all together., Cut the cooled corn kernels from the husk, thinly slice the radishes, then peel the carrots into ribbons with a speed-peeler. Cut the lettuce into wedges. Add the veg to the cabbage mixture and toss well., Make the avocado salsa by scooping out and mashing the avocado flesh. Finely chop the chilli (deseed if you like) and spring onions, then roughly chop the reserved coriander leaves., Mix all the ingredients in a bowl with the lime zest and juice and enough oil to get a texture you like., Warm the tortillas in a dry frying pan or in a foil parcel in the oven at 170°C/340°F/gas 3 for 6 to 7 minutes., Slice the pork thinly, pile on a platter and drizzle over any juices. Serve with the warm tortillas, rainbow salad, salsa, reduced sauce and lime wedges."

the peppercorns. Crumble in the dried chillies and toast it all for 1 minute, or until smelling fantastic., Tip into a pestle and mortar and bash to a fine powder. Peel and roughly chop the ginger and garlic, pound into the mortar with the turmeric, then muddle in 1 tablespoon of oil and the vinegar., Using a sharp knife, chop the pork belly into rough 2cm chunks. Return the pan to a medium-high heat with the pork and season with a little sea salt. Fry for 15 minutes, or until golden all over., Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the onions. Once the pork is golden, add the curry leaves and three-quarters of the curry paste to the pan (save the rest for another day). Toss well, then add the onions and cook for a further 15 minutes, or until golden, stirring occasionally., Finely chop the fresh chillies, then stir into the pan with the tamarind paste and sugar. Transfer to the oven for around 25 minutes, or until darkened., Take the pan out of the oven and skim away any excess fat (store in an airtight jar in the fridge for epic roasties another day). Place the pan on a high heat, add 600ml of boiling water and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer., Place the charcoal and cinnamon stick over a direct flame on the hob, turning with tongs until the charcoal starts to smoke and turn white. Place both in a small heatproof bowl with the cloves, then sit the bowl directly in the middle of the vindaloo pan (like you see in the picture)., Drizzle over a drop of oil until the charcoal starts to smoke like incense. Carefully cover the pan with a double layer of tin foil and poke a hole in the top to allow the smoke to escape., Put the curry back in the oven and cook for around 20 minutes, or until the meat is tender; or, if you prefer it falling apart, cook it for 1 hour longer, topping up with water if it gets too dry., Remove the charcoal bowl before serving. I like to dish up with homemade naan breads, a simple baby gem salad and raita."

I remember when I first tried ribs like these – I was about 7 or 8 years old, having a family meal at our local Chinese restaurant, and I remember thinking wow – I’d never tried anything like that before. Bundled with other great dishes like noodles and stir-fried rice, it was beyond exciting. My face and hands were absolutely covered in sauce and that’s how you should be after tucking into these little beauties.

Place the ribs in the centre, drizzle them with oil and rub all over with the five-spice and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Seal into a tight parcel and pop onto a tray in the middle of the oven for 3 hours, or until just tender and cooked through., Meanwhile, for the glaze, peel and slice the onions and put them into a frying pan on a medium heat with a lug of oil and the star anise. Cook for 15 minutes, or until soft and starting to caramelise, stirring occasionally., Stir in the five-spice for 2 minutes, stir in the rest of the glaze ingredients and leave to bubble away for another 2 minutes, then turn off the heat and leave to cool a little., Fish out the star anise, transfer the mixture to a blender and blitz until smooth, loosening with a splash of water, if needed, then pass through a fine sieve so it’s super-super-smooth. Have a taste and season if required., Trim the spring onions and deseed the chillies, then finely slice both lengthways and put them into a bowl of ice-cold water so they curl up. For a laugh you can randomly score the radishes and pop them into the water for a bit of a naff 80s feel; otherwise, leave them whole or cut them into quarters., When the time’s up, transfer the ribs to the tray, discarding the foil, and turn the oven up to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Brush a good layer of glaze over the ribs and return them to the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, then I like to keep brushing on glaze and popping them back into the oven every minute after that for a few more minutes, to build up a really good layer of dark, sticky glaze., Serve the ribs with a bowl of any leftover glaze for dunking, and with the radishes, chillies and spring onions on the side., Jamie's Tip: This is definitely an opportunity to have a finger bowl on the side and a tea towel at the ready."

sauce eggs, boil the eggs for 5 minutes, then refresh in cold water and peel., Pour the soy sauce and 250ml of water into a small pan with the mirin and star anise. Peel, slice and add the ginger and garlic, then bring to the boil, remove from the heat, leave to cool and pour into a sandwich bag with the eggs., Squeeze out the air, seal, and pop into the fridge for 6 hours, then drain (this is important)., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., Put the chicken wings and pork bones into a large casserole pan. Bash and add the unpeeled ginger and garlic, then toss with a good drizzle of sesame oil., Put the pork skin on a baking tray and place both tray and casserole pan in the oven for around 40 minutes, or until the skin is perfectly crackled, then remove for garnish., This is also the perfect time to transfer the casserole pan to the hob, adding in the pork belly and miso. Cover with 3 litres of water, bring to the boil, then simmer gently on a low heat for around 3 hours, or until the pork belly is beautifully tender, skimming the surface occasionally., Lift the pork belly onto a tray and put aside, then sieve the broth and pour back into the pan. Return to the heat and reduce the liquid down to around 2.5 litres., While doing this, put a large colander over the pan and steam the spinach until it’s wilted. Let it cool, then squeeze out the excess moisture and divide into 8., In a separate pan, cook the noodles according to packet instructions, then drain and divide between 8 large warm bowls with the beansprouts and spinach., Slice and divide up the pork, then halve the eggs and place around the bowls. Trim the spring onions, finely slice with the chilli, and sprinkle between the bowls., Taste the broth and season with soy sauce, then ladle the steaming broth over everything., Tear over the seaweed and divide up the kimchee. Drizzle with chilli oil, then break over the crackling. Slurp away!"

seeds, paprika and 1 teaspoon each of sea salt and black pepper in a pestle and mortar., Carefully cut the squash in half lengthways, deseed, then chop into 4cm chunks. Toss with half the spice mixture and a drizzle of olive oil on a baking tray., Roast for 50 minutes, or until golden, then remove from the oven and reduce the temperature to 150°C/300°F/gas 2., Meanwhile, drizzle both cuts of meat with olive oil and rub with the remaining spice mixture, then place a large casserole pan (at least 30cm wide, 8cm deep) on a medium-high heat., Put the pork and brisket into the pan fat side down and brown on all sides for around 15 minutes in total. Remove both meats to a plate and reduce the heat under the pan to medium., Peel and roughly chop the onions and add to the fat in the pan. Fry for 10 minutes, or until lightly caramelized, stirring regularly., Add the balsamic and the porcini liquor (discarding just the last gritty bit). Roughly chop and add the porcini, followed by the beans (juice and all), then scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands., Return both meats to the pan, loosen with a splash of water if needed, then bring to the boil. Season, and sit a layer of wet greaseproof paper directly on the surface. Cover with tin foil and cook in the oven for 5 hours, or until the meat is tender., Prick the peppers and chillies, then blacken all over in a griddle pan or directly over the flame of a gas hob. Place in a bowl, cover and leave to cool, then peel and deseed them, keeping as much juice as you can for extra flavour. Roughly chop with half the coriander, and toss with a little salt and pepper., When the meat is tender, remove from the oven, break up the meat, then stir in the squash, peppers and chillies. Adjust the consistency with water, if needed, taste and season to perfection, and keep warm., To finish, make the salsa. Peel the onion, then finely chop with the apples and the remaining coriander. Dress with the cider vinegar and extra virgin olive oil and season to perfection., Serve the chilli with the salsa. Also good with bread or rice, and yoghurt."

simmer over a low heat for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow the seeds to steep for a few hours, then drain them in a colander, reserving the liquid., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Peel the onion, cut into 8 wedges and place in a small roasting tin with the garlic. Roast for 45 minutes or until soft. Transfer to a plate, allow to cool, then remove the garlic skins. Roughly chop the garlic and onion on a wooden board., Place the garlic and onion mixture in a food processor with the drained annatto, allspice, coriander seeds, cinnamon, cumin seeds, oregano, saffron, chilli powder and 1 tablespoon of sea salt, and blend to a rough paste., Squeeze in the lime juice and add the orange juice, cider vinegar and about 4 tablespoons of the reserved annatto liquid, then blend briefly again to combine. Transfer the mixture to a large nonreactive bowl., Place the pork chops in the marinade, cover with clingfilm and marinate for 3 to 4 hours or overnight in the refrigerator., Remove the pork chops from the fridge and bring to room temperature. Preheat a barbecue or cast-iron griddle pan to a medium heat. Cook the pork chops, turning once, for 6 to 10 minutes on each side depending on thickness, occasionally brushing on some more marinade during cooking. When done, move the pork chops to a board and leave them to rest for a couple of minutes., For the onion rings, place the flour and chilli powder in a large bowl, season well and mix to combine., Thinly slice the onions on a mandolin (use the guard). Very carefully heat the oil in a large saucepan to 180°C (always be alert when deep-frying). Place the onion slices, in batches, in the flour and coat well. Shake off the excess flour and carefully lower the onion slices into the oil. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, in batches, until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon, then drain on kitchen paper and keep them warm while you cook the remaining onions., Transfer the onion rings to a bowl and serve with the pork chops, whole or cut up."

the shallots and fry in the duck or goose fat on a low heat for 6 to 8 minutes, or until soft. Leave to cool., Cut the pork belly into 1cm cubes and halve the prunes. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Pick the thyme leaves until you have about a tablespoon and finely chop., In a bowl, mix all the ingredients for the filling except for the rabbit and season well. Cover with clingfilm and refrigerate until needed., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. For the pastry, mix the flour with 1 teaspoon of sea salt in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Melt the lard in a saucepan over a low heat, then pour in 200ml water and bring to the boil. Stir into the flour with a wooden spoon to form a smooth dough. Leave the pastry for 5 minutes if too hot to handle., Lightly grease a 20cm-wide, 10cm-deep pie ring and place it on a greaseproof paper-lined baking tray. Take two-thirds of the dough and roll into a circle large enough to line the pie ring and with excess to hang over the edges. Carefully press the pastry into the tin, allowing a little to hang over the edge, and fill any tears or breaks – this is important! Roll the remaining pastry into a circle for the lid., Lay half the filling mix in the pastry case, then lay the rabbit thighs on top, making sure there are no gaps. Season generously and fill the pie with the remaining filling. Brush the edges with the egg and cover with the pastry lid. Carefully crimp the edges to create a seal and trim the edge with a knife., Beat the egg and brush over the top of the pie, make a hole in the middle of the pastry lid and bake for 60 to 80 minutes., Remove the ring and brush the sides and top again with egg before baking for a further 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Once the pie is cold, refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours., For the jelly, soak the gelatine leaves in cold water until they soften and squeeze out any water. Heat about a third of the chicken stock in a saucepan and stir in the gelatine until it’s dissolved, then stir into the rest of the stock. Leave to cool, but do not let it set., Once the pie is cold, check around the pastry for any holes and fill them with softened butter so that the jelly doesn’t escape. Pour the stock into the round hole in the top of the pastry until the pie is filled. Cool in the fridge until the jelly is set."

Cover with the lid and allow to heat up like an outdoor oven – you want a temperature of around 160°C/320°F., To make your sauce, combine the BBQ sauce and ketchup with a few drops each of Tabasco and chilli sauce, then set aside. Finely dice the onion, pepper and carrot, then put into a large bowl with all the mince, the garlic, bay, Worcestershire sauce, breadcrumbs, salt and pepper. Beat the eggs and add to the mixture, then use your hands to scrunch and mix it all together. Grate in half the cheese (if using), and scrunch to combine., Remove the mixture to a clean work surface and shape into a rectangular loaf (roughly 25cm in length). Using the handle of a wooden spoon, make four diagonal indents (roughly 1cm deep) into the top of the loaf at 3cm intervals, then pour over half the sauce. Place the meatloaf on a big piece of tin foil or in an old roasting tray, then place on the middle of the barbecue. Cover with the lid and cook for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, or until cooked through. Grate and sprinkle over the remaining cheese (if using), and continue cooking for a minute or so with the lid on, until melted. Remove to a board to rest for around 10 minutes, then slice it up and serve drizzled with the remaining sauce. Cheers, Grandma!"

Pat the ribs dry with kitchen paper, then place in a tray and rub all over with the paste. Cover with cling film and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 6 hours, or preferably overnight., When you want to cook, remove the ribs from the fridge, shake off any excess marinade and allow to come up to room temperature. Meanwhile, set up your barbecue for the half and half technique (so half the base is covered in charcoal and the other side is empty) – you want a medium indirect heat. Place a drip tray inside the barbecue on the indirect side. Cover with the lid and allow to heat up like an outdoor oven – you want a temperature of around 180°C/350°F., Rip off just over an arm’s length of extra-strong tin foil, stack up the ribs in the centre and tightly wrap. Place the foil parcel over indirect heat on the barbecue, cover with the lid and cook for around 2 hours, or until the meat is tender and starts to fall away from the bone, remembering to replenish with hot coals every 45 minutes or so. Meanwhile, finely grate the ginger and garlic into a small pan on the hob. Add the rest of the BBQ sauce ingredients and 80ml of water. Simmer over a medium heat for around 20 minutes, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Season to taste and set aside., Remove the ribs from the foil and brush all over with the BBQ sauce and any cooking juices. Return to the indirect heat for another 30 to 40 minutes with the lid on, or until tender and golden, basting well every 10 minutes or so. Remove to a board to rest for 5 minutes, then carve.

Add the bay leaves and bash again, then muddle in a lug of oil to form a loose paste., Rub the paste all over the pork, making sure you get it into all the nooks and crannies., Peel and halve the onions, scatter into a large roasting tray and place the scored pork on top., Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, or until you have a lovely crisp crackling, then turn the oven down to 170°C/325ºF/gas 3. Slow-cook the leg for 3.5 hours, or until the meat is easily pulled apart., When the time's up, pick and dress the sage and rosemary leaves with oil and scatter them over the pork. Pop it back into the oven and cook until the herbs are crispy., Remove the leg to board, cover with tin foil and allow to rest while you make the gravy., Place the roasting tray on the hob over a medium heat, add the flour and stir it into the juices so you get a sticky paste. Slowly add a little water until you have a lovely rich sauce., Pour the contents of the tray into a jug or bowl and blitz to a sauce with a stick blender. Return to the pan, pick, finely chop and add the parsley, along with the mustard and stir well. Season to perfection, Serve the roast pork with the sauce."

Peel the onion and cut into wedges, then add to the pan with the peppercorns and bouquet garni., Add water until it comes halfway up the side of the pan. Cover the ham with foil (making a tent to allow steam to circulate). Bake for 1½ hours or until pink and cooked through, then remove from the oven and cool for 30 minutes, leaving it covered., While it’s still warm, you will need to carefully remove the skin, keeping the fat attached to the ham. With a sharp knife, score the ham by making diagonal cuts across the leg., To make the jerk seasoning, peel and chop the garlic and shallots, deseed and chop the scotch bonnets and finely chop the chives. Blend all the ingredients with a decent pinch of sea salt in a food processor until smooth., Rub the jerk seasoning all over the ham and scored fat, cover in clingfilm and pop in the fridge overnight, preferably 24 hours., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Combine the glaze ingredients in a bowl. Remove the ham from the fridge, scrape off the excess seasoning and bake for 1 hour., Remove from the oven, brush with the glaze, then continue cooking the ham for another 30 to 40 minutes, basting with the glaze every 10 minutes until crisp, golden and sticky."

Add the paprika and muddle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil., Score the pork all over in a criss-cross fashion with a clean Stanley knife at 1cm intervals, just going through the fat, not the meat. Rub with the bay oil, getting into all the scores., Peel and roughly chop the onions and sweet potato, peel and finely chop the garlic, halve the chillies, then place it all in a snug-fitting roasting tray or dish and sit the pork on top. Roast for 45 minutes., Take the tray out of the oven and remove the pork to a plate momentarily., Stir the vinegar and passata into the tray, half fill the empty passata jar with water, swirl it around and pour into the tray, then sit the pork back on top., Reduce the oven temperature to 170°C/325°F/gas 3 and roast for a further 1½ hours., Twenty minutes before the end, remove the pork from the oven and skim the fat from the surface into a small bowl., Strip in the rosemary leaves (discarding the stalks), toss to coat, then sprinkle over the pork belly and place back in the oven for the remaining time, or until the pork is golden and tender and the sauce is reduced (loosen with a splash of extra water at the end, if needed)., The crackling should have puffed up nicely, but, if it hasn’t (pork skin can sometimes be erratic), just pop it under a hot grill and watch it like a hawk until it’s perfect. Serve in the middle of the table with your chosen sides (see below), and tuck in."

Finely slice the pepper and half the onion, ideally in a food processor or on a mandolin (use the guard!), or by hand using good knife skills. Very finely slice the chilli by hand, then tip all these into a bowl with the cloves, vinegar and a really good pinch of salt. Gently scrunch together to make a pickle and leave to one side., Finely chop the remaining onion half and put it into a medium pan on a medium-low heat, ideally with a spoonful of leftover pork dripping, or a lug of oil, and the Cajun seasoning., Fry for 8 to 10 minutes, or until sweet and lightly golden, stirring occasionally, then tip in the beans (juice and all)., Bring to the boil, mash slightly, then season to perfection and leave on a low heat to simmer gently and thicken for a few minutes, but don’t let them dry out., Meanwhile, cut the pork and any leftover crackling (if using) into 1cm dice and put into a medium frying pan on a medium heat with a splash of oil. Sprinkle with the paprika and fry for 5 to 8 minutes, or until dark and gnarly., Warm the tacos according to packet instructions, and shred the lettuce., When you’re ready to go, load up the tacos with the shredded lettuce, black beans and the crispy pork and crackling. Squeeze the onion and pepper pickle to get rid of the excess salty liquid, then add a little handful to each taco, top with a dollop of yoghurt and tuck in."

cheese","Place the pork loin on a board, skin side down, and rub all over with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., To make the stuffing, peel and finely slice the onions, then pick and chop the sage leaves. Place a large pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and the butter, then add the onions, sage, pine nuts, fennel seeds and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until soft and lightly golden, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, place the raisins and Vin Santo in a bowl and set aside to soak. Slice the sourdough and toast until golden, then halve the garlic clove and rub the cut side all over the toast. Pick the rosemary leaves and finely chop with the toast., Roughly chop the livers and stir into the pan. Turn the heat up to medium-high, stir in the soaked raisins, Vin Santo and toast, then finely grate in the lemon zest. Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7., Once cool, use clean hands to scrunch the mixture together, then scatter over the pork. Hold the oysters curved side down on a chopping board, look for the hinge between the top and bottom shell, then poke an oyster knife into the crack and prise it open (it’s not always easy, so you’ll need to use force here – but please be careful!). Press the oysters into the filling, and drizzle over any juices., Finely grate over the Parmesan, then, starting with one of the shortest edges, roll up the pork, patting on and compacting the stuffing as you go. Tie six pieces of string along the rolled meat to secure it, with the seam underneath, then season well and drizzle with oil, rubbing it all over the skin – this will help you get delicious crackling., Put the pork into a large roasting tray and place in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and crackled., Meanwhile, halve the apples and carrots, then peel and quarter the onions. Remove the pork from the oven and carefully place the apples and veg underneath the pork in the tray, then return to the oven and reduce the temperature to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Cook for a further 4 to 5 hours, or until the meat is really tender, basting now and again., Remove the porchetta to a clean tray and leave to rest while you make the gravy. Place the roasting tray on a medium heat on the hob. Skim away most of the fat from the surface into a jar, cool, and place in the fridge for another day., Stir in the flour, scraping up all those gnarly bits from the bottom of the tray. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil for 5 minutes, or until thickened, stirring occasionally., Strain through a sieve, pushing through all the goodness with the back of a spoon. Remove the string from the porchetta and carve. Serve with the homemade gravy and all the trimmings."

    jalapeño chillies","To make the pizza dough, place the flour on a clean work surface or in a large bowl, make a well in the middle, then gradually pour in 750ml of lukewarm water, followed by the yeast, sugar, a pinch of salt and a lug of olive oil. Use a fork to mix in the flour from the sides, then bring it together with your hands to form a slightly sticky dough. Knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for around 5 minutes, or until soft and springy, then place in a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise for around 1 hour, or until doubled in size., Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium pan. Finely chop and add the garlic, tear in the basil leaves and add the plum tomatoes, then cook for 5 minutes, or until smelling and tasting fantastic. Using a hand blender, blitz the sauce until smooth, then season with salt and pepper and set aside., Bash the fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar, then add to a medium frying pan over a medium heat with a splash of olive oil, the pork mince and rosemary leaves. Fry for around 5 minutes, or until cooked through and crisp, stirring occasionally., Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7. Place a pizza stone in the oven to preheat. Divide the risen dough into 10 equal-sized balls, then roll out on a flour-dusted surface to roughly ½cm thick and 25cm in diameter. Grate and sprinkle over equal amounts of the mozzarella, making sure to leave a rough 2cm gap around the edges, then drizzle about 5 tablespoons of tomato sauce onto each – by adding the cheese first and the tomato second, you’ll stop the base from getting soggy., Scatter over the fennel-spiked pork, then finely slice and sprinkle over the chillies. Drizzle with olive oil, then carefully remove the pizza stone from the oven and place a few pizzas on top, depending on how many you can fit (you’ll need to do this in batches). Pop in the hot oven for around 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp, then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, slice up and serve as you go."

the jerk sauce, trim and roughly chop the spring onions, peel the garlic, deseed the chillies and place it all in a blender. Strip in the thyme leaves, then tear in the bay leaves, discarding the stalks. Add the remaining sauce ingredients and a splash of rum. Blitz until smooth, loosening with a little oil, if needed., Massage half the jerk sauce into the pork belly, then cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight., When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 150ºC/300ºF/gas 2., Place a large, wide, ovenproof pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Chop the pork into 5cm chunks and add to the pan with 3 bay leaves. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pork is golden all over and any liquid has bubbled and boiled away., Peel, finely slice and add the onions, then cook on a low heat for 10 minutes, or until soft and sticky. Turn the heat up to high, add a good splash of rum and allow to bubble away, then stir in the remaining jerk sauce and 250ml of water., Bring to the boil, then cover and cook in the oven for 3 to 4 hours, or until sticky and reduced and the meat is tender, adding a splash of water if it’s too dry. You want it nice and juicy, but it’s not a stew!, With around 25 minutes to go, peel the yams and chop into rough 2cm chunks. Parboil in a pan of boiling salted water for 10 minutes, then drain and allow to steam dry. Place in a large ovenproof frying pan on a medium-high heat with the butter, a good drizzle of oil and the remaining bay leaves. Fry for 10 minutes, or until golden., Meanwhile, remove the pork from the oven, cover and put aside, then turn the temperature up to 200ºC/400ºF/ gas 6., Transfer the yams to the oven for 15 minutes, or until crisp and cooked through., Make the dumplings by mixing the flour, cornmeal, a good pinch of sea salt and 250ml of cold water to form a sticky dough. Knead well on a flour dusted surface, then roll into a sausage shape and tear off golfball-sized pieces., Roll into balls, flatten slightly with your hands, then place in a pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until puffed up and cooked through, turning occasionally. Drain and serve with the jerk pork and crispy yams."

Take the pork out of the fridge and allow to come up to room temperature., Using a sharp knife, score both the pork fat and skin at 2cm intervals in a criss-cross pattern. Season both with a good pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, then rub over the fennel seeds and a drizzle of oil., Peel and finely slice the onions, then place into a large roasting tray (roughly 30cm x 40cm). Stir in the molasses, vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper, then place the pork loin on top., Put the tray on the middle shelf of the hot oven, then place the skin directly onto the top shelf – the fat will drip down onto the meat to make it even juicier. Cook, stirring halfway, for around 1 hour 20 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through, the crackling is golden and puffed up, and the onions are soft and sweet. Check on the crackling after about 1 hour – if it’s done, remove to a board., Meanwhile, shred the lettuce, finely slice the tomatoes, roughly chop the cucumber and pick the mint leaves., Remove the pork to a board to rest, then use a slotted spoon to transfer the dark jammy onions to a small bowl., Preheat a griddle pan over a high heat and start griddling the tortilla wraps until each one is bar-marked and warmed through, turning halfway., Snap the crackling into pieces, then carve up the pork and place all the elements onto a large board or serving platter., Halve the pomegranate, then hold one half in your palm cut-side down over the platter, then bash with the back of a spoon so the seeds tumble out., Cut the lemons in half and drain the pickled chillies., Serve the platter with the tortillas, yoghurt, lemon wedges and pickled chillies on the side, then let everyone build their own beautiful kebab."

has become a classic New York dish, and rightly so. I love it when it’s layered up like this, with the tomato sauce and cheese, then baked in the oven to gratinate. Feel free to swap veal for pork leg or even chicken that’s been battered out. If you want to spike this with a bit of extra flavour you could also add a few capers or olives to the tomato sauce., Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Pick the leaves off the sprigs of basil and put them into a small bowl of water to keep them fresh. Finely chop the tender stalks. Put a pan on a medium heat and add a splash of olive oil, the chopped basil stalks, garlic and anchovies and cook for a few minutes. Prick the chilli a few times and add it to the pan. Allow everything to sizzle for a minute or so, then pour in the tinned tomatoes. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer for 20 minutes. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper., Meanwhile, prepare your escalopes. Mix the breadcrumbs in a bowl with the thyme leaves and Parmesan. Finely grate your lemon zest into the breadcrumbs, mix again, then lay out three plates in front of you. Put the flour on one and season it with salt and pepper, pour the eggs on to the next plate and put the herby breadcrumbs on the third. Dip the escalopes, one at a time, into the flour until well coated. Shake off any excess, then dip into the egg. Let the extra egg drip off, then lay the escalope in the breadcrumb mixture. Sprinkle a handful of crumbs over the top and press them down. Make a real point of getting breadcrumbs on to every part of the escalope., Heat a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a good splash of olive oil. Let it heat up a bit, then add your escalopes. If your pan isn't big enough, you may have to cook them in batches, adding a little extra oil if needed. Cook for a few minutes on each side until lightly golden, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain. Get yourself a snug-fitting, appropriately sized baking dish (approx. 30 x 20cm) and spread the tomato sauce in the dish. Lay your escalopes on top, side by side. Tear the buffalo mozzarella into pieces and dot these over the dish with a few basil leaves., Bake in the oven for 20 minutes until golden, bubbling and deliciously cooked. Sprinkle the rest of the basil leaves over. Perfect with a crunchy zingy salad, but in America they’d also serve it with things like spaghetti, rice or mashed potatoes, polenta or crusty bread."

Pour in your grits or cornmeal and cook according to the packet instructions. If you’re using polenta, check the packet to make sure the ratio of water to polenta is the same. Be sure to stand over the pan and stir constantly to make sure there are no lumps and it doesn’t catch. When your grits are ready, add the butter and grated cheese, and stir and beat in really well. Have a taste and add some seasoning to the point where it’s delicious. Pop the lid on the pan to keep the grits warm while you crack on., PRAWN & SAUSAGE TOPPING Get a large frying pan on a medium heat. Squeeze the sausages out of their skins bit by bit and roll the meat into little 2cm balls. Don’t go getting fancy, just pack them into roundish shapes. Once you’ve done that with all your sausages, turn the heat up under the pan and add the meatballs to the pan with a few lugs of olive oil., Shake the pan every now and then, and after 4 or 5 minutes the meatballs should be looking gorgeous all over. Add your prawns and chopped garlic and sprinkle in your smoked paprika. Give everything a good shake and within about 2 minutes the prawns will be perfectly cooked, so add a knob of butter and cook for another minute or two, shaking and stirring every 10 seconds or so. Take the pan off the heat, squeeze in the juice of your lemon, add your chopped parsley and season to taste with a pinch of salt and pepper., TO SERVE Let everything mix together, and stir around to pick up any flavours from the bottom of the pan. Have a taste and check you’re happy with it. Stir a splash of boiling water into your grits to bring them back to life, and divide between your plates. Spoon over the lovely meat and prawns, drizzle over any leftover juices and serve right away. So easy!"

                higher-welfare pancetta","Until recently, I’d always seen this type of pizza as a slightly greedy way of bulking out crusts and toppings. I hadn’t realized Italian immigrants had cleverly adapted their old-world recipes to suit new-world coalfired ovens. Making pizzas in tins to protect the base from the soot of the oven makes perfect sense to me now, and I can honestly say that when it’s cooked and seasoned with proper love and care, I’m more than happy with this representative of the pizza family., To make your dough, pour 650ml of lukewarm water into a large bowl and use a fork to stir in the yeast, sugar and 1 level teaspoon of fine sea salt. Add your flour, bit by bit, until it comes together. You want smooth springy dough, so keep adding a bit more flour if necessary. Dust a clean surface with flour, then knead the dough with your hands. When you’re happy with the consistency, pop it into a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm room until the dough has almost doubled in size., Meanwhile, put a lug of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat. Add your sliced onions and thyme leaves and cook for 15 minutes, or until softened and golden. Take the pan off the heat and put aside. Put all the tomato sauce ingredients into a food processor or liquidizer with a good pinch of salt and black pepper and blitz to a purée. Have a taste and season carefully, adding a bit more salt and pepper if it needs it., Slit the sausages open and squeeze the meat into a bowl. Bash up the dried chilli and fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar, add these to the meat with the dried oregano and mix well with a fork., Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Divide the dough in half and oil 2 trays (about 25 x 35cm) with olive oil. Use a rolling pin or clean hands to flatten and stretch the dough out. Roll or push the dough around each tray and really push it into the corners so you get a chubby crust and a base about 1cm thick., Divide your blitzed tomato sauce between the pizzas and spread around. Scatter over the caramelized onions and dot small pinches of the sausage mixture around the top of each pizza. Tear up the mozzarella and dot the pieces over the sausage, then sprinkle over the fresh basil leaves, sliced fresh chilli, a good pinch of salt and pepper and the grated Parmesan. Finally let your slices of pancetta sort of fall on to the pizzas so they curl and crisp up as they cook. Place in the bottom of the oven for about 20 minutes so the base gets nice and crispy while the top is cooking. Once your pizzas are beautifully cooked, serve right away with a fresh green lemony salad."

trim, peel and finely chop the onions, garlic, carrots and celery, then clean and roughly chop the mushrooms., Pick the thyme and basil leaves, finely chopping the basil stalks, then finely slice the bacon., Heat a good lug of oil in a large casserole pan over a medium heat, add the bacon and fry until golden, then add the onions, garlic, carrots, celery, mushrooms and thyme and cook for around 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly coloured, stirring regularly., Add the minced meat, tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, and 1 tin’s worth of of water., Pour in the wine, then add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper and the basil stalks. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer with a lid ajar for around 1 hour, stirring occasionally., When the time’s up, remove the lid, turn the heat to high and cook for a further 20 to 30 minutes, or until thickened and reduced, stirring regularly and adding splashes of water, if needed., Meanwhile, fill a large pan with boiling salted water, add a drizzle of oil, then blanch your pasta sheets for 3 to 4 minutes – it’s best to cook them in batches. Drain, then carefully pat dry with kitchen paper and put aside until needed., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6., For the white sauce, peel and finely slice the onion, then place in a pan over a medium heat with the milk, parsley, a few scrapings of nutmeg and the peppercorns. Gently bring to the boil, then strain into a jug., Melt the butter in pan over a medium-low heat, then mix in the flour adding and stirring in 1 splash of milk at a time until you have a smooth white sauce. Bring to the boil, then simmer for a couple of minutes before removing from the heat. Finely grate and stir through most of the Parmesan, then season to taste., When the time’s up, remove the Bolognese from the heat, tear in and stir through the basil leaves and season to taste, if needed., To assemble the lasagne, spoon a third of the Bolognese into the bottom of an ovenproof dish (25cm x 30cm), then follow with a layer of lasagne sheets and a third of your white sauce. Add another layer of Bolognese and repeat the process twice more, finishing with a layer of white sauce., Finely grate over the remaining Parmesan, drizzle with oil, cover loosely with tin foil and place in the oven for 20 minutes., Remove the tin foil and cook for a further 30 minutes on the grill/fan setting (at the same temperature), or until golden brown and bubbling at the edges. Delicious served with a seasonal green salad."

The chillies add great depth of flavour to the sauce, but if your kids won’t eat them, simply leave them out. ”",572,14.9g,5.4g,13.3g,1.1g,31.8g,82.2g,4.6g,"3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    carrots, olive oil, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                stale bread, 500                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                minced pork, 2                                                                                                                                                                heaped teaspoons                                                                                                                                                                dried oregano, 30                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                feta cheese, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    large egg, 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    fresh red chillies, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    onion, 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 1 x 700                                                                                                                                                                ml jar of                                                                                                                                                                passata, 30                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                Cheddar cheese, 480                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                dried spaghetti","Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6., Peel the carrots, quarter lengthways, then place in a roasting tray (roughly 25cm x 30cm), drizzle with oil and cook for 10 minutes., Meanwhile, blitz the bread into breadcrumbs in a food processor, then use your hands to mix in a bowl with the pork, half the oregano, the crumbled feta (it’s a small amount, but it makes all the difference!), the egg and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Shape into a loaf (roughly 20cm long), then, when the time’s up on the carrots, make a space in the middle of the tray and add the meatloaf. Cook for a further 25 minutes, or until the meatloaf is golden and cooked through., Meanwhile, halve the chillies lengthways and deseed, then put them into a medium pan on a low heat with a lug of oil for 2 minutes while you peel and finely chop the onion and garlic., Scoop out and reserve the chillies, then put the onion and garlic into the pan with the remaining oregano and fry for about 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly., Pour in the passata, add a splash of water to the empty jar, swirl it around and pour into the pan, season to perfection, then simmer until the time’s up on the meatloaf., Remove the tray from the oven and carefully pour the sauce around the meatloaf. Pull the carrots to the top of the sauce and arrange around the meatloaf with the chillies, then grate the Cheddar on top of it (I like to sprinkle over a few fresh woody herb leaves like rosemary at this point, if I’ve got it)., Pop the meatloaf back into the oven for a further 5 to 10 minutes, or until golden and delicious, and the sauce is bubbling., Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain., Serve everything in the middle of the table with a salad, then slice up the meatloaf, mashing the chillies into the sauce for added heat, if you like."

or chicken stock","Cook the potatoes and mixed veg in a pan of boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes. When they’re cooked right through, drain and put to one side., Heat a glug of olive oil and half the butter in a large frying pan and add the chestnuts. When they start to sizzle, add your potatoes and veg. Mash the veg up in the pan, then pat the mixture into a thick pancake shape., Fry on a medium heat for about half an hour, checking it every 5 minutes. When the bottom turns golden, flip it over bit by bit and mash it back into itself. Pat it out flat again and continue cooking until really crisp all over., Preheat the oven and a roasting tray to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7., Unravel the pork sausage links and squeeze the filling between them until all 6 sausages are joined together. Do the same to your venison or beef sausages. Pat them to flatten them a bit., Drizzle with olive oil and massage this into your 2 long sausages. Sprinkle over a pinch of pepper, the rosemary and some nutmeg., Put one sausage on top of the other and roll them up like a liquorice wheel! Poke two skewers through, in a cross shape, to hold the sausages together., Take the preheated tray from the oven. Drizzle in some olive oil and add the onions. Season, add the remaining butter and stir. Place the sausage wheel on the onions and stick the bay leaves between the sausages. Drizzle with some more oil and roast in the preheated oven for around 40 minutes, or until
golden and crisp., When your sausages and onions are done, your bubble  and squeak should be ready too. If it still hasn't browned, put it under a hot grill for 5 minutes., Remove the sausages to a plate and place the tray with the onions on the hob. Whack the heat up to full and stir in the flour, balsamic vinegar and stock. Bring to the boil and leave to thicken to a nice gravy consistency, stirring every now and then, and season to taste., Remove the skewers from the sausages and cut the sausages into wedges. Serve the bubble and squeak with a good portion of sausage, a spoonful of onion gravy and perhaps some lovely dressed watercress."

                                   milk","This is a bit of a special weekend dinner and, despite how impressive the stuffed pork looks, it’s honestly not that hard to make. It’s an exciting dish and the end result will definitely blow you away, but you’ll have to take a bit of time with it and show it some love., You’ll want to buy the pork from a good butcher and ask for a boneless loin of pork with the skin off (but keep it for crackling) and belly on. Keeping the belly on makes stuffing the pork much easier. A nice little tip is to ask your butcher to give you the bones, as these will make a brilliant trivet to roast your meat on., Preheat your oven to its highest setting. Tear or roughly chop your mushrooms – thick, thin and wonky, it doesn’t matter, you want it chunky and rustic. Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat, add a lug of olive oil, the thyme leaves and mushrooms, and toss around a bit. Next, add the sliced garlic and knob of butter. Fry everything off for about 10 minutes until the mushrooms are browning a little around the edges. Add the lemon zest with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then remove to a bowl and let it cool. Once cool, add the bread and toss together., Now turn your attention to the pork. Lay the loin and belly on a board, fatty-side down, and use a knife to make a little pocket between the loin and the belly meat. Stuff the cooled mushroom mixture into the pocket, then season well all over with salt and pepper. If you’ve got any garlicky, thyme and lemon juices left in the pan, pour these over the pork for some wonderful added flavour. Rub all the seasoning and juices into the pork., Roll the belly around the loin and tie it tightly with 5 or 6 pieces of string to keep it all in place. If your butcher gave you the bones, scatter them around the bottom of an appropriately sized roasting tray – you want the pork to sit quite snugly in the tray - and put the meat on top. Place in the oven and immediately turn it down to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 so the meat cooks through nice and evenly. This is a good time to get the crackling ready for the oven, so score the skin with a small sharp knife to open it up for seasoning. Bash up the fennel seeds and salt in a pestle and mortar, rub a generous amount of this into the skin and place it on a baking tray., After the meat has had an hour in the oven, take it out and add the chopped vegetables and remaining bulb of garlic to the tray, roughly broken apart into unpeeled cloves. Pour in the glass of cider and give the tray a shake to coat everything. Put it all back in the oven to cook for another hour. The crackling can also go in at this point., Before the second hour is up, put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Peel and cut the celeriac and potatoes into even-sized chunks, then boil for 12 to 15 minutes until soft and ready to mash. Drain and let them steam-dry, then return to the pan with a good knob of butter, some seasoning and the milk. Mash until smooth, adding a splash more milk if you need it. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve., When the pork is ready, remove it from the oven on to a plate and cover with tin foil, so it can rest for about 20 minutes while you crack on with the gravy. You’ll have some nice roasted root veg and sticky goodness left in the bottom of the tray. Pour or spoon off the excess fat in the tray, then place it over a very low heat and pour in the stock a little at a time (you may not need to use all of it), using a potato masher as you go to mash up all the vegetables. Keep stirring to make sure you get all the lovely sticky brown bits off the bottom of the tray. Add the flour and keep reducing the gravy down until you get the consistency you like.

Boil for 3 to 4 minutes, then transfer to a bowl of cold water. Once cooled, carefully peel them., Squeeze the sausages out of their skins and into a bowl., Pick and finely chop the herb leaves, add to the sausage meat along with a good grating of nutmeg, the mustard and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Give it all a good mix together then divide into 8 balls., Have 3 plates ready - one with a small handful of flour, one with the two remaining eggs (beat them together first), and a third with the breadcrumbs., Start by flouring your hands, then in the palm of one hand, flatten one of the sausage balls into an oval-shaped pattie., Roll a peeled egg in flour, then pop it in the middle of the patty Gently shape the meat evenly around the egg, moulding it with your hands until sealed., Roll the meat-wrapped egg in the flour, shake off any excess, then dip into the beaten egg, followed by the breadcrumbs. Roll in the egg and breadcrumbs again for a really good coating., Heat the oil in a deep pan or deep fat fryer to about 150ºC/300ºF. If you have a cooking thermometer it’s a good idea to use it. Otherwise, test if the oil is hot enough by adding a piece of raw potato and leaving it for about 1 minute – if it sizzles and browns, it’s ready., Carefully lower the eggs into the pan and cook for 4 minutes, or until golden, turning them every so often. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper (if you’re worried about the meat being under-cooked, deep-fry the scotch eggs until they’re golden and crispy, then pop them in a hot oven for a couple of minutes.), Cool the Scotch eggs slightly, then arrange on board with a good piece of Scottish Cheddar, some pickle and a few pickled onions.

Finely slice the bacon., Heat the oil in a very large casserole pan over a medium-low heat, add the bacon, followed by the onion, garlic, carrot, celery and squash and cook gently for about 15 minutes, or until soft., Add the mince, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook for about 10 minutes., Turn the heat up, pour in the wine and leave to bubble and cook away for a few minutes, then tip in the tomatoes and 2 tins' worth of water. Drop in the rosemary sprigs and bay leaf, and season with sea salt and black pepper., Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 1½ hours. After this time, if the ragù is still quite liquidy, remove the lid, turn the heat up and simmer for a few more minutes, or until thickened and reduced., Eat straight away, or if you’re making this ahead of time, allow to cool, then divide between containers or plastic freezer bags."

Lay out 3 slices of the prosciutto so they overlap. Repeat with the rest of the prosciutto so you have 4 piles., Put a frying pan over a high heat. Season the chops well with salt and pepper, then sear in the hot pan on both sides. Place a seared chop on top of each pile of prosciutto. Divide the sliced apple and Stilton between the prosciutto piles, on top of the pork., Wrap the prosciutto around each of the pork, apple and Stilton parcels to hold it all in place. Secure each with a rosemary sprig. Place the prosciutto parcels on a baking tray and bake in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through. Serve with mashed potato and greens and cooking juices from the parcels."

You see, we’ve become attracted to breeds of pigs that grow very fast to be butchered and sold on ASAP, whereas our old farming methods used breeds that are now considered rare. They take longer to grow to maturity, which gives the meat a fantastic depth of flavour and plenty of snowy white, waxy fat that just melts in the pan. Once you’ve tried that, everything else comes second best., Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Parboil your potatoes in salted boiling water for around 15 minutes until tender, then drain. Score the pork skin, season it and put it in a hot roasting tray with a drizzle of olive oil. As it begins to crisp up, add your potatoes and thyme. Toss once or twice (making sure the crackling ends up on top of the potatoes so it crisps up even more) and put in the oven for around 15 minutes until cooked., Meanwhile, pound up your fennel seeds and bay leaves in a pestle and mortar with 2 tablespoons of salt until you have a fine green moist paste. Shake this through a sieve into a bowl – this will stop it from sticking together in lumps. Pat your pork chops with a little oil – this will stop them sticking to the pan. Season the pork chops on both sides with the herb salt and keep any excess to use another day. Preheat your griddle pan until really hot. Don’t add any extra oil to the pan – if you do it will start to smoke. Add your pork chops, and cook for around 3-4 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the pork. Try to avoid the temptation to overcook them. Once cooked allow to rest for about 4 minutes., Heat a little pan and add the cider and mustard. Bring to the boil, then reduce by half and add the crème fraîche. Bring back to the boil and reduce again until the sauce thickens, then remove from the heat. Add the butter and shake the pan around a bit so the sauce thickens and shines. Season to taste., Serve up the potatoes – I like to bash up half of them so they kind of smash and crumble – with the pork, a lovely piece of crackling and any resting juices from the meat. Drizzle over the cider sauce and eat – what a pleasure. Nice with a simple green salad and a pint of cider."

cut 8 to fit your griddle pan and soak them in a tray of water to stop them burning. Put all your kebab ingredients into a bowl and use your clean hands to mix everything together really well. Cover with clingfilm, then pop into the fridge for 30 minutes, or longer if you want the flavours to get a bit more intense., Meanwhile, blacken the peppers directly over the flame of your hob, in a hot dry griddle pan or under a hot grill. Turn them every so often and when they look almost ruined, pop them into a bowl, cover with clingfilm and put to one side to steam for 5 minutes or so – this will help their skins to come off., Make your tzatziki by coarsely grating the cucumber into a sieve set up over a bowl. Add a few good pinches of sea salt, then use your hands to squeeze out as much water as you can. Pour the water away, then tip the cucumber into the empty bowl and add the yoghurt. Pound the garlic in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of salt until you have a paste, and spoon that into the bowl with the cucumber. Add the dried mint and red wine vinegar and mix really well. Have a taste to make sure you’ve got the balance right, then put aside., Preheat a griddle pan or grill on a high heat. Thread the skewers through the marinated pork pieces, leaving little spaces between them so that the heat cooks everything evenly. Cook the kebabs on the screaming hot griddle or grill for about 8 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally until done on all sides. Warm your flatbreads in the oven or in a hot dry pan while your kebabs are cooking., Just before your kebabs are ready, peel and deseed your blackened peppers, then tear them into strips and put them into a bowl. Roll up your mint leaves, finely slice them and add to the bowl along with the dill. Add a few splashes of red wine vinegar, a pinch or two of salt and black pepper and a lug of extra virgin olive oil. Toss and mix together, then have a taste to check the balance of flavours. Cut your lemon into wedges., Put a dollop of tzatziki and the meat from one skewer on each warmed flatbread. Top with some of your pepper mixture, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a good squeeze of lemon juice. Life doesn’t get much better."

Drizzle a little olive oil over the pork and season generously with sea salt, black pepper and the paprika., Rub the flavours all over the skin, then place your pork in a roasting tray in the middle of the oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 160ºC/320ºF/gas 3., Cook for about 4 hours, basting occasionally with the juices from the tray, then turn the oven down to 150ºC/300ºF/gas 2 and continue to cook for another 2 hours, or until you can pull the meat apart really easily., Remove the crackling and put it to one side, then remove any fat from the tray. Pull all the pork apart, discarding any bones and fat as you go, and use 2 forks to break the meat into small- and medium-sized pieces. Cover with foil until needed., To make the coleslaw, finely slice all the veg (peeling and trimming first, if necessary) or use a food processor or box grater, then very finely slice the apples. Put them into a large bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper., Add the mayonnaise, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, a pinch of cayenne and the red wine vinegar. Mix everything together until you’ve got a perfect coleslaw texture. Taste and season to perfection., Pick the mint leaves and finely chop them on a large board. Deseed and finely chop the chilli. Drizzle the olive oil and red wine vinegar all over the chilli and mint and add a good pinch of salt. Add this to the tray of pulled pork and mix it all together., Serve the dressed pork in a pile on to a plate next to some crackling and a good portion of that wonderful coleslaw. Finish the whole plate off with a little salt and a hit of paprika and tuck in with a lovely cold beer."

240ºC/475ºF/gas 9. First, score the skin of the pork in a criss-cross pattern every 1cm/½ inch with a sharp knife, trying not to cut into the meat itself. Mix a little salt with a teaspoon of paprika, the lemon juice and a little olive oil, then rub this over the meat and into the score lines. Put the meat in a high-sided roasting tray and cook in the preheated oven for 30 minutes to start the skin crisping up., Remove the meat from the oven, turning the heat down to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Take the pork out of the tray and put it to one side, then spoon out half the fat and discard it. Place the tray on the hob, add the onions, whole chillies, chorizo, bay leaves and rosemary with the remaining paprika, and fry gently until the onions are soft. Add all the tomatoes, the beans, garlic, parsley and a wineglass of water to the tray, stirring and scraping up all the lovely sticky bits from the bottom. Place the pork on top, return to the oven and cook for another hour or so or until the skin is crispy and the meat is meltingly tender., When cooked, remove the pork from the tray and allow to rest. Taste the sauce and season with salt, pepper and a few swigs of red wine vinegar to give it a twang. Then remove the chillies and control the heat by chopping up as much chilli as you like and stirring it back into the sauce. Lovely served with soured cream."

Drain, return to the pan and cover., Meanwhile, trim the strip of skin from each chop in 1 piece and set aside., Rub the chops with a little oil, then pick and press a couple of sage leaves on to each side, and season well with sea salt and black pepper., Place a wide ovenproof frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the strips of skin, skin-side down, place a heavy pan on top to keep them flat, then fry for a couple of minutes, or until crisp – just like crackling., Push the crackling strips to the side of the pan, add the pork chops, and fry for 1 minute on each side. Transfer the pan to the oven (if you don't have an ovenproof pan, transfer the chops to a preheated baking tray instead). Roast for 10 to 15 minutes (depending on the thickness of the chops), or until cooked through., Meanwhile, chop half the watercress, pick and finely chop the parsley and trim and finely chop the spring onions., Heat the milk with the bay leaves until almost boiling, then add the parsley, spring onions and the chopped watercress. Switch off the heat and leave the bay leaves to infuse in the milk for a few minutes, then fish out the bay leaves and discard., Add the warm potatoes to the milk and mash until smooth. Season well with sea salt and black pepper. Cover with a lid and keep warm, until needed., Put a little butter on top of the champ, and serve with the pork chops, crackling and remaining watercress."

The best advice I can give you is about flavouring them. A few smashed garlic cloves, a woody herb like rosemary, thyme, sage or bay, and a splash of vinegar, or squeezed lemon or orange juice, can accentuate their natural flavour., Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Put your carrots into a large pot and your beets into another, and add enough water to cover them. Season with salt and bring to the boil. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes until just tender, then drain and place in separate bowls. Peel your beets, and cut any larger carrots and beets in half or into quarters. Smaller ones can stay whole., Now add your flavourings while the veg are still hot. Toss the carrots with half the smashed garlic and a lug of olive oil, then lightly season. Add the orange juice and the thyme leaves and toss again. Mix the beets with the rest of the garlic, the rosemary, balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper. You can now put the veg either into separate ovenproof dishes, or together on a large roasting tray with the carrots in one half of the tray and the beets in the other. Place in middle of the preheated oven and roast for around half an hour or until golden., While the carrots and beets are cooking, lay the pork chops on a board and score through the skin and the streaky-looking part of the meat. This will give you lovely crackling. Look at the picture – you’ll see what I mean. Firmly press a sage leaf on to the eye meat on both sides of each chop. Season with salt and pepper., When the vegetables start to colour, heat a large ovenproof frying pan or small roasting tray on the hob, add a good lug of olive oil and put in the chops. As soon as you’ve got nice colour on one side, turn the chops over and place the tray in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the chops are crisp on the outside and just cooked through and juicy in the middle. Remove the chops to a warmed plate. Pour most of the fat away from the tray and add a squeeze of lemon juice to it. Stir and scrape the lovely sticky bits off the bottom and drizzle all over the chops. Remove the carrots and beets from the oven – they should be nice and sticky by now. Serve them with the chops and a glass of wine."

You also end up with a wonderful rich sticky sauce!, Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Heat an appropriately sized casserole-type pan, add a lug of olive oil and sweat the onions and garlic gently until soft. Roll the pork in the seasoning and thyme leaves. Push the onions to one side of the pan, add a knob of butter and brown the pork lightly all over., Stir the quartered figs into the onions, pour one glass of Marsala over the meat and drop in the rest of the butter. Tear a piece of greaseproof paper big enough to cover the pork comfortably, scrunch it up with your hands and run it under the cold tap. Unravel it and tuck it in the pot over the pork, figs and onions. This will help the pork steam as well as roast and keep it really moist and juicy., Place in the hot oven. After 20 minutes, lift off the paper, turn the pork in the juices and add the other glass of Marsala. Replace the paper and cook for 30 to 40 minutes more. Check the pork is cooked, remove to a plate and allow it to rest for 15 minutes before slicing., While the meat is resting, finish the sauce by skimming any fat off the top, adding the chicken stock and simmering for 10 minutes. Check the seasoning and add the crème fraîche if using. Slice the pork as thinly as you want and serve with the delicious sauce."

If you’ve got a good relationship with your butcher, you can ask him to do this for you., Pick the rosemary leaves and peel and finely slice the garlic.

Keep bashing until the mixture is nice and fine, then rub it all over the pork — making sure you get it into the incisions., Place the pork on a roasting tray, scatter with the whole rosemary sprigs, then put into your hot oven. Immediately turn the temperature down to 200°C/400°F/gas 6 and roast the pork for 1 hour 20 minutes or until crisp, golden and cooked through. If the crackling isn’t as crisp as you would like it, remove the skin from the pork and place under a hot grill for 5 to 10 minutes., Meanwhile, get your salad together. Wash and spin-dry all of your leaves, then put them in the fridge until you are ready to go., For the yoghurt dressing, pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves. Deseed and finely chop the chillies and add to a bowl with the parsley and yoghurt. Add a good squeeze of lemon juice, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a nice big pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix well, then set aside., Just before you want to serve your kebabs, pop your pitta breads in the oven for a few minutes or warm them in a griddle pan. Serve the pork on a board with a big carving knife, salad leaves, a pile of warm pittas and bowls of chilli yoghurt. Let everyone carve their own pork and help themselves to a beautiful kebab."

Break the garlic bulb up into unpeeled cloves, peel and chop the onions into large wedges, then toss into the tray with the thyme sprigs., Put the seasoned pork belly on top of the vegetables in the tray, then roast for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the skin starts to bubble and turn golden brown., Reduce the oven temperature to 170°C/325°F/gas 3, and roast for 1  hour 30 minutes. When the time's up, carefully open the oven door and pour in three-quarters of the wine. Cook for 1 further hour., Remove the meat carefully from the oven and test to see if it pulls apart easily. If not, cook for a little longer. Allow the meat to rest while you make the gravy., Put the tray of roasted vegetables directly onto your hob over a medium heat add, add the flour, then stir together until thick. Cook for 1 minute then add in the remaining wine – if you sauce is too thick add a splash more wine or water., Using a potato masher, mash up the vegetables until you have a delicious thick-looking sauce. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on a low heat, season to taste, then strain through a sieve into a jug., Remove the crackling from the top of the belly and break up into pieces, pull the pork belly apart, and serve with the jug of gravy on the side, and a selection of seasonal vegetables."

Although the rest of the ingredients are for one topping, there is no point in cooking less pork than this – you can use any leftovers in sandwiches. This is also a great way to use up leftovers from a roast pork joint., Preheat your oven to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3. Score the pork shoulder. Bash the fennel seeds and rub them over the pork, then season and rub with olive oil. Roast in the preheated oven for at least 4 hours, until the meat is tender and shreds easily. When cool, shred up using a fork or your hands. Dress the meat with a little of the cooking juices – it will have almost the texture of a confit of duck., Smear the tomato sauce thinly over the pizza base and scatter over a small handful of your roasted pork and some small pieces of Taleggio. Sprinkle with the thyme leaves, drizzle with olive oil and cook until crisp and golden. Dress the rocket with a tiny bit of lemon juice, scatter over the pizza and serve."

Lay the steaks out on a chopping board and drizzle a little olive oil over each one. Sprinkle over the garlic, sage, a good sprinkling of salt and lots of ground black pepper. Grate the zest of the lemon onto the steaks, then cut the lemon in two and squeeze one of the halves over them as well. Rub this marinade into both sides of each steak with your fingers so they are evenly oiled and seasoned., Place the steaks on your griddle or in a hot frying-pan (they make a bit of smoke, so get your fan on!). Make sure you don’t have too many in the pan at one time – there should be a gap between the steaks and they shouldn’t be touching each other at all, so if your pan isn’t big enough, cook in batches., Turn the steaks over after two minutes, then turn every minute until they’ve had 8 minutes cooking time in total. Squeeze the other half of the lemon over the cooked steaks and let them sizzle for a moment, then lift them out of the pan with tongs to a plate to rest for a minute before serving. Absolutely delicious served with some oven-baked jacket potato wedges, a lovely green salad and some hot chilli sauce."

wedges","Heat a large wide-based pan over a medium heat and add a lug of olive oil, the sliced chorizo and the pork belly. Fry for around 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. As soon as the chorizo starts taking on colour and the fat is beginning to cook out of it, add the chopped peppers, garlic, onion and parsley stalks along with a good pinch of salt and pepper and the saffron. Fry gently for another 10 minutes, or until the vegetables have begun to soften. Meanwhile pick through the shellfish and get rid of any clams or mussels that aren't tightly closed., Add the rice and jarred peppers and keep stirring for a few minutes until the rice is coated in all the lovely flavours, then pour in the tinned tomatoes and 800ml of stock, seasoning again with salt and pepper. Bring everything to the boil, then turn down to a medium to low heat and stir constantly for about 15 minutes. This combination of flavours will be absolutely beautiful, but you’ve got to help the dish along by doing your job and making sure each grain of rice gets the same amount of love. So every now and then, stir from the outside of the pan into the middle so you get a sort of pile of rice in the centre, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom. Flatten the pile out with your spoon, then start the whole process again., After 15 minutes the rice should be cooked, but still have a bit of a bite, so add the mussels or clams and the prawns. You may want to add an extra splash of stock here if the rice looks a bit dry. Keep stirring, and as the clams and mussels start to open and the prawns begin to turn pink, add your squid and green beans and cook for a further 5 minutes or so. Discard any clams or mussels that don't open. Stir in the chopped parsley leaves and the juice from half your lemon wedges, and bring to the table with the remaining lemon wedges on the side and a crisp green salad."

But even though a whole roasted shoulder is really impressive, it’s actually a ‘slam and go’ recipe. Of course it’s lovely served with roast potatoes and orchard apple sauce, but lately, I’ve been pulling all the meat apart and tossing it through this great jerk salsa – hell, yeah! The flavours of Jamaica and Britain really work well together – and actually many of the same spices found in jerk can also be found in some of the most quintessentially British puddings, syrups and even our beloved mulled wine. This is my version of jerk-dressed pork, and I love it., Preheat the oven to full whack (about 240°C/475°F/gas 9). Carefully score the skin and fat on the shoulder into zigzags about 1cm deep, using a very sharp knife or a clean Stanley knife. Sprinkle and rub in a good pinch of salt, pepper, dried rosemary, thyme, and a few good gratings of nutmeg. Add a lug of olive oil, then rub those flavours all over the meat and into the scores. Place the pork, skin side up, in your largest roasting pan. Pour one of the bottles of cider into the bottom of the tray, put into the hot oven for 30 minutes so the crackling gets going, then turn the heat down to 130°C/250°F/gas ½., After the pork has been in for an hour, add the rest of the cider and cook for a further 6 to 7 hours, or until the meat pulls apart easily. Halfway through the cooking time cover with a double layer of tin foil., Once the pork is perfectly cooked, move it to a large serving board or platter. Carefully pour any fat from the roasting tray into a Kilner jar for some lucky roast potato some day, but leave the wonderful flavourful cooking juices in the pan. Then add the Scotch bonnets to a liquidizer with the spring onions, spices, the juice from the limes, ginger, bay leaves, garlic, a squeeze of honey and 2 lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Pulse together until you get a salsa consistency, then mix the salsa into the juices in the roasting tray, have a taste and balance out the salt and acid if needed. It should have attitude and loads of personality. Pour that salsa on to a platter, then pull the crispy crackling off the shoulder, get rid of any flobbery fat underneath, and use two forks to roughly pull the meat apart. Pile the meat on top of the salsa and toss together quickly., Tear over any coriander leaves and snap those wonderful zigzags of crackling on top of the meat and serve with good quality apple sauce.

It’s a great thing to serve at a party because when you’ve grilled it on all sides for 15 minutes you can just pop it into a hot oven for an hour quite happily and leave it – and you can serve it as a hot roast or have it cold. My boss at the River Café, Rose Gray, used to baste her grilled pork with herb vinegar and bay leaves, which was a tremendous combination, so feel free to do this, or to use rosemary instead of bay. The way we flavoured ours in Italy was with fennel seeds, dried chilli, salt and pepper. I’m going to give you the recipe for 12, but feel free to halve it, or even double it. It’s dead simple, and it’s made even easier if you ask your butcher to prepare the meat for you. Just ask for a 2kg/4½lb loin of pork, off the bone with the skin removed., First of all, smash your fennel seeds up in a pestle and mortar and crumble and bash in your dried chilli – now this is supposed to give a subtle heat, so I’m going to leave it up to you to use as much or as little as you prefer. Put your loin of pork on to a chopping board and score the fat in a criss-cross fashion. Rub the meat all over with a little olive oil, then sprinkle the fennel seeds and chilli all over the pork. Cover the pork up and put it to one side in a roasting tray – if it has come straight out of the fridge let it come to room temperature – so that it can absorb the flavours., About an hour before you’re ready to cook, you need to light your barbecue to let it get to the right temperature. I’d advise you to use charcoal instead of gas so that you get a lovely chargrilled flavour coming through. You can also, of course, roast the meat in the oven, but I prefer to do it on the barbecue. (If you roast it in the oven for the whole time it’ll need 1 hour 20 minutes.) Either way, season the meat quite generously with salt and pepper and place it fat-side down on the grill. This will make the barbecue flame a bit so you’ll probably need to turn it over quickly on to the meat side, but it does tend to get the bars oiled up and the smoke going, which we like. Grill the meat for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on how hot your barbecue is, and remember to keep turning it so it gets those lovely charred bar marks all over it., Remove the pork to the same roasting tray you marinated it in and put it into the oven at 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. After half an hour add the vinegar and rosemary leaves, carefully move the meat around and baste it, and put it back into the oven for another 20 minutes. Remove it from the oven, leave it to rest for 10 minutes, then slice the meat up. All the lovely juices from the tray can be kept warm and poured over the meat just before serving. If you’ve been to Italy, you may have noticed that you really do just get some slices of meat with a simple side dish. At the end of the day, the meat tastes great; so serve it in any way you see fit."

In England, we’re sort of brainwashed into thinking of chilli as just being chilli con carne, but this is completely different and I absolutely love it. I think it’s cleaner, braver and fresher than your average chilli. You can make your own flatbreads or use tortillas, or you can even serve with chapattis or naans instead., Put a large pan on a high heat and add a little olive oil. Add the pork mince, dried sage and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat up a bit and stir it about, then cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. Add your onions, garlic, peppers and chillies, stir everything together, then fry for 15 minutes on a high heat until any liquid from the pork has evaporated and everything is starting to turn golden. When it looks good, stir in your chopped tomatoes and half a glass of water. Remember that it’s supposed to be quite dry (in a really wholesome and nice way), not stewy and wet, so don’t add too much water., Turn the heat down to medium and let it tick away for 10 minutes or so while you wash and roughly chop up the lettuce. Pick the leaves from the bunch of mint and roughly chop them. Trim and finely slice your spring onions., When you’re ready to serve your chilli, warm your tortillas in the oven at 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for a few minutes or in a dry pan for 30 seconds. Taste your dense chilli. More than likely it will need another good pinch of salt and pepper. If you want to give it a nice fresh edge, you can squeeze in the juice of a lime. Stir in half your chopped mint., Push a warm tortilla or flatbread into each of your little bowls and spoon some delicious green chilli on top of each one. Top with your chopped lettuce and a dollop of yoghurt. Sprinkle over the rest of your mint and spring onions and serve right away with some cold beers."

It looks and tastes beautiful, but don’t be intimidated because it’s really not hard to do at all. Get your butcher to butterfly the meat for you then make this beautiful stuffing and roll it up inside the meat before you roast it. You’ll want to have a piece of string about an arm’s length handy to tie your meat up once you’ve rolled it., Preheat your oven to full whack. Lay the boned shoulder of pork on a board, skin-side down, and season well with a few really good sprinkles of salt and pepper. Massage this seasoning all over the meat., Put a large pan on a medium heat and fry your diced onion in a lug of olive oil for about 10 minutes and when it’s softened but not coloured, turn the heat down to low and add the chopped chicken livers and pork mince. Use a wooden spoon to break the mince up a bit and mix everything together. Add the pine nuts, raisins, chopped sage and parsley, then season with a good sprinkle of salt and pepper. Pour in a splash of red or mulled wine, give everything a good stir then take your pan off the heat. You don’t want to cook the meat now, you just want to get a good mix of flavours going so you have a delicious stuffing., Put the stuffing in a bowl and put it to one side to cool down. Once your stuffing has completely cooled, spoon all of it down the middle of the opened shoulder. Roll the meat up quite tightly then tie it up as tightly as you can with 4 or 5 pieces of string. Drizzle all over with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and rub the seasoning all over the skin to help it turn into delicious crackling. Lay your carrots across the middle of the roasting tray and put the meat on top. Pour your glass of red or mulled wine and a glass of water in the bottom of the tray then put your meat in the oven. Turn the heat down immediately to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for about 3 ½ to 4 hours until lovely and golden. Once it’s out of the oven carefully remove the skin and put it to one side. Slice the pork then serve it with some tasty bits of broken up crackling, lovely potatoes and a few greens or a nice salad. Absolutely gorgeous."

board with the sweet smoked paprika and fennel seeds and toss with the diced pork belly. Give your hands a good wash. Pop a large pan over a medium heat, add a small splash of oil and the spiced pork and fry for 5 minutes, or until crispy and golden. Jiggle the pan every so often., Meanwhile, flip the board over and give your knife a quick clean. Use a spoon to scoop out the avocado flesh, then chop up into rough 1cm chunks with the tomatoes. Finely chop the chilli, then toss it together to make a sort of crude salsa., By this point the pork will be lovely and gnarly so drain and add the haricot beans, if using, and cook for a further 2 to 4 minutes, or until thick and combined., Squeeze the juice from one of the limes over the salsa, season well and toss to dress. Check on the pork – add the honey at this point, if you like, to give it an incredible shine, then season and toss everything together., Get yourself a big board or plank for serving, and ruffle up a tea towel to hold your taco shells. Divide the meat between them. Mix the coriander through the salsa then dot some over each taco, along with a dollop of yoghurt and an extra squeeze of lime juice, then tuck in."

In this recipe, we're going to get nice thin escalopes of pork from the leg, flavour them and prepare them so they cook quickly. You could also use chicken or even veal in the same way, if you fancy.

Rub the goat's cheese with a little olive oil and cook on a hot griddle on both sides until nicely coloured. Remove and put to one side. Bash up the garlic and lemon thyme in a pestle and mortar (or use a metal bowl and the end of a rolling pin). Add a couple of splashes of olive oil, stir, and rub the mixture all over the pork escalopes., Season the pork then put the escalopes, one by one, between 2 large pieces of cling film and hit them with something heavy and flat until they're about 0.5cm thick. This will make them really tender. Do this to all 4 escalopes., Check that your griddle pan is hot, and chargrill your asparagus, then your courgettes, on both sides. Mark them nicely to give a bit of flavour and character to them. Put them into a salad bowl with the vinegar, 8 tablespoons of olive oil and half the fresh mint. Using the griddle pan again, chargrill your pork escalopes on both sides until nicely marked – about 4 minutes., Tear each escalope in half and scatter these into the salad bowl with the rest of the mint (for a lovely fresh burst of flavour) and the crumbled goat's cheese. Toss well, then place the bowl in the middle of the table and let everyone tuck in."

Set aside. Toast the bread cubes in the pork fat under the grill until brown and crispy., Dress the anchovies with a little lemon juice and zest, extra virgin olive oil and some chopped flat-leaf parsley. To make a dressing for the salad, use 3 parts extra virgin olive oil to 1 part lemon juice and season it well with salt and pepper. Line a cup with cling film, pour the dressing in, gather up the edges and tie in a knot.

Turn the chipolatas over, add the mushrooms to the tray, face up, drizzle with a little oil and season with sea salt and black pepper., Lay the bacon in and around everything and pop the tray back under the grill for another 7 to 8 minutes, or until the chipolatas are cooked through., When the tray of extras is just about perfect, turn the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and pop them down at the bottom of the oven to keep warm,, Give the bubble and squeak one final pat down and use the back of a spoon to make four dents, evenly spaced around the pan. Crack in the eggs – it looks fantastic, isn’t predictable and saves on washing up., Season with a tiny bit of salt and pepper and put in the oven for about 8 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking., To serve, pop the tray of bubble & squeak and eggs in the middle of the table with the tray of extras on the side."

Finely grate in the orange zest and squeeze in the juice., Pick and very finely chop the thyme, and peel and finely chop the garlic, then add to the marinade with the ketchup and balsamic vinegar. Muddle together., Season the pork fillets with sea salt and black pepper, then toss in most of the marinade, to coat., Leave to marinate for half a day, but at least an hour. If you have metal or wooden skewers, lay the fillets side by side and skewer them together about 2.5cm apart., When you're ready to cook, simply put the meat on to a barbecue or under a hot grill for 15 to 20 minutes, or until nicely charred. Every time you turn the meat, brush it generously with the leftover marinade so you build up a sticky, blackened glaze., When they're done, put the fillets on a big platter and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Slice the meat between the skewers, or just slice each fillet in half., Pick, finely chop and sprinkle over the coriander and squeeze over some lemon juice, if you fancy."

Get yourself a small sharp knife and make scores about 1cm apart through the skin into the fat, but not so deep that you cut into the meat. If the joint is tied, try not to cut through the string., Rub sea salt right into all the scores you’ve just made, pulling the skin apart a little if you need to. Brush any excess salt off the surface then turn it over. Season the underside of the meat with a few pinches of salt and black pepper., Place the pork, skin-side up, in a roasting tray and roast for 30 minutes, or until the skin has started to puff up and you can see it turning into crackling. At this point, turn the heat down to 170°C/325°F/gas 3, cover the pork snugly with a double layer of tin foil, pop back in the oven and roast for a further 4½ hours., Meanwhile, halve the onions, carrots and celery, and break the garlic up into cloves (there's no need to peel them)., Remove the pork from the oven, take off the foil, and baste the meat with the fat in the bottom of the tray. Carefully transfer to a board, then skim all but 2 tablespoons of excess fat from the tray into a jar, and pop in the fridge for tasty cooking another day., Add all the veg, garlic and bay leaves to the tray and stir them into the fat. Place the pork back on top of everything and place back in the oven without the foil to roast for 1 further hour, or until meltingly soft and tender., Carefully move the meat to a serving dish, cover again with tin foil and leave to rest while you make the gravy. Spoon away any fat in the tray, then add the stock (or replace with water, if you prefer) and place the tray on the hob., Bring to the boil and simmer for a few minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to scrape up all those lovely sticky tasty bits from the bottom of the tray., When you’ve got a nice, dark gravy, pour it through a sieve into jug using your spoon to really push all the goodness of the veg through the sieve. Season to taste, if needed., Serve the pork and crackling with the jug of gravy and all the trimmings – a dollop of apple sauce will finish this off perfectly."

You’ll easily find all these ingredients at your butcher’s – smoked ribs are sold in Portuguese and Brazilian butchers up and down the country, but if you can’t get them, simply use regular ribs instead. I’m excited to share my Brazilian brother Almir Santos’ recipe here – he’s a wonderful man, a fantastic cook, and I’ve had the pleasure of working with him since I was twenty years old.

cover with plenty of water and put the lid on. Do the same with the chunks of pig’s ear, tail and trotter, then leave both to soak overnight., The next day, place the black beans pan on the hob, topping up with water to cover the beans if needed, then bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 30 minutes (it’s important to keep them in the same water to achieve the most vibrant colour)., Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onions and garlic. Heat a splash of olive oil in a very large casserole pan on a medium-high heat, drain and add the chunks of pig’s ear, tail and trotter and pork belly and fry for 15 minutes, or until golden and gnarly., At this point, go in with three-quarters of the chopped onions, and all the garlic, bay leaves and paprika., Slice up the bacon and chorizo 2cm thick, cut the ribs up, then add it all to the pan and cook for 15 minutes, stirring regularly., When the time’s up, pour the beans into the meat pan with enough of their cooking water to cover everything nicely. Cook on a low heat for 3 hours, or until the meat is tender, stirring occasionally, and topping up with a little more water, if needed., To make the salsa, peel the onion, deseed the tomatoes and pepper, then very finely chop them with the top leafy half of the parsley, mixing as you go. In a bowl, dress with the lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and vinegar, then taste and season to perfection., Just before you’re ready to serve, tear off the leaves of the spring greens, roll up and slice them 1cm thick, then cook with the remaining chopped onions and a splash of olive oil in a large pan on a high heat for 5 minutes., Season the feijoada to taste, then serve with fluffy rice, your spring greens, salsa and plenty of cold beers. To be truly authentic, you want a little bowl of toasted cassava flour on the side to dip each mouthful in, and some hot pickled chillies. Santos also recommends a few fresh wedges of orange to cut through the intensity of the sauce – delicious."
