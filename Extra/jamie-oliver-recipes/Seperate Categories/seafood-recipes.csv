Spice Island coconut fish curry | Jamie Oliver recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/143701487.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",,"“This curry is reminiscent of the beautiful coast of Zanzibar, also
known as Spice Island. Its warming and aromatic flavours will have you looking out the window in search of the dhows, some docking in and others setting sail, as they did when wondrous spices travelled from Asia through Africa to the rest of the world. The warmth of chillies and sweetness of tropical coconuts are embodied in the curries enjoyed across East Africa and the archipelagos on the Indian ocean. Tomatoes give the sauce a good body and there’s a double dose of tartness from limes and tamarind to accompany the firm fish. I enjoy serving this with white rice or My East African Chapati  to soak up the creamy golden sauce, while being transported to this wondrous Spice Island. ”",,,,,,,,,"500

Add the fish and some freshly ground black pepper and turn to coat on all sides. Cover and set aside while you prepare the curry sauce, or keep in the fridge for 1–2 hours., Heat the coconut oil in a wide shallow saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onion and 1 teaspoon fine sea salt and cook for up to 10 minutes, or until softened and translucent, stirring every few minutes. Add the chillies, ginger and garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add a splash of water if it begins to stick. Stir in the turmeric and garam masala or curry powder and cook for a further minute, until fragrant and wonderful., Tip in the tomatoes and their juices, stir and leave to cook for 5 minutes, until the tomatoes begin to break down slightly. Pour in the stock and the coconut milk and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce begins to thicken a little., Stir in the tamarind paste, then add the fish and cook for 3 minutes., Finally, add the prawns and green beans and cook for 3–4 minutes, until the fish is flaky, the prawns are pink and plump and the beans have softened but with a little crunch., Season to perfection and serve sprinkled with coriander, toasted coconut flakes and slices of red chilli, alongside steaming bowls of rice or My East African Chapati."

Crab tostadas | Jamie Oliver recipes,,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/134130692.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",,"“In Coyoacán in Mexico City, my local market has become famous for (among other things) a tostadas stand which has expanded and become hugely popular. The stand offers a wide variety of tostadas: chicken tinga, prawn (shrimp) cocktail, or pata (cow’s hooves), which is one of my favourites.

In the UK, Cornwall is well known for the exceptional quality of its seafood, especially crab. The region is one of our favourite summer holiday destinations thanks to its beautiful landscape and beaches, as well as its culinary specialities.

To pay tribute to this beautiful seafood, I like to pair it with the simple, raw freshness of a jalapeño and lime mayonnaise and serve with crispy tostadas and avocados. You don’t need anything else: just delicious produce on a tostada.

Add a pinch of salt and crush or blend until reduced to a purée. Incorporate the chilli and herb purée into the mayonnaise, then stir in the lime juice and taste for seasoning. Set aside., To make the tostadas, lightly coat both sides of the tortillas with the oil. Arrange the tortillas on the prepared wire rack and bake for 20–30 minutes, or until crispy, turning halfway through. Sprinkle with salt flakes., Place the tostadas, crab, avocado, jalapeño mayonnaise, coriander leaves and lime wedges on a serving platter and let your guests build their own tostadas: first a spread of mayonnaise, then a few avocado slices, followed by some crab meat, coriander leaves and a squeeze of lime."

Peel the prawns (keeping the tails on), throwing the heads and shells into the stock pan as you go. Run the tip of a knife down the backs of the prawns and pull out and discard the dark veins, then score a little deeper so they butterfly as they cook., Slice the sausage into rough chunks, place in a large casserole pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then cook for 10 minutes, or until it has released its tasty fat., Turn down the heat to low, then remove the sausage to a plate, leaving the fat behind in the pan. Stir the butter and flour into the pan, really scraping up all the sticky bits from the bottom. Continue stirring for 15 to 20 minutes (be patient!), or until dark golden brown – think peanut butter, but you can take it even darker, if you prefer (see tip). You want the roux to have a semi-loose, doughy consistency, so add a splash of oil if there isn’t a lot of fat., Deseed the peppers, peel the onion and roughly chop with the celery, then stir into the roux pan (this is called the holy trinity). Scrunch and add the bay leaves and strip in the thyme leaves, then peel, finely chop and add the garlic, followed by the cayenne and Tabasco., Put the sausage back into the pan, then scrunch in the tomatoes using clean hands, stirring as you go. Ladle the stock through a sieve into the pan, then let it blip away for 10 minutes., Trim the green beans, slice each into three pieces, then add to the pan and cook for 6 minutes. Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley., Slice the sea bass fillets lengthways into thin strips, then halve the langoustines and crack the claws (if using). Sort through the cockles or clams and tap them – if any stay open, throw them away., Add all the fish and seafood to the pan and simmer for a few minutes, or until perfectly cooked – the prawns should be pink and the clams or cockles open (discard any that remain closed), stirring regularly., Squeeze over lemon juice to taste, and scatter with the chopped parsley.

Add a good squeeze of lemon juice and a splash of brandy (if using), then have a taste and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. (See tip for brown crab meat below.), Click off any tatty outer leaves from the lettuce, then trim and finely shred. Slice the cucumber and radishes into super-thin rounds with a mandolin, if you have one (use the guard!). Halve, peel and destone the avocado, then finely slice., Mix the crabmeat with the mayo., To serve, arrange a small pile of lettuce in the middle of each plate, top with a few slices of avocado, then arrange the cucumber and radish around the edge, overlapping slightly., Divide the crab between the plates and drizzle over a little Marie Rose sauce. Scatter over the cress and micro herbs, then add a dusting of cayenne pepper and a wedge of lemon. Delicious served with brown bread and butter."

Seared tuna steak | Jamie Oliver fish & seafood recipe,With fresh coriander & basil,"https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/89080404.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066","['Serves', '4']",In15 minutes,"“When buying tuna you should look for meat that is evenly coloured, dark red and has a fine, tight grain free of large sinews. Generally you get better tuna in good fishmongers than in supermarkets, but sometimes the supermarkets get a good batch in, so keep your eyes peeled. There is a bit of a thing about it being fashionable to serve tuna pink; if you buy good-quality fresh tuna the last thing you want to do is cook it all the way through and make it taste like tinned tuna, so yes, good-quality fresh tuna should be served rare or very pink. ”",243,1.8g,0.5g,0.2g,0.9g,57.1g,0.4g,0.6g,"1                                                                                                                                                                small                                                                                                                                                                 dried red chilli, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                coriander seeds, ½                                                                                                                                                                a clove of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 1                                                                                                                                                                good handful of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil, 1                                                                                                                                                                good handful of                                                                                                                                                                fresh coriander, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 4 x 225                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                tuna steaks                                                                                                                                                                , ideally 2cm thick, from sustainable sources","Smash up the chilli and the coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar., Peel and chop the garlic, pick and finely chop the herb leaves and add it all to the pestle and mortar with a drizzle of oil and lemon juice, to taste. Mix together, and season with sea salt and black pepper., Lay out your tuna steaks on a tray, season both sides and rub all over with the herb mixture., There are two nice ways to cook it: I prefer to cook it on a griddle pan or in a frying pan., Your pan should be very, very hot. Put in the tuna and what you want to do is sear it so that it toasts, fries and browns (about 45 to 60 seconds on each side)., Once cooked, I like to rip the steaks in half and serve with salad and chips or boiled potatoes and a big wedge of lemon. It’s quite sexy sometimes with some marinated sun-dried tomatoes, olives, basil… The possibilities are endless."

Parmesan cheese, extra virgin olive oil","Preheat the oven to 160°C/325°F/gas 3., Blanch the tomatoes in a large pan of boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice-cold water and peel the skins. Tip into a medium roasting tray., Peel and slice the garlic, pick the rosemary leaves and scatter over the tomatoes. Drizzle over a little oil, then toss to coat and space them out in a single layer. Roast for 40 minutes, or until golden., Remove the heads and tails from the langoustines, then peel the skin and roughly chop the sweet meat. Check the mussels and sort through the clams, giving any that aren’t tightly closed a tap. If they don’t close, discard them. Finely slice the squid and reserve for later.  Pick through the crab meat, removing any shell., Put the saffron in a small bowl, cover with 50ml of freshly boiled water and leave to infuse., For the risotto, peel and finely chop the onion, celery and fennel, reserving any nice leaves and herby tops for garnish, then place in a large, high-sided pan on a medium heat with 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Cook for 15 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally, then stir in the rice to toast for 2 minutes., Pour in the wine, and stir until absorbed. Add a ladleful of stock and wait until it’s been fully absorbed before adding another, stirring for around 10 seconds every minute and continuing to add ladlefuls of stock until the rice is soft and a pleasure to eat, but retains its shape and a tiny bit of bite. It will need 16 to 18 minutes,, Add the saffron and its soaking liquid, then stir in the mussels and clams., When the mussels are just starting to open up, go in with the squid, crab and langoustine. 
Beat in the butter, finely grate and and beat in the Parmesan, then season to perfection and turn the heat off. Cover the pan and leave to relax for 1 to 2 minutes so the risotto becomes creamy and oozy. Beat again, adding a little extra stock if necessary., Carefully pour the risotto onto a large platter and discard any mussels or clams that remain closed. Dot over the roasted tomatoes, scatter over the reserved celery leaves and herby fennel tops, then drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil. Dish up and enjoy!"

We’re making a mind-blowing salsa to plunge the hot grilled squid straight into, creating a wonderful harmony between flavour and texture.

garlic, celery (picking and saving any yellow leaves from the head) and potato., Finely chop the onion and garlic with the chilli (deseed, if you like) and parsley stalks (reserving the leaves)., Chop the celery and potato into 1cm chunks., Place it all in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil, and cook for 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally., Stir in the Prosecco and let it simmer for 2 minutes., Pour in the passata and half a jar’s worth of water, add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then add the bream and langoustines, pushing them down into the sauce. Simmer gently while you quickly pick through the mussels and clams, tapping any open ones – if they don’t close, discard them., Finely slice the squid into rings., Add the mussels, clams, squid and peas to the pan with a splash of water, if needed, then cover and leave for a few minutes, or until the mussels and clams have opened (discard any that remain closed)., Place a slice of bread in each of your bowls (toast first, if you like), ladle the stew on top, dollop each portion with ½ a tablespoon of aïoli (saving the rest for another day), then tear over the reserved parsley and any celery leaves., If you’ve got them, fennel tops are a lovely finishing touch, too."

Add the butter and blend again to combine., Lay the langoustines cut-side-up on a large roasting tray, loosen them within their shells, and spoon over the ’nduja butter., Place under the grill for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the butter is bubbling and the langoustines are golden. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice, and serve with napkins and toothpicks for picking the meat."

sea salt and black pepper, squeeze over the juice of 1 lime and set aside for 10 minutes., Pick and finely chop most of the fresh coriander leaves for the dip (reserving some for a garnish) and stir through the yoghurt in a small bowl., Peel and crush the garlic, and add to the yoghurt along with the zest of the clementine half. Season to taste and set aside., Crush the chipotle flakes using a pestle and mortar. Transfer to a large, shallow dish with the ground coriander, cornflour and a pinch of salt, then mix well. Pour the milk into a separate bowl., Pour the oil into a large, thick-bottomed saucepan to a depth of around 6cm (it should be no more than two-thirds full). Heat it to 170ºC/325ºF (if you don’t have a thermometer, dip the end of a wooden spoon in the oil – if it starts bubbling rapidly around the spoon, it’s ready)., Slice the clementines as thinly as you can – about 1mm. This can be fiddly, so don’t worry about getting perfect rounds., Pat the fish and clementine slices with kitchen paper to soak up any excess juice. Coat them in the cornflour, then dip briefly in the milk before coating again in flour, shaking off the excess., Deep fry the fish and clementine in batches for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden., Drain on kitchen paper and scatter with salt, chipotle and the reserved coriander.

It’s an absolute belter of a dish, and much simpler to make than you might think. It’s a real celebration of the juice and flavour of clams, and once you know how, it’s a brilliantly quick and easy dish that’ll hit the spot on the flavour front, every time.

Once hot, put 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the remaining mint leaves in to crisp up for 1 minute, then scoop the leaves on to a plate, leaving the oil behind., Season the scallops with sea salt and black pepper and fry for 2 minutes on each side, or until golden. Crumble in the black pudding (discarding the skin) so it crisps up alongside., Drain the peas and potatoes, return to the pan, mash well with the chopped mint and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, taste and season to perfection., Plate up with the scallops and black pudding, drizzle lightly with extra virgin olive oil, and sprinkle over the crispy mint."

Place the heads and shells in a pan with the saffron, pour over the stock, then simmer over a low heat to infuse., Dice the chicken and pork into 3cm chunks, then toss with the paprika and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Place a large ovenproof frying or paella pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the meat and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden, stirring occasionally, while you peel and finely chop the onion, garlic and celery., Remove the meat to a plate and stir the chopped veg into the fat in the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened, then return the meat to the mix., At the same time, quickly drop the crayfish into the stock to cook for 4 minutes, remove with a slotted spoon, halve lengthways and place in a large bowl., Cut a cross into the bottom of each tomato, plunge them into the stock for 40 seconds, then carefully peel, deseed and roughly chop., Stir the paella rice into the meat pan to toast for a few minutes, then ladle in 1 litre of stock through a sieve. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced and the rice is nearly cooked, stirring occasionally., Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the parsley. Run the tip of a knife down the back of each prawn and pull out the vein, meaning they’ll butterfly as they cook., Slice the tentacles from the squid, keeping them whole, then open out the tubes and lightly score in a criss-cross fashion with a regular eating knife., Place the prawns, squid and mussels in the crayfish bowl with the drained artichokes, most of the parsley and the mangetout (roughly slice, if you like), then dress with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, the juice of 1 lemon and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper., Poke and scatter the contents of the bowl into the rice, then place uncovered in the oven for 10 minutes, or until beautifully cooked. Scatter over the remaining parsley leaves and serve with lots of lemon wedges for squeezing over."

Pop a weight on top to help pack everything down evenly, then put the whole thing into the fridge for 36 hours. Please use your instincts here – if you have a particularly chunky side of salmon you may want to leave it for up to 48 hours to allow for proper penetration., Once cured, unwrap the fish, then, holding the fillet in place, pour the juices down the sink and rub away all the salty topping (it’s messy, so you might want to wear gloves)., Pat the fillet dry with kitchen paper, then tightly wrap in clingfilm (sometimes I like to cover the salmon with freshly picked dill before wrapping, for bonus flavour). Put back into the fridge until needed, where it will keep happily for up to 2 weeks., To serve, use a long sharp knife to slice the salmon thinly at an angle and, as the knife touches the skin each time, kink it off, lifting away the salmon., Arrange the slices on a board or platter as you go. Delicious with a simple salad and good wholemeal sourdough, as part of a seafood platter, served up at a party or even as part of a festive brekkie spread."

Finely grate the lime zest into a food processor, and squeeze in the juice. Deseed the chilli, roughly chop the coriander and peel and roughly chop the ginger, then add to the processor., Drizzle over the fish sauce, then add the palm sugar, and blitz until finely chopped. Season to taste and set aside., Pour 3cm of sunflower oil into a wide, deep saucepan and place over a medium heat until the oil reaches 180ºC on a thermometer. You can also test that the oil is hot enough with a little bit of noodle – it should crisp up and turn lightly golden., Meanwhile, break up the noodles into 5cm strips. Prepare a plate lined with kitchen paper and have a slotted spoon ready. Fry the noodles in the oil, in batches for 30 seconds at a time, turning halfway through, then transfer to your lined plate to drain., Heat 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil in a large frying pan over a medium–high heat, add the prawns and fry for 4 minutes, turning halfway through, or until cooked through and lightly golden – you may need to work in batches., Tip the prawns onto a serving dish, drizzle over the nam jim dressing and toss to combine. Trim and finely slice the spring onions., To serve, sprinkle the crispy noodles and spring onions over the prawns, then bring to the table with lots of forks and let people dig in."

Ask your fishmonger to kill it for you, or if you’re happy doing it yourself, place the live lobster in the freezer for 30 minutes, so it’s docile., When ready to cook, carefully and swiftly place the lobster in a large pan of boiling water head first, pop the lid on and cook for 8 minutes., Remove, cool, and carefully halve the lobster, then remove the meat to a bowl – save the claws to decorate, if you like, or, even better, crack, pull out the meat and add it to the bowl., Put all the shells back into the empty pan you cooked the lobster in and bash with a rolling pin, then pour in the milk and simmer on a low heat for 15 to 20 minutes to impart unbelievable flavour., Meanwhile, peel the onion and carrot, trim the fennel, wash the leek, finely chop it all and place in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and half the butter. Cook for 15 minutes, or until soft and sticky, stirring regularly., Stir in the flour, followed by the mustard and Prosecco. Let the alcohol bubble and cook away, then strain and gradually stir in the milk and simmer until you have a nice, loose, silky consistency., Remove from the heat, grate in the Lancashire cheese, taste, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper and leave to cool., Peel the potatoes, cutting up any larger ones so they’re all a similar size, then cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 15 to 20 minutes, or until cooked through., Drain in a colander and leave to steam dry, then return to the pan and mash well with the remaining butter and the grated Red Leicester. Season to perfection with sea salt and cayenne, loosening with a splash of milk, if needed., Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4., Remove any tough stalks from the greens, then finely chop and sprinkle into a baking dish (30cm x 35cm)., Slice all the fish into bite-sized pieces and add to the dish, halve and add the prawns (deveining, if needed), then dot the lobster meat in and around. Pour over the sauce, top with the mash, then drizzle lightly with oil and poke in your lobster claws (if using)., Bake for 1 hour, or until golden, bubbling and the fish is cooked through."

You can find a recipe for my Super-quick batch pesto, if you'd like to have a go at making your own., Turn the heat under the pan up to full whack and tip in the mussels. Stir in the remaining pesto, the courgettes, tomatoes and peas., Add the wine (if using), or a good splash of water.

Stir in the remaining pesto, the zucchini, tomatoes, and peas., Add the wine (if using), or a good splash of water.

Deseed and finely chop the chilli., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat, then add the shallots, garlic and chilli. Cook for 3 minutes, or until softened but not coloured. Set aside on a plate to cool., Roughly chop and place the cod into a blender, then pulse for 20 to 30 seconds; it should still have some texture., Scoop it into a bowl, add the crabmeat and stir to combine., Peel and devein the prawns, roughly chop, then add to the bowl with the cooled shallot mixture. Season and mix well., Divide the mixture into four equal portions and use your hands to mould them into patties. Put them on a plate in the fridge for 45 minutes., Get your barbecue going to a high heat, then make the mayo., Put the egg yolks and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice into a bowl and whisk to combine., Keep whisking while you add the sunflower oil – slowly add it in drips to begin with, then gradually pour it in a steady stream until it’s all incorporated and the mayo is thick., Finely grate or stir in the wasabi until combined, and season with a pinch of sea salt. Finely chop and stir in the rocket (if using). Set aside in the fridge until needed., When you’re ready to cook, trim and thread the lettuces onto a large barbecue skewer., Brush the seafood patties with a little oil and place them on the barbecue for 3 minutes., Turn and cook for a further 3 minutes, adding the lettuce skewer at the same time. Char them for about 1½ minutes on each side., Halve and pop the burger buns on to toast for 10 to 20 seconds, until bar–marked., To assemble your burger, place a couple of the baby gem leaves on the bottom half of each burger bun with some pickled onions, then top with the patties., Add a generous dollop of the wasabi mayonnaise, sandwich everything together with the bun tops and serve."

Fry the garlic and chorizo for 3 minutes, then deglaze the pan with the vinegar., Add the passata and 300ml of water, then the orzo. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the orzo is al dente, stirring occasionally to prevent it sticking., Spread the cherry tomatoes over a baking tray, drizzle with the rest of the oil and season. Roast for 10 minutes, or until soft., Stir half the basil into the pasta, along with the prawns., Divide between bowls, top with the remaining basil and serve the roasted tomatoes alongside."

The inspiration came from a Japanese gyoza recipe, but I’ve gone for more of a Vietnamese-style filling, which works so well. It’s light, full of flavour and a real pleasure. Pop them in the middle of the table, then get sharing and dipping – it’s about as romantic as it gets.  ”",407,0.8g,0.1g,34.2g,3.6g,26.3g,73.1g,2.7g,"200                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                raw peeled prawns, from sustainable sources, 1                                                                                                                                                                large                                                                                                                                                                shallot, 2                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    spring onions, ½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh coriander, 16                                                                                                                                                                                                                    round dumpling wrappers, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                glass noodles, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                unsalted peanuts, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    soft lettuce, a few                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh basil, a few                                                                                                                                                                sprigs of                                                                                                                                                                fresh mint, Lingham’s chilli sauce, DIPPING SAUCE, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    fresh red chilli, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lime, 4                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                caster sugar, 4                                                                                                                                                                tablespoons                                                                                                                                                                fish sauce","Start by making the dipping sauce. Finely chop the chilli, then combine with the lime juice (about 2 tablespoons), sugar, fish sauce and 8 tablespoons of water., Pour half into a cute bowl for dunking, and save the rest to dress your lettuce, herb and noodle salad., Smash the prawns with the side of your knife, then finely chop them. Peel and very finely chop the shallot and garlic, then trim and finely slice the spring onions (keep the white and green parts separate). Pick and finely chop the coriander leaves., Pop the prawns, shallot, garlic, coriander and the whites of the spring onions in a bowl, generously season with black pepper and a pinch of sea salt, and give it a good mix., Lay out your wrappers and spoon a teaspoon of filling into the middle of each. Brush the edges of one wrapper with water, fold it in half, then pleat and pinch the edges together to secure. Repeat with the others., You can steam the dumplings for 5 minutes, then fry the base until crispy. But the method I use is how I’ve seen it done in Japan. Place an oiled pan over a medium heat, add the dumplings and a splash of water, and cover. They’ll steam for 2 to 3 minutes, then once the water has evaporated, take off the lid and fry for a further 2 minutes., Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions. Toast the peanuts in a dry frying pan, then crush., Pick off and arrange the lettuce and herb leaves with the glass noodles on two plates, dress with the sauce and scatter the peanuts on top., Serve the dumplings sprinkled with the sliced green part of the spring onions, with bowls of dipping sauce and chilli sauce on the side."

                      , from sustainable sources, unpeeled","Make your dough first. Place the flour on a board or in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Beat the egg until smooth, then pour it into the well., Using the tips of your fingers, gradually mix the egg with the flour until combined. Knead the bits of dough into one smooth lump. You can also do this step in a food processor – just whiz the flour and egg until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip onto a work surface and bring together with your hands., Knead the dough to develop the gluten; this makes your pasta springy instead of flabby when you cook it. There’s no secret to kneading – you just have to bash the dough around a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, stretching it and squashing it again. Stop when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky., Wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes., It’s not the end of the world if you haven’t got a pasta machine, just use your rolling pin. The problem you’ll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces. You’ll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than you’ll get from a machine., If using a machine, make sure it’s firmly clamped to a clean, long work surface. Dust the surface with flour, then take a lump of dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips., Set the pasta machine at its widest setting and roll the dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks. Click the machine down a setting and roll the dough through again., Fold the dough in half, click the machine back up to the widest setting and roll it through again. Repeat 5 or 6 times., Work the dough through all the machine’s settings, from the widest to the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the dough with flour every time you run it through. When you reach the narrowest setting, fold the dough in half, then in half again, then once more into a squarish piece of dough., Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll through the settings for the last time, you should get a silky, rectangular sheet of pasta with straight edges., For the lasagne sheets needed in this recipe, keep rolling the pasta until it’s somewhere between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card., Cut the pasta into 6 sheets of 8cm x 30cm, and cut the rest into 8cm x 12cm sheets. It dries faster than you might think, so don’t wait more than a minute or two to cut it. Lay a damp tea towel on top of the pasta to help prevent it drying out., Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4., For the béchamel sauce, place the milk and saffron in a saucepan and bring almost to the boil., In a second pan, melt 75g of the butter. Stir in the flour to make a paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the hot milk to the pan, a ladleful at a time, whisking as you go., Gently bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for around 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until you have a thick, smooth sauce. Finely grate and stir in most of the Parmesan and season well., Scrub and debeard the mussels, discarding any that remain open when tapped. Halve the sole fillets lengthways, then thinly slice the salmon., Melt the remaining butter in a large, deep frying pan. Peel, finely slice and fry the garlic over a medium heat for 1 minute, or until golden., Add the rosemary sprigs and anchovies to the pan and fry for a few more minutes, or until the anchovies have dissolved., Add the mussels, shake the pan and cook, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the mussels have all opened (throw away any that haven’t after this time)., Turn off the heat, then remove the mussels from their shells, putting the meat back into the pan (discard the shells). Stir to coat in the garlicky juices, discard the rosemary sprigs, then stir the mussel mixture through the béchamel sauce., Grease 6 individual baking dishes (measuring about 12cm x 16cm each) with a little oil and bring a large pan of salted water to the boil., Cook the sheets of pasta, a few pieces at a time, for about 1 minute. Remove with tongs and spread over a clean tea towel to drain., To assemble, place a long sheet of lasagne across each dish so that it overhangs the sides. Add a mixed layer of lemon sole and salmon, then spoon over a layer of the béchamel. Top with a smaller rectangle of pasta., Repeat until you get to the last of the béchamel sauce, then fold over the overhanging pasta to enclose. Top each lasagne with a king prawn, then scatter over the remaining Parmesan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling at the edges. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving."

I know lobster is seen as elitist food, but in Britain we’re never that far from the shore, so you can get lobster from any decent fishmonger. I made mini burgers on the day, but have written this recipe for regular ones – the process is the same, so do whichever you prefer. I’m only using the tail meat, but feel free to use the claws, too. ”",644,41g,7.2g,7.7g,,42.3g,26.3g,,"1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    cooked 700-800g lobsters, from sustainable sources, olive oil, 1                                                                                                                                                                heaped teaspoon                                                                                                                                                                Dijon mustard, 4                                                                                                                                                                thin rashers of                                                                                                                                                                higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon, 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    burger buns, 1                                                                                                                                                                clove of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, tomato ketchup, mayonnaise, made using free-range eggs, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    lemon, 1                                                                                                                                                                handful of                                                                                                                                                                watercress, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    soft round lettuce, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    red onion, GRATED TOMATO SALSA, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ripe tomatoes (use 1 yellow if you like), ½                                                                                                                                                                a                                                                                                                                                                fresh red chilli, extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar","For the salsa, put a fine-to-coarse grater over a chopping board and grate your tomatoes to a slurry. You’ll end up with seeds and skin on one side, slurry on the other – get rid of the seeds and skin., Grate in the chilli and season well. Add a lug of oil, a swig of vinegar and stir in some chopped fresh herbs, if you have any., Twist off the lobster tails, then cut into 2cm slices (use the rivets of the tail as guides). Leave the shell on to protect the meat as it cooks and help keep its shape., Toss the chunks in oil, sea salt, black pepper and mustard, then barbecue for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until cooked. Peel., Barbecue the bacon, turning after a couple of minutes, till golden and crispy., Halve and toast the buns at the same time, then lay the bottom halves on a nice board. Halve the garlic and rub the cut side over each one., Drizzle with oil, then add a tiny blob of ketchup, 1 teaspoon of mayo and a squeeze of lemon juice., Click off the lettuce leaves and place one onto each bun with a nice wodge of watercress. Top with the lobster and salsa, and crumble over the bacon., Peel, finely slice and scatter over some red onion, and top with the bun lid. Secure the burgers with skewers, then serve."

If you don’t have a thermometer, carefully lower in a small piece of bread; if it bubbles to the surface, the oil is ready. While it’s heating, and while you’re cooking with it, always keep an eye on hot oil and be careful around it, as it can burn badly., While the oil is heating, make the batter.

stock. Peel and roughly chop the onion, then peel the garlic, keeping them whole., Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat and sauté the onion, garlic, paprika, bay leaves and prawn shells and heads for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally., Add the wine and fish stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, or until it starts to reduce., Strain through a colander into a large jug and set aside until needed (when you come to make the paella, just reheat the stock until hot, but not boiling)., For the sofrito, peel and dice the onions and garlic, then add to a large frying pan over a medium-low heat with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and the paprika. Fry for 7 to 8 minutes, or until softened and golden., Pour in the wine and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, then coarsely grate in the tomatoes, discarding the skins. Stir and cook for 5 minutes., Lower the heat and simmer for another 30 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened into a lovely sauce. Transfer to a bowl until ready to use., To make the paella, deseed and roughly chop the peppers. Cut the monkfish into large chunks, then slice the squid. Wash the mussels and clams thoroughly, discarding any that remain open when tapped., Heat half of the olive oil in a large paella pan over a medium heat and cook the peppers for 5 minutes, until softened. Transfer to a separate bowl with a slotted spoon. Set aside., Add the monkfish to the pan, season generously and cook for 10 minutes, or until tender. Set aside in a bowl., Throw the squid into the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then tip it into the bowl with the monkfish. Set aside until ready to use., Add the remaining oil to the pan, scatter in the rice in an even layer and sauté over a medium heat, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the rice is golden., Stir the sofrito into the rice and cook for 2 minutes, then add the hot prawn stock and bring the mixture to the boil for another 2 minutes., Sprinkle the saffron and paprika over the rice, reduce the heat to low and simmer, without stirring, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has almost been absorbed., Arrange the peppers, monkfish, squid, prawns, mussels and clams evenly around the top of the paella. Cook for about 8 minutes, turning the prawns halfway through, or until the mussels and clams have opened (discard any that don’t) and the prawns are cooked., Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, cover the pan with tin foil and a few clean tea towels and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving."

Cook for 2 minutes, add the red onion mix and continue cooking until the liquid has reduced to almost nothing. Season to taste. Leave to cool to room temperature, then place in the fridge to chill., To make the stew, chop the tomatoes, pick and roughly chop the tarragon and chervil., Place the fish stock, tomatoes, half the tarragon, saffron, butter and 200ml of the shellfish stock in a pan. Bring to the boil, then reduce by three-quarters. Blitz in a food processor, pass through a sieve and keep it warm while you cook the shellfish., Place a large lidded pan over a high heat, add the mussels and cockles, pour in 100ml water and immediately put on the lid. Steam the mussels and cockles for 2 minutes to open them, then drain. Discard any that have not opened., Once they are cool enough to handle, pick the mussels and cockles from the shells (keep 18 in their shells for presentation), place on a plate, and leave in the fridge to chill., Reheat the oven to 200ºC/gas 6., Heat a little olive oil in a non-stick pan over a medium heat, and add the cod (you can do this in batches). Cook for 1 to 2 minutes on one side, or until slightly golden, turn over, then transfer to a baking tray. Roast for 4 to 5 minutes, or until cooked through., While it’s cooking, heat a little more olive oil to the pan over a medium heat, add the squid, and sauté for 2 minutes, or until just cooked., Bring the stew to the simmer, add the mussels and cockles and warm through. Remove the cod from the oven and place on a serving dish with a dollop of the marmalade., Pour over the stew liquor, spoon on the mussels and cockles and top with the squid, a scattering of tarragon and chervil and a drizzle of olive oil.

Pick in most of the basil leaves (finely chop and reserve the stalks), 1 of the chillies, the red wine vinegar and a lug of oil. Season lightly and blitz to a paste., Remove the prawn shells, leaving the tails on. Butterfly the prawns by cutting along the back of each, and opening them up like a book., Place into a bowl, add the basil paste, and mix well to coat. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to marinate in the fridge for a few hours, or ideally overnight., Score a cross in the top of each tomato, pop them in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave them for a minute or so, until the skin starts to peel away., Drain the tomatoes and leave to cool slightly, then peel off the skins (discard them) and roughly chop the flesh. Set aside., Just before you want to cook the prawns, prepare your sauce. Place a saucepan over a medium heat and add a lug of oil. Chop the aubergines into 3cm cubes, then fry for 10 minutes, or until golden and starting to soften, stirring frequently., Deseed and finely slice the remaining chilli, then peel and finely slice the rest of the garlic. Add both into the pan, followed by the oregano and basil stalks. Fry for a few minutes, then stir in the tomatoes., Add a few splashes of water, bring it to a simmer, then reduce the heat a little and keep it simmering for about 30 minutes, until the aubergine has cooked down and the sauce is thick., Just before the sauce is done, place a griddle pan over a high heat. Once it’s screaming hot, cook your prawns for 1½ minutes on each side, until charred, pink and cooked. Drop the prawns into the sauce as you go., Stir the remaining basil leaves into the sauce, then serve it topped with a few rocket leaves, if you like."

Peel and finely chop the ginger, then finely chop the chilli., Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the red onion, coriander stalks (not leaves) and dried spices, then fry for about 1 minute, until the mustard seeds start to pop., Add the chopped ginger and green chilli, then cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the onions have softened, stirring occasionally., To prepare the rice, peel and finely chop the onion, then add to a pan over a medium heat with 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil and the butter. Cook for 5 minutes, or until just colouring. Put a kettle of water on to boil., Sprinkle in the spices, keeping the dried chilli whole (if using), and cook for 1 minute. Turn up the heat, add the rice and stir well., Fill the mug you used for the rice with boiling water (about 350ml, or twice the volume of the rice) and add to the pan, with a good pinch of sea salt. Bring to the boil, cover and reduce the heat., Simmer for 12 to 15 minutes over a low heat, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked., Roughly chop the fresh tomatoes and add to the spiced onions with a splash of boiling water. Bring to the boil, season, then simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened and darkened slightly., Stir in the prawns and coconut milk and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and cooked through., Fluff up the rice with a fork, then serve with the curry, removing the chilli (if using), and a scattering of the coriander leaves on top."

                sichuan seasoning","First, make the sichuan seasoning. Dry-roast the sichuan pepper and 3 teaspoons of sea salt in a heavy-based pan. When the peppercorns start to pop and become aromatic, remove from the heat and allow to cool. Once cool, grind to a powder in a pestle and mortar or spice grinder., Next, make the chilli dressing. Place the chilli flakes in a heatproof bowl. Heat the oil in a small heavy-based frying pan until it shimmers slightly, then carefully pour the oil over the chilli to release the heat and flavour., Stir, then let stand, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Strain the oil through a fine sieve over a bowl (discard the chilli), and mix with remaining dressing ingredients., For the wontons, peel, dice and place the prawn meat in a bowl. Trim and finely slice the spring onion, peel and finely slice the ginger, then add to the bowl with all the remaining ingredients, except the wonton wrappers, and mix until combined. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes., For each wonton, place a rounded teaspoon of prawn filling in the centre of a wrapper. Dip your finger in some water and moisten the bottom edge of the wrapper, then fold it in half, towards you, to enclose the filling. Smoothing out any air, press to seal. Hold the wonton lengthways with the folded edge down. Fold in half lengthways, then lightly moisten one corner of the folded edge. Bring the two ends together with a twisting action and press lightly to seal, making a ring shape., Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Carefully drop the wontons, in batches, into the water and cook for 2 minutes, or till just cooked through. To test if the wontons are ready, remove one using a slotted spoon and cut through it with a sharp knife. The prawns should be just cooked through. Remove the other wontons and drain in a colander., To serve, arrange the wontons on a serving platter. Stir the chilli dressing and then spoon it over the wontons. Serve immediately, sprinkled with sichuan seasoning."

Make sure they are all tightly closed., Peel and very finely slice the garlic, Pick the thyme, and drain and finely slice the peppers., Place a deep pan, big enough to hold all the clams, over a high heat. Add the clams and a splash of water and cover with a lid. Cook over a high heat, shaking now and then, until all the clams have opened, then tip onto a tray and leave to cool., Snip each bacon rasher into three and place the pieces in a non-stick frying pan. Gently cook over a medium heat just until the bacon is just starting to crisp on both sides., Lift the pieces of bacon out of the pan onto a plate and put the pan back on the heat. Add the butter, garlic and thyme and, when sizzling, add the breadcrumbs. Fry, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden and season with sea salt and black pepper. Take the crumbs off the heat and leave them to cool., When the clams are cool enough to handle, remove from the shells and chop each into quarters. Tip them into a bowl, add a squeeze of lemon juice, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of seasoning., Rinse the shells and spread out on a large roasting tray., Place a few pepper strips into each shell, followed by 1 tablespoon of breadcrumbs. Nestle a couple of clam quarters in each one and cover with more crumbs. Top with a piece of bacon and drizzle extra virgin olive oil., Once all the clams are filled, pop the tray on a low shelf under the hot grill for 4 to 5 minutes, or until everything is warmed through, the bacon is sizzling and the crumbs are golden brown. Serve with the remaining lemon cut into wedges for squeezing over."

large pan with a splash of olive oil, then place on a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until browned., Peel the prawns, adding the heads and shells to the pan. Add the cayenne and stock, bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, thickly slice the chorizo. Peel the onion and celery, deseed the peppers, then roughly chop. Peel the garlic, then finely slice with the chillies. Scrub the sweet potatoes and chop into 3cm chunks., Place a large pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the chorizo, rosemary and thyme sprigs, and 2 bay leaves. Cook for 5 minutes, or until browned, then remove everything to a plate., Generously season the chicken with sea salt and black pepper, then place in the pan, skin side down. Turn the heat up to high and cook for 10 minutes, or until browned, turning occasionally. Remove to a plate., Add the chopped onion, celery, peppers, garlic and chillies to the pan with the cayenne and the remaining 2 bay leaves. Cook on a medium heat for 10 minutes, or until softened., Stir in the flour to coat, then sieve in 2 ladlefuls of the stock. Return the chicken and chorizo to the pan, along with the sweet potatoes and the tomatoes. Bring to the boil, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Cover and simmer for 40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender., Finely slice the Scotch bonnets (blanch them first in boiling water to reduce the heat, if you like). Bash the bay in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of salt, discarding the stalks. Muddle in a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and a splash of vinegar. Stir in the chopped chillies and set aside., Slice the okra and add to the gumbo pan for a further 10 minutes. Gently fold in the crabmeat and prawns for a final 5 minutes, or until cooked through. Season to perfection., Finely chop and scatter over the parsley, then serve with the pickled chillies. Good with brown rice and green salad."

lightly score the skin, then lightly score the scallops in a criss-cross pattern. Peel the prawns, leaving the heads and tails on (for bonus flavour), then run the tip of a knife down their backs and pull out the vein. Put it all into a bowl., Pick through the mussels and clams, discarding any that remain open when tapped. Put aside in a separate bowl., To make the marinade, trim the lemongrass, peel the garlic and ginger, then roughly chop with the lime leaves, half the chilli (deseed first, if you like) and the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves). Scrape into a pestle and mortar and bash to a smooth paste., Muddle in the fish and soy sauces, squeeze in the juice of 1 lime, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper., Quarter the bok choi, halve the sugar snaps lengthways, trim the broccoli, then slice the choi sum into 5cm chunks., Tear off a 60cm-long piece of wide tin foil and place a slightly smaller piece of greaseproof paper on top. Pile on the greens, add the fish and seafood, then drizzle over the marinade., Beat the egg and brush it around the foil edges, then place another large piece of foil on top. Leaving about 5cm around the filling, fold in the foil to create a sealed parcel., Place on a baking tray, being careful not to pierce the foil, and place the tray on the bottom of the oven for 15 minutes., Meanwhile, put the rice and coconut cream into a medium pan with twice the volume of boiling salted water. Bring to the boil, then cover and cook on a low heat until tender., Remove the fish parcel from the oven and very carefully cut it open (mind out for the steam!). Place on a platter, discarding any mussels or clams that haven’t opened., Finely slice and scatter over the remaining chilli, tear over the coriander leaves, and serve with the rice and lime wedges for squeezing over."

Muddle in 1 tablespoon of oil, the paprika, saffron and a swig of boiling water to make a marinade., Use little scissors to cut down the back of each prawn shell and remove the vein. Cut 1 orange into wedges, toss with the prawns and the marinade and leave aside for 10 minutes., Put the couscous into a bowl and just cover with boiling water, then pop a plate on top and leave to fluff up., Take a bit of pride in finely chopping all your colourful seasonal veg and chilli, and put them into a nice serving bowl., Pick a few pretty mint leaves and put to one side, then pick and finely chop the rest and add to the bowl with the juice of the lemon and the remaining orange. Add the couscous, toss together and season to perfection., Put a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat. Add the prawns, marinade and orange wedges and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the prawns are gnarly and crisp, then arrange on top of the couscous., Dollop with yoghurt, then halve the pomegranate and, holding it cut side down in your fingers, bash the back so the sweet jewels tumble over everything. Sprinkle with the reserved mint leaves and serve."

Very finely slice the chives and prawns, then place it all into a bowl with the crabmeat, oyster sauce and sesame oil. Mix well to combine., Lay the wonton wrappers on a clean work surface and cover with a damp tea towel to stop them drying out. Lightly dust a tray with cornflour and place a small bowl of water alongside it. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the filling onto the middle of a wrapper, brush the edges with a little water, then bring them up over the filling, pinching them to seal. Place on the flour-dusted tray, then repeat with the remaining ingredients – you should end up with 30 in total., Pour 5cm of boiling water into a wok or saucepan over a medium-high heat and bring to the boil. Cut out a circle of greaseproof paper so it fits snugly into a bamboo steamer, grease one side with oil, then place oil-side up into the steamer. Add the wontons in a single layer (you’ll need to do this in batches), place the basket on top of the pan, cover and steam for 7 to 8 minutes, or until cooked through. Serve with chilli sauce."

Coarsely grate the palm sugar into a bowl, add the tamarind paste, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, a dash of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of boiling water and mix well so the sugar dissolves. Taste, and adjust the flavours if needed – you’re looking for sweet, sour and slightly salty., Halve, deseed and finely slice the chillies, then place in a bowl with the juice from 1 lime to make a quick pickle., Drain the noodles and toss in a little oil., Peel and roughly chop the shallots, then trim and finely slice the chives. Pick and roughly chop most of the basil and mint leaves., Slice the tofu into rough 1cm chunks. Run the tip of a knife down the back of each prawn and pull out the vein, meaning they’ll butterfly as they cook. Rinse the dried shrimps under cold running water, then pat dry with kitchen paper., Place a large wok on a medium heat with a splash of oil, then add the dried shrimps, peanuts and chilli flakes. Toss for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden., Take the pan off the heat, transfer half the mixture to a pestle and mortar and lightly crush, keeping to one side. Return the pan to a medium-high heat with another splash of oil, adding the shallots to the mix. Fry for 2 minutes, or until turning golden., Toss in the prawns, chives, chopped herbs and shredded radish, then cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes, or until the prawns are almost cooked through., Beat and add the egg, cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then fold through and toss in the tofu, noodles, beansprouts and tamarind sauce until well combined., Divide the pad Thai between bowls, sprinkle over the crushed nut mixture from the mortar and pick over the remaining mint and basil leaves.

Traditionally, it comes from Cantonese cuisine, where heat was achieved using finely ground peppercorns, but I couldn’t resist adding a few chillies here for double pleasure. ”",343,18.7g,2.4g,1g,1.4g,22.6g,22.6g,1.1g,"½                                                                                                                                                                a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                fresh mint                                                                                                                                                                , (15g), 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                    spring onions, 8                                                                                                                                                                medium                                                                                                                                                                whole squid                                                                                                                                                                , (500g), gutted, cleaned, from sustainable sources, vegetable oil                                                                                                                                                                , for frying, white pepper, 100                                                                                                                                                                g                                                                                                                                                                plain flour, 1                                                                                                                                                                small handful of                                                                                                                                                                fresh mixed-colour chillies, 4                                                                                                                                                                cloves of                                                                                                                                                                garlic, 1                                                                                                                                                                tablespoon                                                                                                                                                                white or red wine vinegar","Pick the mint leaves into a small bowl of cold water to ensure they stay super-fresh., Trim the spring onions and halve across the middle, then finely slice lengthways and add to the water bowl., Pat the squid dry with kitchen paper, then use a regular eating knife to lightly score the inside of the squid at ½cm intervals at an angle. Turn the squid through 90° and do the same again to create a criss-cross pattern., When you’re ready to cook, just under half fill a large sturdy pan with oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go., While it heats, tip 1 heaped tablespoon of white pepper and the flour into a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt. Add the squid, toss and mix together to coat, then leave in the flour for a few minutes while you prick the chillies – if some are bigger, halve and deseed them first – then peel and finely slice the garlic 1mm thick, ideally on a mandolin (use the guard!)., When you’re ready to fry, add half the squid and chillies – it’s important to cook in two batches so you don’t overcrowd the pan. When it’s all looking golden and lovely (after about 1½ minutes), add half the garlic for a final minute., Use a slotted spoon to scoop everything into a bowl or pan lined with kitchen paper to drain while you cook the second batch., Whip out the paper, then cut the squid into bite-sized pieces and return to the bowl. Drizzle with the vinegar, add a good pinch of seasoning, the drained mint leaves and spring onion curls, toss it all together and serve right away."

Stone the olives and tear into thirds or quarters. Next, add the fennel seeds to a pestle and mortar with a pinch of salt and smash to a powder. Tip into a cup and put aside., Finely grate the Parmesan. Pick the basil leaves and set aside. Roughly chop the stalks, then add to the pestle and mortar and smash to a paste with a pinch of salt. Mix 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a grating of lemon zest and the juice of half the lemon with the basil paste. Spoon it out onto a plate and place the tuna steaks on top. Turn the tuna over in the dressing, then leave them to marinate for about 20 minutes in the fridge., Meanwhile, fill and boil the kettle. Put a deep pasta pan on a medium heat and fill with boiling water, add a good few pinches of salt and bring back to the boil. Drop the spaghetti into the water and cook according to packet instructions. Once cooked, scoop out half a mug of cooking water, then drain the pasta., Meanwhile, put a medium saucepan over a medium heat, then add a splash of olive oil and the garlic. As soon as the garlic is golden, tip in the bashed-up fennel seeds and the cherry tomatoes. Season with a little pepper, cover with a lid and turn the heat down to low. Cook gently for 5 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and sweet, then turn the heat off. Tip the drained pasta into the pan with the cherry tomatoes, stir together and season with a little salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, if needed. Cover with a lid., Put a griddle pan on a medium heat. Tear the basil leaves into a bowl with the olives. Add the rocket, then dress the salad with a squeeze of juice from the remaining lemon half and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Finely chop and sprinkle over the chilli., Season the tuna with a little salt, then place in the hot griddle pan and cook for 30 seconds on each side for rare, or for a bit longer if you prefer it more well done. Stir the grated Parmesan into the spaghetti, adding a splash of the reserved cooking water to loosen, if needed.  Divide the spaghetti between your plates, lay a tuna steak next to each pile and top with a good pinch of the olive salad."

It’s not quite the same, but it’ll still taste delicious., If you’re cooking outdoors, nestle the oysters in the ash of your fire for around 10 minutes, or until the oysters pop open (some might stay closed, but don’t worry, you’ll just need to apply a little extra force to get these ones open)., If cooking indoors, preheat the oven to full whack. Place the rock salt into an ovenproof frying pan, then pop in the oven to preheat for around 20 minutes, before carefully placing the oysters on top and returning to the oven for 10 minutes., Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, then cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it turns a deep golden colour and starts to sizzle. Add a few drops of Tabasco to taste, then remove from the heat and add a squeeze of lemon juice, swirling the pan until combined.

Place over a high heat and bring to the boil, then cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender., Meanwhile, using a sharp knife, roughly chop the bacon into chunky lardons, roughly ½cm thick. Score the scallops in a criss-cross fashion about 1cm deep on one side, season with a pinch of salt, then set aside., Drain and allow the potatoes to steam dry, then return to the empty pan with the milk, a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mash until smooth, then cover until needed., Heat a splash of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, then add the bacon and fry for around 2 minutes, or until golden. Move the bacon to one side of the pan, then pick the sage leaves into the space. Cook for 1 minute, or until crisp, then move to the side of the pan along with the bacon. Add the remaining butter and the scallops, cut-side down, to the empty space. Cook for around 2 minutes, or until golden, turning halfway., Remove from the heat, add a squeeze of lemon juice and toss to coat, allowing the scallops to cook in the hot pan for a further 30 seconds. Divide the creamy mash between plates, then spoon over the scallops, bacon, sage and any lovely juices from the pan, then tuck in."

Heat a lug of olive oil in a medium frying pan over a low heat, then finely slice and add 2 garlic cloves. Fry for a few seconds, or until lightly golden, then add the chillies and tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon. Bring to the boil, then reduce to low and simmer for around 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, mash well with a potato masher, then set the arrabbiata sauce aside., Cook the spaghetti according to packet instructions in a large pan of salted boiling water over a high heat., Meanwhile, pick the parsley leaves and set aside for later, then finely slice the stalks. Halve the squid tentacles, thinly slice the tubes, then finely slice the remaining garlic. Preheat a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the parsley stalks, garlic, clams, wine and 2 large spoonfuls of arrabbiata sauce, then stir well. Add the squid and toss well to coat. Cover and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the clams have opened., Drain the spaghetti, reserving a cupful of the cooking water, then add to the clams. Roughly chop and add the parsley leaves, toss well, adding a splash of the reserved cooking water to loosen, if needed.

You’ll get small, dainty portions, but each bite will be a real wake-up for the senses. Tartare is seen as a really cheffy thing to make, because most people, unless they’re quite foodie, won’t eat raw meat or fish at home. But if you get some insanely fresh sustainable tuna that looks the business – purply pink and glossy with a fresh smell of the sea – this will be heaven., Pour a few good lugs of olive oil into a small pan over a medium heat. Gently fry the garlic slices until they are lightly golden crisps; don’t let them burn. Remove them to some kitchen paper to drain. Pick 8 coriander leaves and put them to one side in a little cup of cold water., This is best served right away while the flavours are all super fresh, so when you’re ready to eat, put half your bunch of coriander, half your spring onion and half your chilli into a liquidizer and blitz with the juice of 1 lime and about the same amount of olive oil. Season with sea salt and black pepper and balance so it’s got attitude and a kick. If it needs to be loosened, add a tiny splash of water. Finely chop the remaining half of your coriander, spring onion and chilli on a board with the tuna until the mixture is as chunky or fine as you like., At this point you’re nearly ready to go, so lay 2 or 3 of your orange slices in the middle of 4 little plates and spoon your blitzed green sauce around them. Toss the tuna mixture in a bowl with the juice of the second lime and the same amount of olive oil. Have a taste, season it really well, then spoon your tuna tartare over your orange slices. Top with a few tomato quarters and a dollop of soured cream, then sprinkle over some of your garlic chips and your pretty coriander leaves. Serve right away with wedges from your third lime. If you want to add some more sliced chilli or a pinch of paprika, rock on!"

Pick the herbs and cress, and place in the fridge., You can assemble the ceviche just before your guests are ready to eat, but it’s important that you don’t leave the fish marinating for too long – you don’t want the acids in the juices to cook the fish. Pour the lemon dressing over the fish mixture and immediately mix it up. Leave it to sit for about 2½ minutes while you lay out the plates., Throw most of the herb mixture into the bowl with the fish and very quickly toss it together – no more than 10 seconds., Divide the ceviche between 4 plates, gently spoon over a little of the dressing (discarding the rest) and sprinkle with the remaining herbs., Drizzle over a little oil from a height, sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper, and enjoy."

The way I heard it, this brilliant rub was invented by an African-American chef working at Commander’s Palace, a posh New Orleans restaurant. The famous head chef there, Paul Prudhomme, took this recipe, added his own little tweaks and introduced blackened fish to the rest of the world. Basically it’s a bold rub that fragrantly flavours fish and meat and goes dark when it cooks, thanks to the paprika and garlic., Traditionally this dish has been made with the locally caught redfish, but it’s also great with any whole or filleted white fish. It goes with so many things, including chicken, pork, lamb and steak. When I was in Louisiana I cooked it on a barbecue, but I’ve shown you below how to do it indoors in a pan. Don’t be scared by how black the spices go: they’ll look burnt but the taste will be amazing., To make the rub, bash up your fresh herbs and garlic in a pestle and mortar until you've got a nice coarse paste. Mix in the spices, 1 teaspoon of sea salt, 1 level tablespoon of black pepper and the olive oil, then squeeze in the juice of half the lemon, making sure not to let any pips get in there, and stir well., Lightly score the skin of your fish in lines about 2cm apart. Using your fingers, smear the rub all over both sides of the fish and into the cuts you've made. Put a non-stick pan or griddle pan over a medium-high heat and let it get nice and hot. Place your fish in the pan, skin side down, and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes. It will get quite smoky, so you might want to open a window! Turn the heat down to low, then, very carefully, flip your fish over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side., Cut your remaining lemon half and your second lemon into wedges for squeezing over. Serve them with your fish, a nice salad and boiled or steamed new potatoes dressed in good olive oil or butter. Don’t forget a nice cold glass of wine!"

Heat a splash of oil in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat. Add the bacon, onion, celery and chilli and sweat down for 5 minutes, stirring, until soft but not browned., Peel the husk from the corn and slice off the kernels with a sharp knife. Add the sweetcorn and potato to the saucepan, along with the stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 10 minutes, or until the potato is soft. Blitz very roughly with a hand blender (or cool slightly, then blend in batches in a food processor, returning the chowder to the saucepan)., Add the mussels and cream, bring quickly to the boil and cook for a few minutes until the mussels have opened – discard any that remain closed. You can take the mussels out of their shells, if you like. Remove from the heat and season. Divide the chowder between bowls and serve sprinkled with the chopped parsley."

They’re at their best when the water is really cold, and if there’s a good fishmonger near you they should be able to track them down., The richness of the black pudding works really well with the clean taste of the scallops. And, if you haven’t eaten the roe (the orange bit on the scallop) before, give it a go. Just carefully trim them off the scallops then fry them for some added tastiness!, Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas mark 4. Tear the ciabatta into rough pieces and place in a baking tray. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Pop in the oven and cook for 10 minutes until you’ve got crispy, golden croutons., Put all the salad leaves in a big bowl. Finely slice the celery at an angle and add it to the bowl of salad with the celery leaves., Heat a frying pan on a medium heat. Split the black puddings lengthways, tear them open, crumble into the frying pan and fry until crispy. Don’t be scared if it looks very black and almost burnt - trust me, it will taste delicious. Once ready, remove to a plate and keep warm., Carefully slice the scallops in half so you have 2 rounds from each scallop and score them on one side with a little criss-cross. Season with a little salt and pepper and a sprinkling of lemon zest. Sear for a minute in a frying pan, scored-side down, with a touch of olive oil, and don’t be tempted to touch them! Add the roe to the pan now, too. After a minute, check the underside, and continue to fry until lovely and caramelised. Turn them over and allow the other side to do the same. Be careful not to overcook them though, a minute or so on each side is all they need., Arrange the salad leaves on a large platter, then nestle the lovely scallops in among them. Sprinkle over that wonderful, crispy black pudding and the croutons. Snip the salad cress over the top, and finish with a good squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil. What an amazing treat!"

Ideally, oysters should be straight out of the sea when you eat them., Give them a rinse in cold water before you start preparing them – this can be tricky so please be very careful!, To open them, you’ll need an oyster knife which is short, thick and quite blunt. Do not use a normal kitchen knife – it’s dangerous and you’ll probably snap the tip of the knife off! A screwdriver is probably a better bet if you don’t have an oyster knife., Hold the oyster curved-side down on a chopping board with a folded kitchen cloth between the shell and your hand – this is to help you get a good grip and protect your hand., Look for the hinge between the top shell and the bottom shell, and poke the knife tip into the crack. You need to push quite hard and work it in there but eventually you should be able to prise the top shell off. It’s not always that easy so it might be a good idea to try a few before dinner to get the hang of it. Wear an apron too in case you get a bit dirty., When you get the oyster open, throw away the top shell. If there is any seawater in the bottom shell with the oyster, try and keep it in there., Pick out any fragments of shell and place the oyster on a plate with a mound of rock salt or crushed ice in the middle., Season it however you like – I'm a big fan of lemon juice or Tabasco – then tip that lovely fresh oyster into your mouth!"

Add the coconut milk and stir well. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer., Add the prawns, red mullet and bream fillet pieces, cover with a lid and allow to simmer for 2–3 minutes. Next, add the mussels, cover with a lid, and cook for another 2–3 minutes, until all the shells are open. Discard any that remain shut., Finish with a splash of soy sauce and serve on some cooked egg noodles. Scatter with the reserved coriander leaves and the sliced red chilli."

When the temperature has reached 180°C, or slightly lower (check your thermometer), and the smoke and flames have died down, you can start cooking. Always keep an eye on the fire and top up the heat source, if needed., Clean and wash the shellfish, pulling the beards off the mussels and throwing away any open ones., Peel the garlic and bash with a good pinch of sea salt in a pestle and mortar until creamy, then finely grate in the lemon zest. Add a good pinch of black pepper and pour in enough oil to make a dressing., Tip the shellfish into a large roasting tray and drizzle with the dressing. Toss everything together, then spread the shellfish out into an even layer., Halve the lemons, add them to the tray, then slide the tray into the hot oven and roast for 10 minutes or until all the shells have opened and the prawns and scallops are golden and cooked through. Keep an eye on them and rotate the tray for even cooking., Pick and chop the herb leaves and serve the shellfish straight away, scattered with chopped herbs, and with lots of napkins!"

     grated fresh ginger","Tempura is a crisp batter which originates from Portuguese settlers in Japan and has become a part of Japanese culture. It’s great for battering fish, shellfish and vegetables. In Japan there are lots of tempura restaurants where everyone sits behind a bar and you get given the most amazing tempura for over two hours by a chef and his ‘master’, who does a lot of shouting., To kill the lobsters take a sharp knife, place it at the crown of the head, and cut straight down – this will kill them straight away. Twist off the tail and both claws. Cut the tail in half lengthways and each tail half into 3. Chop the claws into 3, slice up the remaining body meat, and place, with the tail pieces, in a bowl with any juice that comes out., Mix the dipping sauce ingredients together in a bowl and set aside., I suggest you use a deep-fat fryer as it’s easier to control. Heat it to 170°C/325°F. You can use a wok half-filled with oil, safely positioned on a stove with a thermometer, but be aware of other people (curious kids) and of possibly knocking things over if doing it this way. To make the batter, whisk the egg yolks and iced water together, add the cornflour and flour, and stir together using chopsticks – this helps to keep the batter a bit lumpy, which is what you want. Add the okra, chillies and lobster to the batter. Feel free to add any other veggies you fancy. Fine slices of sweet potato, whole spring onions, coriander stalks and baby courgettes with their flowers are all good. Once battered, pick up the lobster and veg and carefully put them into the oil., Don’t try to cook the tempura all at once – do them in 2 batches. Cook them until light golden and crisp on both sides. Drain them on some kitchen paper and then put them on to a plate. Serve the tempura with the dipping sauce and a dish of flavoured salt – I would suggest either jasmine tea salt or citrus salt., Try this: I once worked in a Japanese restaurant and when the chefs put the veg into the oil, they dripped extra batter from a height on to them. This gave the tempura a really crunchy, spiky look and feel. You don’t have to do this but it’s a good little trick."
